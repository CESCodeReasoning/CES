[REASONING]
The function `sum_up_to_n` is called with ( n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( n = 5 )).
First Iteration (current_number = 1):
    - current_number <= 5 when current_number=1
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (current_number = 2):
    - current_number <= 5 when current_number=2
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 3 ( 1 + 2 = 3 ).
Third Iteration (current_number = 3)
    - current_number <= 5 when current_number=3
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 6 ( 3 + 3 = 6 ).
Fourth Iteration (current_number = 4)
    -current_number <= 5 when current_number=4
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 10 ( 6 + 4 = 10 ).
Fifth Iteration (current_number = 5)
    -   current_number <= 5 when current_number=5
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 15 ( 10 + 5 = 15 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `total`, which is now 15.

[/QUESTION]

[REASONING]
The function `sum_elements` is called with ( elements = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
First Iteration:
    - elements = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], elements[-1] = 50.
    -`total += elements[-1]` updates `total` to 50 ( 0 + 50 = 50 ).
Second Iteration:
    - elements = [10, 20, 30, 40], elements[-1] = 40.
    -`total += elements[-1]` updates `total` to 90 ( 50 + 40 = 90 ).
Third Iteration:
    - elements = [10, 20, 30], elements[-1] = 30.
    -`total += elements[-1]` updates `total` to 120 ( 90 + 30 = 120 ).
Fourth Iteration:
    - elements = [10, 20], elements[-1] = 20.
    -`total += elements[-1]` updates `total` to 140 ( 120 + 20 = 140 ).
Fifth Iteration:
    - elements = [10], elements[-1] = 10.
    -`total += elements[-1]` updates `total` to 150 ( 140 + 10 = 150 ).
elements is empty, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `total`, which is now 150.
