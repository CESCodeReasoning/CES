Here are the fixed versions of the two Python functions, `has_close_elements` and `double_the_difference`, based on the specifications and test cases provided:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `double_the_difference`
```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if isinstance(i, int) and i > 0 and i % 2 != 0])

def check(double_the_difference):
    # Check some simple cases
    assert double_the_difference([]) == 0, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert double_the_difference([5, 4]) == 25, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (good for debugging!)"
    assert double_the_difference([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]) == 0, "This prints if this assert fails 3 (good for debugging!)"
    assert double_the_difference([-10, -20, -30]) == 0, "This prints if this assert fails 4 (good for debugging!)"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert double_the_difference([-1, -2, 8]) == 64, "This prints if this assert fails 5 (also good for debugging!)"
    assert double_the_difference([0.2, 3, 5]) == 34, "This prints if this assert fails 6 (also good for debugging!)"
    lst = list(range(-99, 100, 2))
    odd_sum = sum([i**2 for i in lst if i % 2 != 0 and i > 0])
    assert double_the_difference(lst) == odd_sum, "This prints if this assert fails 7 (good for debugging!)"

check(double_the_difference)
```

These corrected versions address the issues in the original code and should pass the provided test cases. The `has_close_elements` function now correctly calculates the absolute distance between elements, and the `double_the_difference` function correctly filters and sums the squares of positive odd integers.
