Here's the fixed code for both functions, `has_close_elements` and `eat`, with the corrections and improvements based on the provided specifications and test cases:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `eat`
```python
def eat(number: int, need: int, remaining: int) -> List[int]:
    if need <= remaining:
        return [number + need, remaining - need]
    else:
        return [number + remaining, 0]
```

These corrections ensure that the functions behave as expected based on the problem descriptions and pass all the provided test cases.
