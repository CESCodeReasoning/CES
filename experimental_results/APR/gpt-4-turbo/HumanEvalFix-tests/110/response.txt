Here's the fixed code for both functions, `has_close_elements` and `exchange`, with the corrections applied based on the specifications provided:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False

def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    needed_evens = sum(1 for x in lst1 if x % 2 != 0)
    available_evens = sum(1 for x in lst2 if x % 2 == 0)
    if available_evens >= needed_evens:
        return "YES"
    return "NO"
```

These functions now correctly implement the logic described in the problem statements:

1. `has_close_elements` checks if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold.
2. `exchange` determines if it's possible to exchange elements between two lists to make all elements of the first list even.
