Here are the fixed versions of both functions, `has_close_elements` and `is_prime`, with the necessary corrections and improvements:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `is_prime`
```python
def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

### Explanation for `is_prime` Fixes:
1. **Range of Checking**: The original code incorrectly started the loop at 1. Dividing by 1 is not useful for checking primality, and the loop should not include the number itself.
2. **Efficiency**: The fixed code uses a more efficient algorithm to check for prime numbers. It first handles the simplest cases (numbers less than or equal to 3) and even numbers directly. Then, it checks divisibility starting from 5 and only checks up to the square root of `n`, which is sufficient. It also skips even numbers by incrementing by 6 (after checking divisibility by 2 and 3).
3. **Correctness**: The original code would incorrectly return `True` for all numbers because it never checked divisibility correctly (the loop did not include any meaningful checks for numbers greater than 1).

These fixes ensure that both functions now meet their specifications and pass the provided tests.
