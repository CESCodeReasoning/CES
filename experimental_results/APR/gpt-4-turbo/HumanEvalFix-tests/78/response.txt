Here's the fixed code for both functions, `has_close_elements` and `hex_key`, with the necessary corrections and improvements:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `hex_key`
```python
def hex_key(num: str) -> int:
    primes = ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D')
    total = 0  # Initialize total to 0 instead of 1
    for i in range(0, len(num)):
        if num[i] in primes:
            total += 1
    return total
```

### Explanation of Fixes

1. **has_close_elements**:
   - The main issue was the lack of absolute value in calculating the distance between two elements. This could lead to incorrect results if the order of subtraction resulted in a negative number that was greater than the threshold when considered as a positive value.

2. **hex_key**:
   - The initial value of `total` was incorrectly set to 1. It should be 0 because we want to count from the start without any bias.
   - The function now correctly counts the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string.

These fixes ensure that the functions work as expected based on the provided specifications and test cases.
