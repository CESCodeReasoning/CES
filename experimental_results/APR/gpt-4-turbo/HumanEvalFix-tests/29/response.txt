Here are the fixed versions of both functions, `has_close_elements` and `filter_by_prefix`, with the corrections applied as per the specifications:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure the distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `filter_by_prefix`
```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]  # Use startswith instead of endswith to correctly filter by prefix
```

These corrections ensure that `has_close_elements` correctly calculates the absolute distance between elements to check against the threshold, and `filter_by_prefix` correctly filters strings that start with the specified prefix, rather than those that end with it.
