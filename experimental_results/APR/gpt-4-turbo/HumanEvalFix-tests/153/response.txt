Here is the fixed code for both functions, `has_close_elements` and `Strongest_Extension`, with the necessary corrections and improvements:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `Strongest_Extension`
```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name: str, extensions: List[str]) -> str:
    strong = extensions[0]
    my_val = len([x for x in extensions[0] if x.isalpha() and x.isupper()]) - len([x for x in extensions[0] if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])
    for s in extensions:
        val = len([x for x in s if x.isalpha() and x.isupper()]) - len([x for x in s if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])
        if val > my_val:
            strong = s
            my_val = val

    ans = class_name + '.' + strong  # Ensure to add a dot between class_name and strong extension
    return ans
```

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **has_close_elements**: The main issue was the lack of absolute value in calculating the distance. This has been corrected to ensure that the function correctly identifies when two elements are within the specified threshold distance.

2. **Strongest_Extension**: The primary issue was the missing dot in the concatenation of `class_name` and `strong`. This has been fixed to match the expected output format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`. Additionally, the logic itself was correct, but the output format needed adjustment.
