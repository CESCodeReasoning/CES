Here are the fixed versions of both functions, `has_close_elements` and `x_or_y`, with the corrections made to address the issues in the original code:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `x_or_y`
```python
def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    if n == 1:
        return y
    if n == 2:
        return x  # 2 is a prime number
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):  # Check divisibility up to the square root of n
        if n % i == 0:
            return y
    return x  # Return x if no divisors found, meaning n is prime
```

These fixes address the logical errors in the original implementations:

1. **has_close_elements**: The distance calculation now correctly uses the absolute value to ensure that the comparison against the threshold is valid regardless of the order of subtraction.

2. **x_or_y**: The function now correctly identifies prime numbers by checking divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. It also handles the special cases for `n = 1` and `n = 2` correctly.
