Here are the fixed versions of the provided Python functions, enclosed in the appropriate markdown for code formatting:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure the distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `is_equal_to_sum_even`

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n: int) -> bool:
    # Check if n is even and at least 8 (smallest sum of four positive even numbers)
    if n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8:
        return True
    return False
```

These fixes address the issues in the original code:
1. For `has_close_elements`, the absolute value is used to correctly calculate the distance between two numbers.
2. For `is_equal_to_sum_even`, the condition checks if `n` is even and greater than or equal to 8, which is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers (each being at least 2).
