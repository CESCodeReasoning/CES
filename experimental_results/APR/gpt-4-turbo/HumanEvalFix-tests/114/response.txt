Here are the fixed versions of the two functions `has_close_elements` and `minSubArraySum` as per the specifications provided:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `minSubArraySum`
```python
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    min_sum = float('inf')
    current_sum = 0
    for num in nums:
        current_sum += num
        if current_sum < min_sum:
            min_sum = current_sum
        if current_sum > 0:
            current_sum = 0
    return min_sum
```

These fixes address the issues in the original code:
- For `has_close_elements`, the absolute value of the difference is taken to correctly measure the distance between two numbers.
- For `minSubArraySum`, the logic is corrected to find the minimum sum of any subarray by resetting the current sum when it becomes positive, ensuring that we are always considering the smallest possible subarrays.
