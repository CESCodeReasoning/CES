Here is the fixed code for both functions, `has_close_elements` and `histogram`, with the necessary corrections and improvements:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `histogram`:
```python
def histogram(test: str) -> dict:
    words = test.split()
    frequency = {}
    max_count = 0

    for word in words:
        if word in frequency:
            frequency[word] += 1
        else:
            frequency[word] = 1
        if frequency[word] > max_count:
            max_count = frequency[word]

    # Filter to keep only the most frequent words
    most_frequent = {word: count for word, count in frequency.items() if count == max_count}
    return most_frequent
```

These fixes address the issues in the original code:
- In `has_close_elements`, the `abs` function is used to correctly calculate the absolute distance between two elements.
- In `histogram`, the code is optimized to count occurrences efficiently and only keep the entries with the maximum count, which simplifies the logic and improves performance.
