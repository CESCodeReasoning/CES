Here are the fixed versions of both functions, `has_close_elements` and `sum_product`, with the necessary corrections and improvements:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `sum_product`
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    sum_value = 0
    prod_value = 1  # Initialize product to 1 for correct multiplication, especially for empty list

    for n in numbers:
        sum_value += n
        prod_value *= n
    return sum_value, prod_value
```

These fixes address the issues in the original code:
- In `has_close_elements`, the distance calculation now correctly uses the absolute value to ensure that the comparison is based on the magnitude of the difference, not the direction.
- In `sum_product`, the product initialization is set to 1 instead of 0. This is crucial because any number multiplied by 0 is 0, which would incorrectly handle non-empty lists where the product should not be zero.
