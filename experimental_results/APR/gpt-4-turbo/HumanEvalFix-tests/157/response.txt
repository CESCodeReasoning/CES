Here are the fixed versions of the two functions, `has_close_elements` and `right_angle_triangle`, with the necessary corrections and improvements:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure the distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `right_angle_triangle`
```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Ensure that c is the largest side to apply the Pythagorean theorem correctly
    x, y, z = sorted([a, b, c])
    return z*z == x*x + y*y  # Check if the square of the largest side equals the sum of squares of the other two
```

These fixes address the following issues:
1. In `has_close_elements`, the absolute value is used to correctly calculate the distance between two numbers.
2. In `right_angle_triangle`, the sides are sorted to ensure that the largest side (hypotenuse in the case of a right triangle) is compared against the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This corrects the logic to handle cases where the sides are not given in a specific order.
