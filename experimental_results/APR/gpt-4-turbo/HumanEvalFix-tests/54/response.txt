Here are the fixed versions of the two functions, `has_close_elements` and `same_chars`, with the necessary corrections and improvements:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `same_chars`
```python
def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str) -> bool:
    return set(s0) == set(s1)  # Compare sets of characters to check if both strings have the same characters
```

These fixes address the issues in the original code:
- For `has_close_elements`, the absolute value is used to correctly calculate the distance between two numbers.
- For `same_chars`, the function now checks if the sets of characters from both strings are equal, which correctly determines if both strings contain the same characters regardless of order or frequency.
