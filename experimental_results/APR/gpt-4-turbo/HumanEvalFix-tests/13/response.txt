Here are the fixed versions of the provided Python functions, including the necessary corrections to ensure they work as intended:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure the distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `greatest_common_divisor`
```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a  # Return 'a' instead of 'b' after the loop, as 'b' will be zero when the loop exits
```

These corrections address the issues in the original code snippets:
- For `has_close_elements`, the distance calculation now correctly uses the absolute value to ensure that the comparison is valid regardless of the order of subtraction.
- For `greatest_common_divisor`, the return value is corrected to `a` instead of `b`, as `b` becomes zero when the Euclidean algorithm loop exits, making `a` the greatest common divisor at that point.
