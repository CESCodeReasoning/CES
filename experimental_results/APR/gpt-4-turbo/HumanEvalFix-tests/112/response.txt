Here are the fixed versions of the provided Python functions, `has_close_elements` and `reverse_delete`, with the necessary corrections and improvements:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `reverse_delete`

```python
def reverse_delete(s: str, c: str):
    # Create a set from c for faster lookup
    c_set = set(c)
    # Filter characters that are not in c
    filtered_s = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in c_set])
    # Check if the filtered string is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = filtered_s == filtered_s[::-1]
    return (filtered_s, is_palindrome)
```

These fixes address the following issues:
- In `has_close_elements`, the absolute value is used to correctly calculate the distance between two numbers.
- In `reverse_delete`, a set is used for characters in `c` to optimize the membership checking during the list comprehension. This function now correctly returns a tuple containing the filtered string and a boolean indicating whether the string is a palindrome.
