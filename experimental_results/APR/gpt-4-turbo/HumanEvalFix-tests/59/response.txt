Here are the fixed versions of the two functions, `has_close_elements` and `largest_prime_factor`, with the necessary corrections and improvements:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `largest_prime_factor`
```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:
    def is_prime(k: int) -> bool:
        if k <= 1:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(k**0.5) + 1):  # Check up to the square root of k for efficiency
            if k % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    largest = None
    for j in range(2, n + 1):
        if n % j == 0 and is_prime(j):  # Check if j is a prime factor of n
            largest = j  # Update largest since j is greater than all previous factors checked
    return largest
```

These corrections address the logical errors in the original code snippets:
- In `has_close_elements`, the absolute value is used to correctly calculate the distance between two numbers.
- In `largest_prime_factor`, the function now correctly checks if each divisor of `n` is prime and updates the largest prime factor found. The prime check is also optimized to run up to the square root of the number.
