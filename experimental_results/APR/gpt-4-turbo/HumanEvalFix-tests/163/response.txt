Here are the fixed versions of both functions, `has_close_elements` and `generate_integers`, with the corrections and improvements based on the specifications provided:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `generate_integers`
```python
def generate_integers(a: int, b: int) -> List[int]:
    lower = min(a, b)
    upper = max(a, b)
    return [i for i in range(lower, upper + 1) if i % 2 == 0]  # Include upper bound and check for even numbers
```

These fixes address the issues in the original code:
1. For `has_close_elements`, the use of `abs` ensures that the distance is always a non-negative value, which is crucial for correctly comparing it to the threshold.
2. For `generate_integers`, the range is corrected to include the upper bound by adding `+1` in the range function, and the logic for determining the lower and upper bounds is simplified to directly use `min` and `max`. This ensures that all even numbers between `a` and `b` (inclusive) are correctly generated.
