Here's the fixed code for the `sum_squares` function:

```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    import math
    squared = 0
    for i in lst:
        squared += math.ceil(i)**2
    return squared
```

This corrected version of the function correctly computes the sum of the squares of the ceiling values of the elements in the list, as specified in the problem statement.
