Here's the fixed code for both functions, `has_close_elements` and `pluck`, with the necessary corrections and improvements:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `pluck`
```python
def pluck(arr):
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return []
    evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, arr))
    if len(evens) == 0:
        return []
    min_even = min(evens)
    min_index = arr.index(min_even)
    return [min_even, min_index]
```

### Explanation of Fixes

#### `has_close_elements`:
- The main issue was the lack of `abs()` function to correctly calculate the distance between two numbers. Without it, the function could incorrectly ignore cases where `elem2` is greater than `elem`.

#### `pluck`:
- The function now correctly handles cases where there are no even numbers in the list by checking the length of the `evens` list instead of comparing it directly to an empty list.
- The function now returns the smallest even number along with its index in the original list, handling cases with multiple occurrences of the smallest even number by using the `index()` method, which returns the first occurrence.
