Here are the fixed versions of both functions, `has_close_elements` and `modp`, with the necessary corrections and improvements:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to calculate the correct distance
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `modp`
```python
def modp(n: int, p: int) -> int:
    ret = 1  # Initialize ret to 1, since 2^0 % p = 1
    for i in range(n):
        ret = (2 * ret) % p
    return ret
```

These fixes address the issues in the original code:
- For `has_close_elements`, the distance calculation now correctly uses the absolute value to ensure that the comparison is based on the magnitude of the difference, not the algebraic difference.
- For `modp`, the initialization of `ret` is set to 1 instead of 0, as 2^0 % p should be 1 for any p > 0. This change ensures that the function correctly computes 2^n % p.
