Here are the fixed versions of the provided Python functions, `has_close_elements` and `get_odd_collatz`, with the necessary corrections and improvements:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `get_odd_collatz`
```python
def get_odd_collatz(n: int) -> list:
    odd_collatz = []
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            odd_collatz.append(n)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2  # Use integer division
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
    odd_collatz.append(1)  # Ensure 1 is always included as the last element
    return sorted(odd_collatz)
```

### Explanation of Fixes

1. **has_close_elements**:
   - The main issue was the lack of the `abs()` function to correctly calculate the distance between two numbers. Without it, the function could incorrectly ignore cases where `elem2` is greater than `elem`.

2. **get_odd_collatz**:
   - The original code did not correctly handle the sequence generation, especially with the division operation which should use integer division (`//`) instead of floating-point division (`/`).
   - The condition to add odd numbers to the list was misplaced, causing it to miss some numbers.
   - The number `1` should always be included in the list, and it should be added after the loop to ensure it is included even if the starting number is `1`.
   - The list is sorted before returning, which is correct and aligns with the requirements.
