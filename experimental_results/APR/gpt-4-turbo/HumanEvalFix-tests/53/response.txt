Here are the fixed versions of the provided Python functions, `has_close_elements` and `add`, with the corrections made as per the specifications:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to calculate the correct distance
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `add`
```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y  # Correct the function to return the sum of x and y
```

These corrections ensure that the functions behave as expected according to the problem descriptions and test cases provided.
