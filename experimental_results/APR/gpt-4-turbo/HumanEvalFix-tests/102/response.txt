Here's the fixed code for both functions, `has_close_elements` and `choose_num`, based on the specifications and test cases provided:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `choose_num`
```python
def choose_num(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    if x > y:
        return -1
    # Find the largest even number in the range [x, y]
    if y % 2 == 0:
        return y
    elif (y - 1) >= x:
        return y - 1
    else:
        return -1
```

These fixes address the issues in the original code:
1. For `has_close_elements`, the main issue was the lack of absolute value in calculating the distance, which could lead to incorrect comparisons when one number is greater than the other.
2. For `choose_num`, the logic was restructured to correctly handle the range and check for even numbers, ensuring that the largest even number within the range is returned, or -1 if no such number exists.
