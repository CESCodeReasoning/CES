Here's the fixed code for both functions, `has_close_elements` and `get_closest_vowel`, with the necessary corrections and improvements:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `get_closest_vowel`
```python
def get_closest_vowel(word: str) -> str:
    if len(word) < 3:
        return ""

    vowels = {"a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "A", "E", "I", "O", "U"}
    # Start from the second last character and go to the second character
    for i in range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1):
        if word[i] in vowels:
            if word[i + 1] not in vowels and word[i - 1] not in vowels:
                return word[i]
    return ""
```

### Explanation of Fixes
1. **has_close_elements**: The main issue was the lack of absolute value in calculating the distance. This could lead to negative distances being incorrectly compared to the threshold. Using `abs()` ensures that the distance is always a non-negative number, which correctly represents the absolute difference between two numbers.

2. **get_closest_vowel**: 
   - The function now returns an empty string `""` instead of a space `" "` when no suitable vowel is found, as per the specification.
   - The loop correctly iterates from the second-to-last character to the second character, ensuring that the first and last characters are not considered.
   - The function now handles case sensitivity correctly by including both uppercase and lowercase vowels in the set.

These fixes ensure that the functions behave as expected according to the provided specifications and test cases.
