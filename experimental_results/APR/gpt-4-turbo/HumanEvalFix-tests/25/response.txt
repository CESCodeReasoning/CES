Here are the fixed versions of both the `has_close_elements` and `factorize` functions, including the necessary corrections to ensure they work as specified:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `factorize`
```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    import math
    factors = []
    # Check for number of 2s that divide n
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    # n must be odd at this point, thus a skip of 2 (i.e., 3, 5, 7, 9,...) is sufficient
    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
        # While i divides n, append i and divide n
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    # Condition if n is a prime number greater than 2
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

These corrections address the issues in the original code:
- For `has_close_elements`, the absolute value is used to correctly calculate the distance between two elements.
- For `factorize`, the loop starts from 1, which is incorrect as dividing by zero will raise an error. The corrected version starts checking from 2 and handles even and odd factors separately, ensuring all prime factors are correctly identified and listed.
