Here's the fixed code for both functions, `has_close_elements` and `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter`, with the necessary corrections and improvements:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter`
```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt: str) -> bool:
    if not txt:
        return False
    txt = txt.rstrip()  # Remove trailing spaces
    if not txt:
        return False
    last_char = txt[-1]
    return last_char.isalpha() and txt[-2] == ' ' if len(txt) > 1 else last_char.isalpha()
```

These fixes address the issues in the original code:
1. For `has_close_elements`, the use of `abs` ensures that the distance is always non-negative, which is crucial for comparing distances correctly.
2. For `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter`, the function now correctly handles cases where the last character might be surrounded by spaces or is the only character in the string. It also checks if the last character is an alphabet and if it is not part of a word (i.e., preceded by a space if it's not the only character).
