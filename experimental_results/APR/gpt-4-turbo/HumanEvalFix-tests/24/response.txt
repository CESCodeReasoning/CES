Here are the fixed versions of the two functions, `has_close_elements` and `largest_divisor`, along with the corrections made to the original buggy code:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to calculate the correct distance
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `largest_divisor`
```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    for i in reversed(range(1, n)):  # Start from 1 to n-1, reversed to find the largest first
        if n % i == 0:  # Check if i divides n evenly
            return i
```

These corrections address the logical errors in the original code:
- For `has_close_elements`, the distance calculation now correctly uses the absolute value to ensure that the comparison is based on the magnitude of the difference, not the direction.
- For `largest_divisor`, the loop now correctly iterates from `1` to `n-1` and checks for even divisibility using the modulus operator `%`. The loop is reversed to find the largest divisor first, ensuring efficiency.
