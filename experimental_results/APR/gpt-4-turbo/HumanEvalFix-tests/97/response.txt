Here are the fixed versions of the two functions, `has_close_elements` and `multiply`, based on the specifications and test cases provided:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `multiply`
```python
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return (a % 10) * (b % 10)
```

These fixes address the issues in the original code:
- For `has_close_elements`, the distance calculation now correctly uses the absolute value to ensure it checks the correct proximity regardless of the order of subtraction.
- For `multiply`, the function now correctly returns the product of the unit digits of the two numbers, as specified. The original code incorrectly multiplied the entire numbers again after taking the unit digits, which was not required.
