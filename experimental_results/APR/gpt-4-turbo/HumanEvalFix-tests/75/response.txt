Here is the fixed code for both functions, `has_close_elements` and `is_multiply_prime`, with the necessary corrections and improvements:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `is_multiply_prime`
```python
def is_multiply_prime(a: int) -> bool:
    def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        for j in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):  # Start from 2 and go up to the square root of n
            if n % j == 0:
                return False
        return True

    # Since a is less than 100, we only need to consider primes less than 100
    primes = [i for i in range(2, 101) if is_prime(i)]
    for i in primes:
        for j in primes:
            for k in primes:
                if i * j * k == a:
                    return True
    return False
```

These fixes address the following issues:
- In `has_close_elements`, the absolute value is used to correctly calculate the distance between two numbers.
- In `is_multiply_prime`, the `is_prime` function is corrected to avoid division by zero and to efficiently check for prime numbers. The function now iterates over a list of prime numbers, which is more efficient given the constraints.
