Here are the fixed versions of the two Python functions, `has_close_elements` and `count_up_to`, along with the corrections made to the original buggy code:

### Fixed Code for `has_close_elements`

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure the distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed Code for `count_up_to`

```python
def count_up_to(n):
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0:  # Corrected the modulus operation to check if i is divisible by j
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(i)
    return primes
```

These corrections address the logical errors in the original code snippets:

1. In `has_close_elements`, the distance calculation now correctly uses the absolute value to ensure that the comparison is based on the magnitude of the difference, not the direction.

2. In `count_up_to`, the modulus operation was corrected to `i % j` to properly check for divisibility, ensuring that the function correctly identifies prime numbers.
