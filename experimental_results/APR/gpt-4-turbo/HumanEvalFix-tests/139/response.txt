```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False
```

For the `special_factorial` function, here is the corrected version:

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    from math import factorial
    special_fact = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        special_fact *= factorial(i)
    return special_fact
```

This corrected version uses the `factorial` function from Python's `math` module to compute the factorial of each number from 1 to `n`, and multiplies these values together to compute the Brazilian factorial as described.
