Here are the fixed versions of the provided Python functions, `has_close_elements` and `can_arrange`, with the necessary corrections and improvements:

### Fixed `has_close_elements` Function
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)  # Use absolute value to measure distance correctly
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Fixed `can_arrange` Function
```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    ind = -1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            ind = i  # Update ind to the current index where the condition is met
    return ind
```

These fixes address the issues in the original code:
- In `has_close_elements`, the distance calculation now correctly uses the absolute value to ensure that the comparison is based on the actual numerical distance between two numbers.
- In `can_arrange`, the loop now correctly updates the index `ind` only when the current element is less than the previous one, and it no longer erroneously decrements `ind` after each iteration.
