The bug in the `has_close_elements` function is that it is not taking the absolute value of the distance between the elements. This means that if the distance is negative, it will not be considered as a close element.

The bug in the `exchange` function is that it is not correctly counting the number of odd and even numbers in the lists. It is not considering the elements in the second list, and it is not correctly updating the counts for odd and even numbers.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    lst1_odd = sum(i % 2 for i in lst1)
    lst2_even = sum(i % 2 == 0 for i in lst2)
    if lst1_odd <= lst2_even:
        return "YES"
    return "NO"
```

In the `exchange` function, I have corrected the counting of odd and even numbers in the lists. I have also changed the condition in the `if` statement to check if the number of odd numbers in `lst1` is less than or equal to the number of even numbers in `lst2`. This is because we want to exchange elements from `lst2` to `lst1`, so we need to make sure that `lst1` has enough even numbers to accommodate the elements from `lst2`.
