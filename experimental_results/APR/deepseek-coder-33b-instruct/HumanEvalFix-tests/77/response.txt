The bug in the `iscube` function is that it is comparing a floating point number with an integer. This will always return False. The `round` function is used to round the result of the cube root to the nearest integer, but it returns a float. The `int` function is used to convert the result to an integer, but it does not round the number, it just removes the decimal part. The `round` function is not needed here.

Fixed Code:
```python
def iscube(a):
    a = abs(a)
    return int(a ** (1. / 3)) ** 3 == a
```

The bug in the `has_close_elements` function is that it is not taking the absolute value of the distance between two numbers. This means that if the first number is larger than the second, the distance will be negative, and the function will incorrectly return False.

Fixed Code:
```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False
```
