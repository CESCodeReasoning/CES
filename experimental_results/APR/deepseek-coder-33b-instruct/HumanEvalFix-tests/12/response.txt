The bug in the `has_close_elements` function is that it is calculating the distance as `elem - elem2`, which is not the correct way to calculate the absolute distance between two numbers. The correct way to calculate the absolute distance is to use the `abs` function.

The bug in the `longest` function is that it is returning the first string that is longer than the maximum length, not the longest string. The `max` function should be used to find the maximum length, and then the first string that has this length should be returned.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
from typing import List, Optional

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None

    maxlen = max(len(x) for x in strings)
    for s in strings:
        if len(s) == maxlen:
            return s
```
