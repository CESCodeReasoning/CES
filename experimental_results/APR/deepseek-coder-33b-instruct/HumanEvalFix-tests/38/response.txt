The bug in `has_close_elements` function is that it is calculating the distance as `elem - elem2` which is not correct. The distance should be the absolute difference between the two elements, so it should be `abs(elem - elem2)`.

The bug in `decode_cyclic` function is that it is calling `encode_cyclic` function which is not correct. It should be the reverse of `encode_cyclic` function.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
    """
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)

def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    returns decoded string by reversing the cycling groups of three characters.
    """
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # reverse elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)
```

The `decode_cyclic` function now correctly reverses the cycling of groups of three characters.
