The bug in the `has_close_elements` function is that it is calculating the distance as `elem - elem2` instead of `abs(elem - elem2)`. The `abs` function is used to get the absolute value of the distance, which ensures that the distance is always positive.

The bug in the `tri` function is that it is not correctly calculating the Tribonacci sequence. The sequence should be calculated based on the recurrence relation provided in the problem statement. The function should be corrected to use the correct recurrence relation.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

def tri(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [1]
    elif n == 1:
        return [1, 3]
    else:
        my_tri = [1, 3]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)
            else:
                my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + my_tri[i - 3] + i + (i + 3) / 2)
        return my_tri
```

The `tri` function now correctly calculates the Tribonacci sequence based on the recurrence relation provided in the problem statement.
