The bug in the `has_close_elements` function is that it is checking if the distance between two numbers is less than the threshold, but it should check if the absolute value of the distance is less than the threshold.

The bug in the `is_palindrome` function is that it is checking if the first character of the string is equal to the last character, the second character is equal to the second last character, and so on. This is not a correct way to check if a string is a palindrome. A correct way to check if a string is a palindrome is to check if the first half of the string is equal to the reverse of the second half of the string.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    return text == text[::-1]
```
