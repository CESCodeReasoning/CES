The bug in the `has_close_elements` function is that it is calculating the distance between two numbers as `elem - elem2`, but it should be `abs(elem - elem2)` to get the absolute distance.

The bug in the `select_words` function is that it is counting the number of vowels in a word, but it should be counting the number of consonants.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

def select_words(s, n):
    result = []
    for word in s.split():
        n_consonants = 0
        for i in range(0, len(word)):
            if word[i].lower() not in ["a","e","i","o","u"]:
                n_consonants += 1 
        if n_consonants == n:
            result.append(word)
    return result
```
