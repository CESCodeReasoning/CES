The fixed code for `has_close_elements` is already provided in the question. The function is correct and does not need any changes.

The bug in `parse_music` is that it does not handle the case where the input string contains a note that is not in the `note_map` dictionary. This can be fixed by adding a default value to the dictionary for keys that are not in the dictionary.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    note_map = {'o': 3, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}
    return [note_map.get(x, 0) for x in music_string.split(' ') if x]
```

In this fixed code, `note_map.get(x, 0)` will return the value for the key `x` in `note_map` if it exists, and `0` if it does not. This will prevent a `KeyError` from being raised when the input string contains a note that is not in the `note_map` dictionary.
