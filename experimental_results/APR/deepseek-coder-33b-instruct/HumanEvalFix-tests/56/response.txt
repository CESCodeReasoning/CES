The bug in the `has_close_elements` function is that it is not taking the absolute value of the difference between two numbers. This means that if the first number is larger than the second, the difference will be negative, and the function will incorrectly return True.

The bug in the `correct_bracketing` function is that it is not checking if the depth is less than 0. If there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, the depth will become negative, but the function will not return False.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets:
        if b == ">":
            depth += 1
        else:
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0:
            return False
    return depth == 0
```
