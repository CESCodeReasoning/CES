Buggy Code:
```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    l = list(l)
    return l
```

Fixed Code:
```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    sorted_l = sorted(l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0)
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            l[i] = sorted_l.pop(0)
    return l
```

Explanation:
The buggy code is not sorting the elements at the indices divisible by three. It is just copying the list. The fixed code sorts the elements at the indices divisible by three and replaces the elements at those indices in the original list.
