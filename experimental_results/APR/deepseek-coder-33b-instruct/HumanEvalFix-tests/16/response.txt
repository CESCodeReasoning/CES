Buggy Code:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len(set(string))
```

The bug in the code is that it does not consider the case of the characters when counting distinct characters. It treats 'a' and 'A' as the same character.

Fixed Code:
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len(set(string.lower()))
```

In the fixed code, we convert the string to lowercase before creating the set of characters. This ensures that 'a' and 'A' are counted as the same character.
