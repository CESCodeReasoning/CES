The bug in the `has_close_elements` function is that it is not taking the absolute value of the distance between two elements. This means that if the distance is negative, it will not be considered as a collision.

The bug in the `car_race_collision` function is that it is returning the cube of the input, which is not the correct formula for the number of collisions in a car race. In a car race, the number of collisions is equal to the number of cars, not the cube of the number of cars.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False
```

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n
```

The `car_race_collision` function now correctly returns the number of cars, which is the number of collisions in a car race.
