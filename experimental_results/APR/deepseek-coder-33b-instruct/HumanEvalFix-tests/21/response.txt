The fixed code for `rescale_to_unit` is:

```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    min_number = min(numbers)
    max_number = max(numbers)
    range_numbers = max_number - min_number
    return [(x - min_number) / range_numbers for x in numbers]
```

The bug in the original code was that it was dividing by the sum of the minimum and maximum numbers instead of the range of the numbers. The range of the numbers is the difference between the maximum and minimum numbers.
