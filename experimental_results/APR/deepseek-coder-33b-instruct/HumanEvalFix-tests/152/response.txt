The bug in the `has_close_elements` function is that it calculates the distance between two elements as `elem - elem2`, but it should be `abs(elem - elem2)` to get the absolute difference.

The bug in the `compare` function is that it calculates the difference as `abs(x-y)+abs(y-x)`, but it should be `abs(x-y)`.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

def compare(game,guess):
    return [abs(x-y) for x,y in zip(game,guess)]
```
