Buggy Code:
```python
def add(lst):
    return sum([lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 1) if lst[i]%2 == 0])
```

Fixed Code:
```python
def add(lst):
    return sum([lst[i] for i in range(len(lst)) if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0])
```

The bug in the original code was that it was starting the range from 1, which means it was skipping the first element of the list. It should start from 0. Also, it was using 1 as the step, which is unnecessary. The step should be 1 by default. The fixed code now correctly starts from 0 and uses the default step of 1.
