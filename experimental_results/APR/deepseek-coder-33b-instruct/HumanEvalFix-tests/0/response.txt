The bug in the original code is that it calculates the distance between two numbers as `elem - elem2`, which will give a negative distance if `elem` is less than `elem2`. However, the problem statement asks for "closer to each other" not "further apart", so we should use the absolute value of the difference to ensure we always get a positive distance.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False
```

This function now correctly calculates the absolute difference between two numbers, and correctly returns `True` if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold.
