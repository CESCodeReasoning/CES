The bug in the `has_close_elements` function is that it is not taking the absolute value of the distance between two numbers. This means that if the distance is negative, it will not be considered as close.

The bug in the `even_odd_palindrome` function is that it is not considering the number `n` in the range. The range should be from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    def is_palindrome(n):
        return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]

    even_palindrome_count = 0
    odd_palindrome_count = 0

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i%2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i):
                odd_palindrome_count += 1
        elif i%2 == 0 and is_palindrome(i):
            even_palindrome_count += 1
    return (even_palindrome_count, odd_palindrome_count)
```
