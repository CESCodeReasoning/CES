Buggy Code:
```python
def unique(l: list):
    return sorted(l)
```

Fixed Code:
```python
def unique(l: list):
    return sorted(set(l))
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original code is that it does not remove duplicates from the list before sorting it. The `set` function is used to remove duplicates from the list.
