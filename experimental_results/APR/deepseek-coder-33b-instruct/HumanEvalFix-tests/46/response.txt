Buggy Code:
```python
def fib4(n: int):
    results = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    if n < 4:
        return results[n]

    for _ in range(4, n + 1):
        results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4])
        results.pop(0)

    return results[-2]
```

Fixed Code:
```python
def fib4(n: int):
    results = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    if n < 4:
        return results[n]

    for _ in range(4, n + 1):
        results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4])
        results.pop(0)

    return results[-1]
```

The bug in the original code was that it was returning `results[-2]` instead of `results[-1]`. This is because the `results` list is being popped from the front, so the last element is actually at `results[-1]`, not `results[-2]`.
