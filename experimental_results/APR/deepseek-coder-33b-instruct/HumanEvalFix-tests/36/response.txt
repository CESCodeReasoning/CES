The bug in the `has_close_elements` function is that it is checking if the distance between two numbers is less than the threshold, but it should be checking if the absolute value of the distance is less than the threshold.

The bug in the `fizz_buzz` function is that it is checking if a number is divisible by 11 and 13, but it should be checking if a number is divisible by either 11 or 13.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    ns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            ns.append(i)
    s = ''.join(list(map(str, ns)))
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        ans += (c == '7')
    return ans
```
