The bug in the `has_close_elements` function is that it is checking if the distance between two elements is less than the threshold, but it should be checking if the absolute value of the distance is less than the threshold.

The bug in the `prime_length` function is that it is checking if the length of the string is divisible by any number from 3 to the length of the string, but it should be checking if the length of the string is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the length of the string.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

def prime_length(string):
    l = len(string)
    if l == 0 or l == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, math.isqrt(l) + 1):
        if l % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

The `math.isqrt(l) + 1` is used instead of `l` to optimize the function. It is because a larger factor of the number must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.
