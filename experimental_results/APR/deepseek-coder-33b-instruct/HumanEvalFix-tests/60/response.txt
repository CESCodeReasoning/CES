The bug in the `has_close_elements` function is that it is calculating the distance as `elem - elem2`, which can give a negative distance if `elem2` is greater than `elem`. This is not what we want, as we want the distance to be always positive. We should use `abs(elem - elem2)` to get the absolute value of the distance, which will always be positive.

The bug in the `sum_to_n` function is that it is using `range(n)`, which does not include `n` in the sum. We should use `range(n+1)` to include `n` in the sum.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False
```

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    return sum(range(n+1))
```

These functions now satisfy the natural language specifications and pass the provided tests.
