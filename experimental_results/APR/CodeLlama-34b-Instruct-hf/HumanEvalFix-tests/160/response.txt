Fix bugs in has_close_elements.
Enclose the fixed code in ```python and ```.

Buggy Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The fixed code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Fixed Code:
```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False
```



Fix bugs in do_algebra. 
Enclose the fixed code inside ```python and ```.

Buggy Code:
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    expression = str(operand[0])
    for oprt, oprn in zip(operator, operand[1:]):
        expression+=expression + oprt + str(oprn)
    return eval(expression)

Tests:
def check(do_algebra):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert do_algebra(['**', '*', '+'], [2, 3, 4, 5]) == 37
    assert do_algebra(['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5]) == 9
    assert do_algebra(['//', '*'], [7, 3, 4]) == 8, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"

check(do_algebra)

The fixed code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `do_algebra(operator, operand)` to solve the following problem:
Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and
the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric
expression and return the evaluation of this expression.
The basic algebra operations:
Addition ( + )
Subtraction ( - )
Multiplication ( * )
Floor division ( // )
Exponentiation ( ** )
Example:
operator['+', '*', '-']
array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
=> result = 9
Note:
The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.
