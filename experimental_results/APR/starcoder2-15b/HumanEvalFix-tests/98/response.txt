Fix bugs in has_close_elements.
Enclose the fixed code in ```python and ```.

Buggy Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx!= idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The fixed code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Fixed Code:
```python
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx!= idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False
```


    
Fix bugs in count_upper.    
Enclose the fixed code inside ```python and ```.

Buggy Code:
def count_upper(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(0,len(s),2):
        if s[i] in "AEIOU":
            count += 2
    return count

Tests:
def check(count_upper):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert count_upper('aBCdEf')  == 1
    assert count_upper('abcdefg') == 0
    assert count_upper('dBBE') == 0
    assert count_upper('B')  == 0
    assert count_upper('U')  == 1
    assert count_upper('') == 0
    assert count_upper('EEEE') == 2

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True

check(count_upper)

The fixed code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `count_upper(s)` to solve the following problem:
Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
For example:
count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
count_upper('dBBE') returns 0

    for i in range(0,len(s),2):

            count += 1
    return count
