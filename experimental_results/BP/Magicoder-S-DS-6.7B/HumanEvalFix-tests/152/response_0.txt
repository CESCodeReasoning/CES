Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def compare(game,guess):
    return [abs(x-y) for x,y in zip(game,guess)]

Tests:
def check(compare):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2])==[0,0,0,0,3,3], "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2])==[4,4,1,0,0,6]
    # Check some simple cases
    assert compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2])==[0,0,0,0,3,3], "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert compare([0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0])==[0,0,0,0,0,0], "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert compare([1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3])==[2,4,6], "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert compare([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4])==[2,0,0,1], "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"

check(compare)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `compare(game,guess)` to solve the following problem:
I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
definitely worth noting down and comparing.
Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match.
Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
example:
compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
