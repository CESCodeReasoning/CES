Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def sort_array(arr):
    return sorted(sorted(arr), key=lambda x: arr.count('1'))

Tests:
def check(sort_array):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert sort_array([1,5,2,3,4]) == [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
    assert sort_array([-2,-3,-4,-5,-6]) == [-4, -2, -6, -5, -3]
    assert sort_array([1,0,2,3,4]) == [0, 1, 2, 4, 3]
    assert sort_array([]) == []
    assert sort_array([2,5,77,4,5,3,5,7,2,3,4]) == [2, 2, 4, 4, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7, 77]
    assert sort_array([3,6,44,12,32,5]) == [32, 3, 5, 6, 12, 44]
    assert sort_array([2,4,8,16,32]) == [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
    assert sort_array([2,4,8,16,32]) == [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"

check(sort_array)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `sort_array(arr)` to solve the following problem:
In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to
number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.
For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.
It must be implemented like this:

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def find_missing(arr):
    return [x for x in range(arr[0], arr[-1]+1) if x not in arr]

Tests:
def check(find_missing):
    assert find_missing([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10]) == [5, 8, 9]
    assert find_missing([5, 1, 4, 2]) == [3]
    assert find_missing([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10]) == [5, 8, 9]
    assert find_missing([5, 1, 4, 2]) == [3]
    assert find_missing([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10]) == [5, 8, 9]
    assert find_missing([5, 1, 4, 2]) == [3]
    assert find_missing([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10]) == [5, 8, 9]
    assert find_missing([5, 1, 4, 2]) == [3]
    assert find_missing([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10]) == [5, 8, 9]
    assert find_missing([5, 1, 4, 2]) == [3]

check(find_missing)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `find_missing(arr)` to solve the following problem:
Given a list of unsorted numbers, write a function that returns a list of numbers
that are in the range of the given list but not in the list.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```
