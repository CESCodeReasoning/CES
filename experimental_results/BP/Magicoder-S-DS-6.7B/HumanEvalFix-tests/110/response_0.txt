Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    odd = 0
    even = 0
    for i in lst1:
        if i%2 == 1:
            odd += 1
    for i in lst2:
        if i%2 == 0:
            even += 1
    if even >= odd:
        return "YES"
    return "NO"
            

Tests:
def check(exchange):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) == "YES"
    assert exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) == "NO"
    assert exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 1, 4, 3]) == "YES" 
    assert exchange([5, 7, 3], [2, 6, 4]) == "YES"
    assert exchange([5, 7, 3], [2, 6, 3]) == "NO" 
    assert exchange([3, 2, 6, 1, 8, 9], [3, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1]) == "NO"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert exchange([100, 200], [200, 200]) == "YES"

check(exchange)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `exchange(lst1, lst2)` to solve the following problem:
In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
Otherwise, return "NO".
For example:
exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
