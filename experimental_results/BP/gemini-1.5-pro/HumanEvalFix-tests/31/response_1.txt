The logic for checking prime numbers is incorrect in the given code. Let's break down why:

**The Issue:**

* **Incorrect Loop Range:** The code iterates from `1` to `n - 1`. To determine primality, you only need to check for divisors up to the square root of `n`. If a number `n` has a divisor greater than its square root, it must also have a divisor smaller than its square root. 

**Example:**

Let's take the number 12. The current code would check divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.  However, you only need to check: 1, 2, 3 (since the square root of 12 is approximately 3.46).

**Why this matters:**

The current code leads to unnecessary iterations, making it inefficient, especially for larger numbers.

**Corrected Approach:**

A more efficient approach would be:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n: 
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```
