Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def f(n):
    ret = []
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if i%2 == 0:
            x = 1
            for j in range(1,i+1): x *= i
            ret += [x]
        else:
            x = 0
            for j in range(1,i+1): x += j
            ret += [x]
    return ret

Tests:
def check(f):

    assert f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
    assert f(7) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28]
    assert f(1) == [1]
    assert f(3) == [1, 2, 6]

check(f)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `f(n)` to solve the following problem:
Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
i starts from 1.
the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
Example:
f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:

        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return f(n-1) + f(n-2)

Tests:
def check(f):
    assert f(0) == 0
    assert f(1) == 1
    assert f(2) == 1
    assert f(3) == 2
    assert f(4) == 3

    assert f(6) == 8
    assert f(7) == 13
    assert f(8) == 21
    assert f(9) == 34
    assert f(10) == 55

check(f)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `f(n)` to solve the following problem:
Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
and returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence.
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.
Example:
f(0) == 0
f(1) == 1
f(2) == 1
f(3) == 2
f(4) == 3
f(5) == 5
f(6) == 8

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:

No
