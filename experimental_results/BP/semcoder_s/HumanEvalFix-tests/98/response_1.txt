Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def count_upper(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(0,len(s),2):
        if s[i] in "AEIOU":
            count += 2
    return count

Tests:
def check(count_upper):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert count_upper('aBCdEf')  == 1
    assert count_upper('abcdefg') == 0
    assert count_upper('dBBE') == 0
    assert count_upper('B')  == 0
    assert count_upper('U')  == 1
    assert count_upper('') == 0
    assert count_upper('EEEE') == 2

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True

check(count_upper)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `count_upper(s)` to solve the following problem:
Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
For example:
count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
count_upper('dBBE') returns 0

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
```
