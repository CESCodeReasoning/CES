Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    def is_prime(num):
        if num == 1 or num == 0:
            return False
        if num == 2:
            return True
        for i in range(2, num):
            if num%i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    l = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])
    r = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])
    length = r - l
    if length > 0:
        return "YES"
    return "NO"

Tests:
def check(intersection):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) == "NO"
    assert intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) == "NO"
    assert intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) == "YES"
    assert intersection((-2, 2), (-4, 0)) == "YES"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert intersection((-11, 2), (-1, -1)) == "NO"
    assert intersection((1, 2), (3, 5)) == "NO"
    assert intersection((1, 2), (1, 2)) == "NO"
    assert intersection((-2, -2), (-3, -2)) == "NO"

check(intersection)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `intersection(interval1, interval2)` to solve the following problem:
You are given two intervals,
where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).
The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)
includes both start and end.
For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two
intervals is a prime number.
Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
which its length is 1, which not a prime number.
If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES",
otherwise, return "NO".
If the two intervals don't intersect, return "NO".
[input/output] samples:
intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
```
