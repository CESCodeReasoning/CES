Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    expression = str(operand[0])
    for oprt, oprn in zip(operator, operand[1:]):
        expression+=expression + oprt + str(oprn)
    return eval(expression)

Tests:
def check(do_algebra):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert do_algebra(['**', '*', '+'], [2, 3, 4, 5]) == 37
    assert do_algebra(['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5]) == 9
    assert do_algebra(['//', '*'], [7, 3, 4]) == 8, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"

check(do_algebra)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `do_algebra(operator, operand)` to solve the following problem:
Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and
the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric
expression and return the evaluation of this expression.
The basic algebra operations:
Addition ( + )
Subtraction ( - )
Multiplication ( * )
Floor division ( // )
Exponentiation ( ** )
Example:
operator['+', '*', '-']
array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
=> result = 9
Note:
The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def find_duplicates(numbers):
    duplicates = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] == numbers[j]:
                duplicates.append(numbers[i])
    return duplicates

Tests:
def check(find_duplicates):
    assert find_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [2, 3, 4, 5]
    assert find_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == []
    assert find_duplicates([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) == [1]
    assert find_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10]) == [10]
    assert find_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10]) == [10]

check(find_duplicates)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `find_duplicates(numbers)` to solve the following problem:
Given a list of numbers, find all the duplicate numbers in the list and return them in a new list.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```
