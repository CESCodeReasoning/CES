Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return a * h / 0.5

Tests:
def check(triangle_area):
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5
    assert triangle_area(2, 2) == 2.0
    assert triangle_area(10, 8) == 40.0

check(triangle_area)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `triangle_area(a, h)` to solve the following problem:
Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    return a + b

Tests:
def check(calculate_sum):
    assert calculate_sum(5, 3) == 8
    assert calculate_sum(2, 2) == 4
    assert calculate_sum(10, 8) == 18

check(calculate_sum)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `calculate_sum(a, b)` to solve the following problem:
Given two numbers return their sum.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def calculate_average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

Tests:
def check(calculate_average):
    assert calculate_average([5, 3]) == 4.0
    assert calculate_average([2, 2]) == 2.0
    assert calculate_average([10, 8]) == 9.0

check(calculate_average)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `calculate_average(numbers)` to solve the following problem:
Given a list of numbers return their average.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
