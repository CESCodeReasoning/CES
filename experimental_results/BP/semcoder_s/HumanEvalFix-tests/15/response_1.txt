Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join([str(x) for x in range(n)])

Tests:
def check(string_sequence):
    assert string_sequence(0) == '0'
    assert string_sequence(3) == '0 1 2 3'
    assert string_sequence(10) == '0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10'

check(string_sequence)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `string_sequence(n: int) -> str` to solve the following problem:
Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def count_even_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    count = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

Tests:
def check(count_even_numbers):
    assert count_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == 3
    assert count_even_numbers([1, 3, 5, 7]) == 0
    assert count_even_numbers([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) == 5
    assert count_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 5

check(count_even_numbers)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `count_even_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> int` to solve the following problem:
Count the number of even integers in the given list of numbers.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List

    max_num = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max_num:
            max_num = num
    return max_num

Tests:
def check(find_max_element):
    assert find_max_element([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == 6
    assert find_max_element([1, 3, 5, 7]) == 7
