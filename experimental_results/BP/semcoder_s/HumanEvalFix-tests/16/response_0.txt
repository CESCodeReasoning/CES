Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len(set(string.lower()))

Tests:
def check(count_distinct_characters):
    assert count_distinct_characters('') == 0
    assert count_distinct_characters('abcde') == 5
    assert count_distinct_characters('abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE') == 5
    assert count_distinct_characters('aaaaAAAAaaaa') == 1
    assert count_distinct_characters('Jerry jERRY JeRRRY') == 5

check(count_distinct_characters)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int` to solve the following problem:
Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def find_common_elements(list1: List[int], list2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    common_elements = []
    for elem in list1:
        if elem in list2:
            common_elements.append(elem)
    return common_elements

Tests:
def check(find_common_elements):
    assert find_common_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) == [3, 4, 5]
    assert find_common_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == []
    assert find_common_elements([1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) == [1]
    assert find_common_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5]
    assert find_common_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

check(find_common_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `find_common_elements(list1: List[int], list2: List[int]) -> List[int]` to solve the following problem:
Given two lists, find out which elements they have in common and return them as a new list.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
```
