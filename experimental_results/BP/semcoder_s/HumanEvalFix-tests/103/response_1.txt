Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if m < n:
        return -1
    summation = 0
    for i in range(n, m+1):
        summation += i
    return bin(round(summation/(m - n)))

Tests:
def check(rounded_avg):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert rounded_avg(1, 5) == "0b11"
    assert rounded_avg(7, 13) == "0b1010"
    assert rounded_avg(964,977) == "0b1111001010"
    assert rounded_avg(996,997) == "0b1111100100"
    assert rounded_avg(560,851) == "0b1011000010"
    assert rounded_avg(185,546) == "0b101101110"
    assert rounded_avg(362,496) == "0b110101101"
    assert rounded_avg(350,902) == "0b1001110010"
    assert rounded_avg(197,233) == "0b11010111"


    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert rounded_avg(7, 5) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(5, 1) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(5, 5) == "0b101"

check(rounded_avg)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `rounded_avg(n, m)` to solve the following problem:
You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
average of the integers from n through m (including n and m).
Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
If n is greater than m, return -1.
Example:
rounded_avg(1, 5) => "0b11"
rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1
rounded_avg(10, 20) => "0b1111"
rounded_avg(20, 33) => "0b11010"

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

Tests:
def check(is_prime):
    assert is_prime(2) == True
    assert is_prime(3) == True
    assert is_prime(4) == False
    assert is_prime(5) == True
    assert is_prime(6) == False
    assert is_prime(7) == True
    assert is_prime(8) == False
    assert is_prime(9) == False
    assert is_prime(10) == False
    assert is_prime(11) == True
    assert is_prime(12) == False
    assert is_prime(13) == True
    assert is_prime(14) == False
    assert is_prime(15) == False
    assert is_prime(16) == False
    assert is_prime(17) == True
    assert is_prime(18) == False
    assert is_prime(19) == True
    assert is_prime(20) == False

check(is_prime)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `is_prime(n)` to solve the following problem:
Check if a given number n is a prime number.
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
