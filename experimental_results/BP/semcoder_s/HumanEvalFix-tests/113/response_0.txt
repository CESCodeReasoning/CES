Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def odd_count(lst):
    res = []
    for arr in lst:
        n = sum(int(d)%2==1 for d in arr)
        res.append("the number of odd elements " + str(n) + "n the str"+ str(n) +"ng "+ str(n) +" of the "+ str(n) +"nput.")
    return res

Tests:
def check(odd_count):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert odd_count(['1234567']) == ["the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."], "Test 1"
    assert odd_count(['3',"11111111"]) == ["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.", "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."], "Test 2"
    assert odd_count(['271', '137', '314']) == [
        'the number of odd elements 2n the str2ng 2 of the 2nput.',
        'the number of odd elements 3n the str3ng 3 of the 3nput.',
        'the number of odd elements 2n the str2ng 2 of the 2nput.'
    ]

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"

check(odd_count)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `odd_count(lst)` to solve the following problem:
Given a list of strings, where each string consists of only digits, return a list.
Each element i of the output should be "the number of odd elements in the
string i of the input." where all the i's should be replaced by the number
of odd digits in the i'th string of the input.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```

Code:

    count = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 != 0:
            count += 1
    return count

Tests:
def check(count_odd_numbers):
    assert count_odd_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == 3
    assert count_odd_numbers([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) == 0
    assert count_odd_numbers([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]) == 7

    assert count_odd_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 5

check(count_odd_numbers)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `count_odd_numbers(numbers)` to solve the following problem:
Count the number of odd numbers in the given list of integers and return the count.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".

No
