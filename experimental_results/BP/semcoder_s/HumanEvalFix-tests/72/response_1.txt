Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def will_it_fly(q,w):
    if sum(q) > w:
        return False

    i, j = 0, len(q)-1
    while i<j:
        if q[i] == q[j]:
            return False
        i+=1
        j-=1
    return True

Tests:
def check(will_it_fly):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) is True
    assert will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) is False
    assert will_it_fly([3], 5) is True
    assert will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) is False


    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert will_it_fly([1, 2, 3], 6) is False
    assert will_it_fly([5], 5) is True

check(will_it_fly)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `will_it_fly(q,w)` to solve the following problem:
Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.
Example:
will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) ➞ False
# 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.
will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) ➞ False
# it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.
will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) ➞ True
# 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
will_it_fly([3], 5) ➞ True
# 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
