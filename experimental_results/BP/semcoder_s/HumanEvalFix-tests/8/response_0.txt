Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List, Tuple


def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    sum_value = 0
    prod_value = 1

    for n in numbers:
        sum_value += n
        prod_value *= n
    return sum_value, prod_value

Tests:
def check(sum_product):
    assert sum_product([]) == (0, 1)
    assert sum_product([1, 1, 1]) == (3, 1)
    assert sum_product([100, 0]) == (100, 0)
    assert sum_product([3, 5, 7]) == (3 + 5 + 7, 3 * 5 * 7)
    assert sum_product([10]) == (10, 10)

check(sum_product)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]` to solve the following problem:
For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List


def count_even_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    count = 0
    for n in numbers:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

Tests:
def check(count_even_numbers):
    assert count_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == 3
    assert count_even_numbers([1, 3, 5, 7]) == 0
    assert count_even_numbers([2, 4, 6, 8]) == 4
    assert count_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 5
    assert count_even_numbers([]) == 0

check(count_even_numbers)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `count_even_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> int` to solve the following problem:
Count the number of even integers in a given list of integers.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List


def find_max(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    max_value = numbers[0]
    for n in numbers:
        if n > max_value:
            max_value = n
    return max_value

Tests:
def check(find_max):
    assert find_max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == 6
    assert find_max([1, 3, 5, 7]) == 7
