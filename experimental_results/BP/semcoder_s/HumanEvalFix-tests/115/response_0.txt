Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    return sum([math.ceil(sum(arr)/capacity) for arr in grid])

Tests:
def check(max_fill):


    # Check some simple cases
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1) == 6, "Error"
    assert max_fill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2) == 5, "Error"
    assert max_fill([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5) == 0, "Error"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"
    assert max_fill([[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], 2) == 4, "Error"
    assert max_fill([[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], 9) == 2, "Error"

check(max_fill)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math` to solve the following problem:
You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it,
and all buckets have the same capacity.
Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.
Example 1:
Input:
grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]
bucket_capacity : 1
Output: 6
Example 2:
Input:
grid : [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
bucket_capacity : 2
Output: 5
Example 3:
Input:
grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
bucket_capacity : 5
Output: 0
Constraints:
* all wells have the same length
* 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2
* 1 <= grid[:,1].length <= 10^2
* grid[i][j] -> 0 | 1
* 1 <= capacity <= 10

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```
