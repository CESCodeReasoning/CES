Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def double_the_difference(lst):
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i%2!=0 and "." not in str(i)])

Tests:
def check(double_the_difference):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert double_the_difference([]) == 0 , "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert double_the_difference([5, 4]) == 25 , "This prints if this assert fails 2 (good for debugging!)"
    assert double_the_difference([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]) == 0 , "This prints if this assert fails 3 (good for debugging!)"
    assert double_the_difference([-10, -20, -30]) == 0 , "This prints if this assert fails 4 (good for debugging!)"


    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert double_the_difference([-1, -2, 8]) == 0, "This prints if this assert fails 5 (also good for debugging!)"
    assert double_the_difference([0.2, 3, 5]) == 34, "This prints if this assert fails 6 (also good for debugging!)"
    lst = list(range(-99, 100, 2))
    odd_sum = sum([i**2 for i in lst if i%2!=0 and i > 0])
    assert double_the_difference(lst) == odd_sum , "This prints if this assert fails 7 (good for debugging!)"

check(double_the_difference)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `double_the_difference(lst)` to solve the following problem:
Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
double_the_difference([0]) == 0
If the input list is empty, return 0.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No

Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def count_vowels(s):
    return sum([1 for c in s if c in "aeiouAEIOU"])

Tests:
def check(count_vowels):
    assert count_vowels("Hello, World!") == 3
    assert count_vowels("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.") == 9
    assert count_vowels("I love programming in Python.") == 8
    assert count_vowels("") == 0
    assert count_vowels("aeiouAEIOU") == 10

check(count_vowels)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `count_vowels(s)` to solve the following problem:
Given a string, return the number of vowels in the string.
Vowels are the letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'.
count_vowels("Hello, World!") == 3
count_vowels("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.") == 9
count_vowels("I love programming in Python.") == 8
count_vowels("") == 0
count_vowels("aeiouAEIOU") == 10

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
