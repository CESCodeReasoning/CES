Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    new_lst = []
    for word in sentence.split():
        flg = 0
        for i in range(2, len(word)):
            if len(word)%i == 0:
                flg = 1
        if flg == 0 or len(word) == 2:
            new_lst.append(word)
    return " ".join(new_lst)

Tests:
def check(words_in_sentence):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert words_in_sentence("This is a test") == "is"
    assert words_in_sentence("lets go for swimming") == "go for"
    assert words_in_sentence("there is no place available here") == "there is no place"
    assert words_in_sentence("Hi I am Hussein") == "Hi am Hussein"
    assert words_in_sentence("go for it") == "go for it"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert words_in_sentence("here") == ""
    assert words_in_sentence("here is") == "is"

check(words_in_sentence)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `words_in_sentence(sentence)` to solve the following problem:
You are given a string representing a sentence,
the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
whose lengths are prime numbers,
the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.
Example 1:
Input: sentence = "This is a test"
Output: "is"
Example 2:
Input: sentence = "lets go for swimming"
Output: "go for"
Constraints:
* 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
* sentence contains only letters

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```

        return True

        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:

def prime_words(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()

check(prime_words)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `prime_words(sentence)` to solve the following problem:

whose lengths are prime numbers,
