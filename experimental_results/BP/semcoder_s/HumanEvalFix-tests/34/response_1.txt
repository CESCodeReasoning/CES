Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def unique(l: list):
    return sorted(l)

Tests:
def check(unique):
    assert unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]

check(unique)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `unique(l: list)` to solve the following problem:
Return sorted unique elements in a list

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

Tests:
def check(is_palindrome):
    assert is_palindrome("racecar") == True
    assert is_palindrome("python") == False
    assert is_palindrome("a") == True
    assert is_palindrome("") == True

check(is_palindrome)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if a given string is a palindrome.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def sum_of_elements(l: list) -> int:
    return sum(l)

Tests:
def check(sum_of_elements):
    assert sum_of_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 15
    assert sum_of_elements([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]) == 150
    assert sum_of_elements([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]) == -15

check(sum_of_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `sum_of_elements(l: list) -> int` to solve the following problem:
Calculate the sum of all elements in a given list.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
```
