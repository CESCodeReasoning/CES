Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
Yes
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def select_words(s, n):
    result = []
    for word in s.split():
        n_consonants = 0
        for i in range(0, len(word)):
            if word[i].lower() in ["a","e","i","o","u"]:
                n_consonants += 1 
        if n_consonants == n:
            result.append(word)
    return result

Tests:
def check(select_words):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) == ["little"], "First test error: " + str(select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4))      
    assert select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) == ["Mary", "lamb"], "Second test error: " + str(select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3))  
    assert select_words("simple white space", 2) == [], "Third test error: " + str(select_words("simple white space", 2))      
    assert select_words("Hello world", 4) == ["world"], "Fourth test error: " + str(select_words("Hello world", 4))  
    assert select_words("Uncle sam", 3) == ["Uncle"], "Fifth test error: " + str(select_words("Uncle sam", 3))


    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert select_words("", 4) == [], "1st edge test error: " + str(select_words("", 4))
    assert select_words("a b c d e f", 1) == ["b", "c", "d", "f"], "2nd edge test error: " + str(select_words("a b c d e f", 1))

check(select_words)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `select_words(s, n)` to solve the following problem:
Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement
a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly
n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
Examples:
select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
No
```


    
Given the following code, tests and natural language specification, is the code buggy or not?
Code:
def count_vowels(s):
    count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.lower() in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]:
            count += 1
    return count

Tests:
def check(count_vowels):
    assert count_vowels("Hello world") == 3, "First test error: " + str(count_vowels("Hello world"))
    assert count_vowels("The quick brown fox") == 5, "Second test error: " + str(count_vowels("The quick brown fox"))
    assert count_vowels("") == 0, "Third test error: " + str(count_vowels(""))
    assert count_vowels("a e i o u") == 5, "Fourth test error: " + str(count_vowels("a e i o u"))
    assert count_vowels("Aeiou") == 5, "Fifth test error: " + str(count_vowels("Aeiou"))

check(count_vowels)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `count_vowels(s)` to solve the following problem:
Given a string s, you have been tasked to implement a function that returns the
number of vowels in the string s.
Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
Examples:
count_vowels("Hello world") ==> 3
count_vowels("The quick brown fox") ==> 5
count_vowels("") ==> 0
count_vowels("a e i o u") ==> 5
count_vowels("Aeiou") ==> 5

Response with "Yes" or "No". "Yes" menas the code is buggy, "No" means it is not buggy. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:

No
