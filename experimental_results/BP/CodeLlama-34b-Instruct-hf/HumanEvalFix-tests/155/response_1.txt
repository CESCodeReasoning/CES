The code is not buggy. It correctly counts the number of even and odd digits in the input number. The tests cover a variety of cases, including negative numbers, and the function returns the correct results.

The only potential issue with the code is that it only works for integers. If the input is a float or a string that represents a float, the function will raise a `TypeError` because it tries to iterate over the characters of the string using the `for` loop. To fix this, the function could be modified to handle floats and strings that represent floats by converting them to integers before counting the digits.
