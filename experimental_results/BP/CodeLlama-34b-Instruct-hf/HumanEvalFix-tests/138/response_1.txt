The code is buggy because it does not correctly implement the natural language specification. The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` should return `True` if the given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, and `False` otherwise. However, the function returns `True` for all inputs, which is not correct.

For example, `is_equal_to_sum_even(4)` should return `False` because 4 cannot be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. Similarly, `is_equal_to_sum_even(6)` should return `False` because 6 cannot be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

The correct implementation of the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` should check if the given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, and return `True` if it can, and `False` otherwise.
