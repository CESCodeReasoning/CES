The code is not buggy. The function `has_close_elements` correctly checks if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold. The tests provide a good coverage of different cases and the function passes all of them.

The function `cycpattern_check` also correctly checks if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. The tests provide a good coverage of different cases and the function passes all of them.

Therefore, both functions are not buggy and work as intended.
