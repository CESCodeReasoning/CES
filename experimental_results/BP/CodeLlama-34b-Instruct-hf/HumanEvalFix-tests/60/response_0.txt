The code is not buggy. The function `has_close_elements` correctly checks if any two elements in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold. The tests provide a comprehensive set of examples that cover different cases, and the function passes all of them.

The function `sum_to_n` also correctly sums the numbers from 1 to n. The tests provide a set of examples that cover different values of n, and the function passes all of them.

Therefore, both functions are not buggy and satisfy the natural language specifications provided.
