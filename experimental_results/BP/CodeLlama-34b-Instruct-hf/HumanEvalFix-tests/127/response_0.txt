Yes

The code is buggy because it does not correctly handle the case where the two intervals do not intersect. In this case, the function should return "NO", but it will return "YES" because the length of the intersection will be 0, which is a prime number.

To fix this bug, the function should check if the two intervals intersect before checking if the length of the intersection is a prime number. If the intervals do not intersect, the function should return "NO".
