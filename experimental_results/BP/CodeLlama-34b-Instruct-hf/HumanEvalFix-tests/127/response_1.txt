The code is buggy because it does not correctly implement the natural language specification. The function `is_prime` is not used in the `intersection` function, and the `intersection` function only checks if the length of the intersection is greater than 0, which is not the same as checking if the length is a prime number. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the two intervals do not intersect, which is not allowed by the natural language specification.
