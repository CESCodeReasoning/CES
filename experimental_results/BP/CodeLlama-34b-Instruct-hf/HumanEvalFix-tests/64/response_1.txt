The code is not buggy. The function `vowels_count` correctly counts the number of vowels in the input string, following the specification provided. The test cases provided also cover a range of inputs and edge cases, and the function passes all of them.

The only potential issue with the code is that it does not handle non-ASCII characters, such as accented vowels. However, this is not a bug, as the specification does not require the function to handle such cases.
