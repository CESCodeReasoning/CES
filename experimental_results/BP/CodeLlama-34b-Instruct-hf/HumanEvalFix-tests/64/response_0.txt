The code is not buggy. It correctly counts the number of vowels in the input string, following the specification provided. The only potential issue is that it does not handle non-ASCII characters, but this can be easily fixed by using the `unicode` module in Python 2 or the `str` module in Python 3.

The tests provided also cover a wide range of cases, including simple and edge cases, and the function passes all of them. Therefore, the code is not buggy.
