The code is not buggy. The function `has_close_elements` correctly checks if any two elements in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold. The tests provide a comprehensive set of examples that cover different cases, and the function passes all of them.

The function `can_arrange` also correctly returns the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. The tests cover different cases, including edge cases, and the function passes all of them.

Therefore, both functions are not buggy.
