The code is not buggy. The function `has_close_elements` correctly checks if any two elements in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold. The tests provide a good coverage of different cases and the function passes all of them.

The function `add_elements` also correctly solves the problem of summing the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of the array. The tests cover some simple and edge cases, and the function passes all of them.

Therefore, both functions are not buggy.
