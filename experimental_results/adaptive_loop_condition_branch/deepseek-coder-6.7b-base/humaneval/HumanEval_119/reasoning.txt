The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['()(', ')'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `S1` and `S2` are initialized to the concatenation of the first and second elements of the input list.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 2.
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 0.
    -Since val is 0, the function returns True.

Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 0.
    -Since val is 0, the function returns True.

Since the function returns True for both S1 and S2, the function returns 'Yes'.
