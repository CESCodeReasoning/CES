The function compare takes two lists game and guess as input and returns a list of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input [0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0], we need to calculate the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists.
The absolute difference between the first elements of the two lists is 0, the absolute difference between the second elements of the two lists is 0, and so on.
Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input [0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0] is [0,0,0,0,0,0].
