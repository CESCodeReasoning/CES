The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 3 (since ( len(arr) // 2 ) = 4).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 <= i < (len(arr) // 2) ).
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` results in `ans = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which still satisfies ( 0 <= i < (len(arr) // 2) ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` updates `ans` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which now satisfies ( 2 <= i < (len(arr) // 2) ).
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains unchanged.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which now falls outside the previous conditions, falling into the `else` block.
   - The `else` block's action: `ans` remains unchanged.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is now 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6])` is 2.
