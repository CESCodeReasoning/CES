The function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter takes a string txt as input and returns True if the last character of the string is a letter (a-z or A-Z) and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter on the input "apple", we need to check if the last character of the string "apple" is a letter.
The last character of the string "apple" is "e". Since "e" is a letter (a-z or A-Z), the output of executing the function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter on the input "apple" is True.
