The function `search` is called with ( lst = [2, 7, 8, 8, 4, 8, 7, 3, 9, 6, 5, 10, 4, 3, 6, 7, 1, 7, 4, 10, 8, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `frq` is initialized to a list of zeros with length equal to the maximum element in the input list `lst` plus 1.

The variable `ans` is initialized to -1.

Iteration 1:
    -The value at index `i`, which is 1, is less than the length of `frq` (22).
    -The value at index `frq[i]`, which is 0, is less than `i` (1).
    -The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false.
    -The value of `ans` remains -1.
Iteration 2:
    -The value at index `i`, which is 2, is less than the length of `frq` (
