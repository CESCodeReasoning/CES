The function `tri` is called with ( n = 8 ).
The first condition ( n == 0 ) is false, so the function enters the loop.
Iteration 1:
    - The value of i is 2.
    - The condition ( i % 2 == 0 ) is false, so the else block is executed.
    - The value of my_tri[i - 1] is 1, and the value of my_tri[i - 2] is 3.
    - The value of ( i + 3 ) / 2 is 5.
    - The value of my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + ( i + 3 ) / 2 is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.
    - The value of my_tri is now [1, 3, 9].
Iteration 2:
    - The value of i is 3.
    - The condition ( i % 2 == 0 ) is true, so the if block is executed.
    - The value of i / 2 + 1 is 2.
    - The value of my_tri is now [1, 3, 9, 2].
Iteration 3:
    - The value of i is 4.
    - The condition ( i % 2 == 0 ) is false, so the else block is executed.
    - The value of my_tri[i - 1] is 2, and the value of my_tri[i - 2] is 9.
    - The value of ( i + 3 ) / 2 is 6.
    - The value of my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + ( i + 3 ) / 2 is 2 + 9 + 6 = 17.
    - The value of my_tri is now [1, 3, 9, 2, 17].
Iteration 4:
    - The value of i is 5.
    - The condition ( i % 2 == 0 ) is true, so the if block is executed.
    - The value of i / 2 + 1 is 3.
    - The value of my_tri is now [1, 3, 9, 2, 17, 3].
Iteration 5:
    - The value of i is 6.
    - The condition ( i % 2 == 0 ) is false, so the else block is executed.
    - The value of my_tri[i - 1] is 3, and the value of my_tri[i - 2] is 17.
    - The value of ( i + 3 ) / 2 is 7.
    - The value of my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + ( i + 3 ) / 2 is 3 + 17 + 7 = 27.
    - The value of my_tri is now [1, 3, 9, 2, 17, 3, 27].
Iteration 6:
    - The value of i is 7.
    - The condition ( i % 2 == 0 ) is true, so the if block is executed.
    - The value of i / 2 + 1 is 4.
    - The value of my_tri is now [1, 3, 9, 2, 17, 3, 27, 4].
Iteration 7:
    - The value of i is 8.
    - The condition ( i % 2 == 0 ) is false, so the else block is executed.
    - The value of my_tri[i - 1] is 4, and the value of my_tri[i - 2] is 27.
    - The value of ( i + 3 ) / 2 is 9.
    - The value of my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + ( i + 3 ) / 2 is 4 + 27 + 9 = 39.
    - The value of my_tri is now [1, 3, 9, 2, 17, 3, 27, 4, 39].
The loop ends, and the function returns the value of my_tri, which is [1, 3, 9, 2, 17, 3, 27, 4,
