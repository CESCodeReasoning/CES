The function `longest` is called with ( strings = ['x', 'y', 'z'] ).
The condition `not strings` is false, so the function proceeds to the next step.
The `max` function is used to find the maximum length of the strings in the list.
The maximum length is 1, as the longest string in the list has length 1.
The loop iterates over the strings in the list.
The first string 'x' has length 1, which is equal to the maximum length.
Therefore, the function returns 'x'.
