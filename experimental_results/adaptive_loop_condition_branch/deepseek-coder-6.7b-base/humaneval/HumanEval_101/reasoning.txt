The function `words_string` is called with ( s = "Hi, my name is John" ).

The first condition is checked:
    - The condition `not s` is false, so the function proceeds to the next step.

The function initializes an empty list `s_list`.

The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.

Iteration 1:
    - The character 'H' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 2:
    - The character 'i' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 3:
    - The character ',' is equal to ',', so a space is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 4:
    - The character ' ' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 5:
    - The character 'm' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 6:
    - The character 'y' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 7:
    - The character ' ' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 8:
    - The character 'n' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 9:
    - The character 'a' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 10:
    - The character 'm' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 11:
    - The character 'e' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 12:
    - The character ' ' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 13:
    - The character 'i' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 14:
    - The character 's' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 15:
    - The character ' ' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 16:
    - The character 'J' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 17:
    - The character 'o' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 18:
    - The character 'h' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 19:
    - The character 'n' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.

The list `s_list` is joined into a string using the `join` method.

The string is split into words using the `split` method, and the resulting list is returned.

Therefore, the final output of the function `words_string("Hi, my name is John")` is ['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John'].
