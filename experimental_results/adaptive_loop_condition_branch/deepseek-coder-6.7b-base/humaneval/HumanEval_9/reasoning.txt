The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [3,2,3,100,3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None.

Iteration 1:
    -The running_max is None, so it becomes 3.
Iteration 2:
    -The running_max is 3, so it remains 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The running_max is 3, so it remains 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The running_max is 3, so it becomes 100.
Iteration 5:
    -The running_max is 100, so it remains 100.
