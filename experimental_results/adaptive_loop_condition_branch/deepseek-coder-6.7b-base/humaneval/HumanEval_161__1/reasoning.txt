The function `solve` is called with ( s = "ab" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'a' is an alphabet, so the condition `i.isalpha()` is true.
    -The `if` block is executed, and the character 'a' is swapped to 'A'.
    -The `flg` variable is set to 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'b' is an alphabet, so the condition `i.isalpha()` is true.
    -The `if` block is executed, and the character 'b' is swapped to 'B'.
    -The `flg` variable is set to 1.

The `if` block is executed, and the string is reversed.

Therefore, the final output of the function `solve("ab")` is "BA".
