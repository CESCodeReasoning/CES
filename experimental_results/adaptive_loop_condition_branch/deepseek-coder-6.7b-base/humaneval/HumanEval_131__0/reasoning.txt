The function `digits` is called with ( n = 120 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates over the digits of `n` (since ( n = 120 )).
First Iteration (digit = '1')
   - `digit` is '1', which is an odd number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product = product * int_digit` results in `product = 1 * 1 = 1`.
Second Iteration (digit = '2')
   - `digit` is '2', which is an even number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `product` remains unchanged.
Third Iteration (digit = '0')
   - `digit` is '0', which is an even number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `product` remains unchanged.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function checks if `odd_count` is 0.
   - Since `odd_count` is not 0, the function returns the value of `product`, which is now 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digits(120)` is 1.
