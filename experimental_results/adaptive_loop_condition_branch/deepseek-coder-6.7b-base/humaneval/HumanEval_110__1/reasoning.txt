The function `exchange` is called with ( lst1 = [100, 200], lst2 = [200, 200] ).
Inside the function, two variables `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The element 100 is odd, so odd becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 200 is even, so even becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The element 200 is even, so even becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The element 200 is even, so even becomes 3.

Iteration 1:
    -The element 200 is even, so even becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 200 is even, so even becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The element 200 is even, so even becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The element 200 is even, so even becomes 4.

The condition `even >= odd` is true, so the function returns "YES".
