The function sort_array takes an array arr as input and returns a sorted version of the array based on the number of ones in the binary representation of each element.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [], we need to sort the array based on the number of ones in the binary representation of each element.
Since the input array is empty, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [] is also an empty array.
