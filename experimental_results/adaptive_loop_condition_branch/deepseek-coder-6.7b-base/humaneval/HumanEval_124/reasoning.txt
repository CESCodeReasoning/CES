The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '03-11-2000' ).
The function first strips the leading and trailing whitespaces from the input date string.
Then, it splits the date string into its components (month, day, and year) using the split method.
The month, day, and year are converted to integers using the int function.
Next, the function checks if the month is valid (between 1 and 12).
If the month is not valid, the function returns False.
If the month is valid, the function checks if the day is valid for the corresponding month.
If the day is not valid, the function returns False.
If the day is valid, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('03-11-2000')` is True.
