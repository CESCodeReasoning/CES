The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "5 apples and 6 oranges", n = 19 ).
Inside the function, a variable `lis` is initialized as an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '5' is a digit, so it is appended to the list.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'a' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'p' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'p' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 'l' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 6:
    -The character 'e' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 7:
    -The character 's' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 8:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 9:
    -The character 'a' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 10:
    -The character 'n' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 11:
    -The character 'd' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 12:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 13:
    -The character '6' is a digit, so it is appended to the list.
Iteration 14:
    -The character 'o' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 15:
    -The character 'r' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 16:
    -The character 'a' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 17:
    -The character 'n' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 18:
    -The character 'g' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 19:
    -The character 'e' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 20:
    -The character 's' is not a digit, so it is ignored.

The final list `lis` contains [5, 6].
The function returns the difference between `n` and the sum of the elements in `lis`, which is 19 - (5 + 6) = 10.
