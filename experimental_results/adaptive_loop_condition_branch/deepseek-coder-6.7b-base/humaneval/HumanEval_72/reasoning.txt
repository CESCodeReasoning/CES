The function `will_it_fly` is called with ( q = [3, 2, 3], w = 9 ).
The condition `sum(q) > w` is false. The first branch is not taken.
The loop iterates from 0 to 1 (since ( len(q) - 1 = 2 )).
First Iteration (i = 0, j = 1):
    - q[i] != q[j] when i=0 and j=1
    - The conditin `q[i] != q[j]` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - The function returns False.
