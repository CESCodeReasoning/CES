The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The value of `s` is updated to 2.
    -The value of `max_sum` is updated to 2.
Iteration 2:
    -The value of `s` is updated to 5.
    -The value of `max_sum` is updated to 5.
Iteration 3:
    -The value of `s` is updated to 9.
    -The value of `max_sum` is updated to 9.
Iteration 4:
    -The value of `s` is updated to 8.
    -The value of `max_sum` is not updated.
Iteration 5:
    -The value of `s` is updated to 10.
    -The value of `max_sum` is not updated.
Iteration 6:
    -The value of `s` is updated to 14.
    -The value of `max_sum` is updated to 14.

The final value of `max_sum` is 14.
The final value of `min_sum` is -14.
