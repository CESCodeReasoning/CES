The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, -1, 2, -2, 5, -5, 4, -4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The operation 1 is added to the balance, resulting in a balance of 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The operation -1 is subtracted from the balance, resulting in a balance of -1.
    -The balance is now less than 0, so the function returns True.
