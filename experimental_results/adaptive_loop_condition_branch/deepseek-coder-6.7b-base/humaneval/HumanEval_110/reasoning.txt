The function `exchange` is called with ( lst1 = [1, 2, 3, 4], lst2 = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, two variables `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The element 1 in lst1 is odd, so odd becomes 1.
    -The element 1 in lst2 is even, so even becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 2 in lst1 is even, so even becomes 2.
    -The element 2 in lst2 is even, so even becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The element 3 in lst1 is odd, so odd becomes 2.
    -The element 3 in lst2 is odd, so odd becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The element 4 in lst1 is even, so even becomes 3.
    -The element 4 in lst2 is even, so even becomes 3.

The condition `even >= odd` is true, so the function returns "YES".
