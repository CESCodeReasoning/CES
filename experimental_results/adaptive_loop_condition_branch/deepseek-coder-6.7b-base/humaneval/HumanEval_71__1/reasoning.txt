The function `triangle_area` is called with ( a = 1, b = 2, c = 10 ).
The condition `a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a` is false.
The condition `b + c <= a` is true.
The condition `a + b <= c` is false.
The condition `a + c <= b` is false.
The if branch is not taken, and the else branch is executed.
The area of the triangle is calculated using the formula:
area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
where s = (a + b + c) / 2
The area is rounded to 2 decimal places using the round function.
The final output of the function `triangle_area(1, 2, 10)` is -1.
