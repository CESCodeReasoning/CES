The function `fix_spaces` is called with ( text = "Example" ).
Inside the function, a variable `new_text` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates through each character in the input string (text).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - text[i] == " " when text[0]="E"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "E".
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - text[i] == " " when text[1]="x"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Ex".
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - text[i] == " " when text[2]="a"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Exa".
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - text[i] == " " when text[3]="m"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Exam".
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - text[i] == " " when text[4]="p"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Examp".
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - text[i] == " " when text[5]="l"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Exampl".
Seventh Iteration (i = 6):
    - text[i] == " " when text[6]="e"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Example".
Eighth Iteration (i = 7):
    - text[i] == " " when text[7]="\0"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `end - start > 2` is false. The second condition is not taken.
    - `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Example".
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `new_text`, which is now "Example".
