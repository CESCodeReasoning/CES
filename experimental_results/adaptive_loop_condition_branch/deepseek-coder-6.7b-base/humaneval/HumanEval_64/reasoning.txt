The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "abcde" ).
The variable `vowels` is initialized to the string "aeiouAEIOU".
The variable `n_vowels` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
First Iteration (c = 'a')
   - `c` is 'a', which is not in the string `vowels`.
   - The condition `c in vowels` is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels` remains unchanged.
Second Iteration (c = 'b')
   - `c` is 'b', which is not in the string `vowels`.
   - The same condition is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels` remains unchanged.
Third Iteration (c = 'c')
   - `c` is 'c', which is not in the string `vowels`.
   - The same condition is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels` remains unchanged.
Fourth Iteration (c = 'd')
   - `c` is 'd', which is not in the string `vowels`.
   - The same condition is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels` remains unchanged.
Fifth Iteration (c = 'e')
   - `c` is 'e', which is in the string `vowels`.
   - The condition `c in vowels` is true.
   - Action: `n_vowels` is incremented by 1 (`n_vowels + 1 = 1`).
If Statement
   - The last character of the string `s` is 'e'.
   - The condition `s[-1] == 'y' or s[-1] == 'Y'` is false.
   - The `else` block's action: `n_vowels` remains unchanged.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `n_vowels`, which is now 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("abcde")` is 1.
