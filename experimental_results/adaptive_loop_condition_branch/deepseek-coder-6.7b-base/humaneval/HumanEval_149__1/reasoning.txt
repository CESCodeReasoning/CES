The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"] ).
Inside the function, the input list `lst` is sorted in ascending order.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of "school" is 6, which is even.
    -The string "school" is added to the new list `new_lst`.
Iteration 2:
    -The length of "AI" is 2, which is even.
    -The string "AI" is added to the new list `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The length of "asdf" is 4, which is even.
    -The string "asdf" is added to the new list `new_lst`.
Iteration 4:
    -The length of "b" is 1, which is odd.
    -The string "b" is not added to the new list `new_lst`.

The new list `new_lst` is sorted in ascending order based on the length of the strings.
The function returns the sorted list `new_lst`.
