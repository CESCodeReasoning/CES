The function sort_array takes an array arr as input and returns a sorted array based on the following criteria:
1. The elements of the array are sorted in ascending order.
2. If two elements have the same number of 1's in their binary representation, they are sorted in ascending order.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4], we need to sort the array based on the above criteria.

First, we sort the array in ascending order. This gives us [1,2,3,4,5].

Next, we sort the array based on the number of 1's in their binary representation. Since 1 has 1 1 in its binary representation, 5 has 2 1's in its binary representation, 2 has 1 1 in its binary representation, 3 has 2 1's in its binary representation, and 4 has 1 1 in its binary representation, the sorted array is [1,2,3,4,5].

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4] is [1,2,3,4,5].
