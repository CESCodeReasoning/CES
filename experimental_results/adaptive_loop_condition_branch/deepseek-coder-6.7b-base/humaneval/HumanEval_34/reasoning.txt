The function unique takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of unique elements in l.
To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], we need to remove duplicates from the input list and sort the resulting list.
The input list contains the elements 5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, and 123.
The unique elements in the input list are 5, 3, 2, 9, and 0.
The sorted unique elements in the input list are 0, 2, 3, 5, and 9.
Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123] is [0, 2, 3, 5, 9].
