The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "bYe" ).
The variable `vowels` is initialized to the string "aeiouAEIOU".
The variable `n_vowels` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
First Iteration (c = 'b')
   - `c` is 'b', which is not a vowel.
   - The condition `c in vowels` is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels` remains unchanged.
Second Iteration (c = 'Y')
   - `c` is 'Y', which is a vowel.
   - The condition `c in vowels` is true.
   - Action: `n_vowels` is incremented by 1 (`n_vowels + 1`).
Third Iteration (c = 'e')
   - `c` is 'e', which is a vowel.
   - The condition `c in vowels` is true.
   - Action: `n_vowels` is incremented by 1 (`n_vowels + 1`).
Fourth Iteration (c = '')
   - `c` is '', which is not a vowel.
   - The condition `c in vowels` is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels` remains unchanged.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `n_vowels`, which is now 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("bYe")` is 2.
