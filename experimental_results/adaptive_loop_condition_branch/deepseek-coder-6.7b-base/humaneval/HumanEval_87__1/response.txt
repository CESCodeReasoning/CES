<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the Deepseek Coder model, developed by Deepseek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science. For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.
### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *


def get_row(lst, x):
    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst))
              for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
    return sorted(
        sorted(
            coords,
            key=lambda x: x[1],
            reverse=True),
        key=lambda x: x[0])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3)
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function get_row takes a list of lists lst and an integer x as input and returns a list of tuples containing the coordinates of the first occurrence of x in lst.
To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3, we need to find the coordinates of the first occurrence of 3 in the input list.
The first occurrence of 3 is at the second row and second column of the input list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3 is [(1, 1)].
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[(1, 1)]
[/OUTPUT]
