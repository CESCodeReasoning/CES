The function `is_multiply_prime` takes an integer `a` as its parameter.
The function `is_multiply_prime` calls the function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime.
The function `is_multiply_prime` iterates through all possible combinations of three prime numbers (i, j, k) and checks if their product is equal to `a`.
First Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.
