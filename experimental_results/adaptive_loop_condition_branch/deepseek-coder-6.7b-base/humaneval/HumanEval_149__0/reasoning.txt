The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["d", "dcba", "abcd", "a"] ).
Inside the function, the input list `lst` is sorted in ascending order.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of the string "d" is 1, which is not even.
Iteration 2:
    -The length of the string "dcba" is 4, which is even.
    -The string "dcba" is added to the new list `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The length of the string "abcd" is 4, which is even.
    -The string "abcd" is added to the new list `new_lst`.
Iteration 4:
    -The length of the string "a" is 1, which is not even.

The new list `new_lst` is sorted in ascending order based on the length of the strings.
The function returns the sorted list `new_lst`.
