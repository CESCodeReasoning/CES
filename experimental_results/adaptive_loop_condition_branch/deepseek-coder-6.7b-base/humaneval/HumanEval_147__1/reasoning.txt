The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The function first calculates the list A of n elements, where each element is the square of the index minus the index plus 1.
The function then iterates through each element in the list A to find all possible triples that add up to a multiple of 3.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - `j` is 1, k in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5.
    - `k` is 2, k in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - `k` is 3, k in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - `k` is 4, k in the inner loop is 5.
    - `k` is 5, k in the inner loop is 5.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - `j` is 2, k in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - `k` is 3, k in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - `k` is 4, k in the inner loop is 5.
    - `k` is 5, k in the inner loop is 5.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
    - `j` is 3, k in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - `k` is 4, k in the inner loop is 5.
    - `k` is 5, k in the inner loop is 5.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
    - `j` is 4, k in the inner loop is 5.
    - `k` is 5, k in the inner loop is 5.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - `j` is 5, k in the inner loop is 5.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.
