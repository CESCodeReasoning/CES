The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [127, 97, 8192] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 2 (since ( len(lst) = 3 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - The condition `i < len(lst)` is true.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is true.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The first branch is taken. `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 127.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - The condition `i < len(lst)` is true.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The first branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - The condition `i < len(lst)` is true.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `maxx`, which is now 127.
