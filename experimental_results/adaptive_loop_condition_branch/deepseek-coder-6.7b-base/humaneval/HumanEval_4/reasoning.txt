The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers.
To determine the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers, we first need to calculate the mean of the numbers.
The mean is the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers.
We can calculate the mean by dividing the sum of the numbers by the number of numbers.
Once we have the mean, we can calculate the mean absolute deviation by taking the absolute value of the difference between each number and the mean, and then dividing by the number of numbers.
The mean absolute deviation is the average of the absolute differences between each number and the mean.
