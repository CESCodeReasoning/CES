The function reverse_delete takes two arguments: s and c. The function first removes all characters in the string s that are in the string c. Then, it returns a tuple containing the modified string s and a boolean value indicating whether the modified string is a palindrome.

To determine the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcdedcba", we need to remove all characters in the string "abcdedcba" that are in the string "v".

The modified string is "abcdedcba", which is not a palindrome.

Therefore, the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcdedcba" is ("abcdedcba", False).
