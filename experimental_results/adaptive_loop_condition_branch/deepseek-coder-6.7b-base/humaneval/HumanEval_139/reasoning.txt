The function `special_factorial` is called with (n = 4).
Inside the function, two variables `fact_i` and `special_fact` are initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 1 through 4 (since (n = 4)).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    fact_i = 1 * 1 = 1
    special_fact = 1 * 1 = 1
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    fact_i = 1 * 2 = 2
    special_fact = 1 * 2 = 2
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    fact_i = 2 * 3 = 6
    special_fact = 2 * 6 = 12
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    fact_i = 6 * 4 = 24
    special_fact = 12 * 24 = 288
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `special_fact`, which is now 288.
