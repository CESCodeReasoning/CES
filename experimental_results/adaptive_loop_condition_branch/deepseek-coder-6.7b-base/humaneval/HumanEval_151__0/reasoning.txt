The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of all positive odd numbers in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [-10, -20, -30], we need to find the squares of all positive odd numbers in the list.
The positive odd numbers in the list are -1, -3, and -5.
The squares of these numbers are 1, 9, and 25.
Therefore, the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [-10, -20, -30] is 25.
