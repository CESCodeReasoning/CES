The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest negative integer in the list and the smallest positive integer in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [], we need to find the largest negative integer in the list and the smallest positive integer in the list.
Since the input list is empty, there are no negative integers in the list, so the largest negative integer is None.
Similarly, since the input list is empty, there are no positive integers in the list, so the smallest positive integer is None.
Therefore, the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [] is (None, None).
