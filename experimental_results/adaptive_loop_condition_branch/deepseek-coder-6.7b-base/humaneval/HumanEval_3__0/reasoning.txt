The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -4, 5, 6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The operation 1 is added to the balance, resulting in a balance of 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The operation 2 is added to the balance, resulting in a balance of 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The operation -4 is added to the balance, resulting in a balance of -1.
    -The balance is less than 0, so the function returns True.

Therefore, the function `below_zero` returns True for the input [1, 2, -4, 5, 6].
