The function `compare_one` is called with ( a = 1, b = 2 ).
`temp_a` and `temp_b` are initialized to `a` and `b`, respectively.
The first if statement checks if `temp_a` is an instance of `str`. Since `temp_a` is an integer, the condition is not met, and the if branch is not taken.
The second if statement checks if `temp_b` is an instance of `str`. Since `temp_b` is an integer, the condition is not met, and the if branch is not taken.
The float conversion of `temp_a` and `temp_b` is performed.
The condition `float(temp_a) == float(temp_b)` is not met, so the else branch is taken.
The method returns `a` if `float(temp_a) > float(temp_b)`, otherwise it returns `b`. Since `float(temp_a)` is greater than `float(temp_b)`, the method returns `a`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one(1, 2)` is 1.
