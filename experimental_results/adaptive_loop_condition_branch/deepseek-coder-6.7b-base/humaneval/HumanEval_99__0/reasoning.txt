The function `closest_integer` is called with ( value = "14.5" ).
The condition ( value.count('.') == 1 ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken.
The condition ( value[-2:] == '.5' ) is not satisfied, therefore the else branch is taken.
The condition ( num > 0 ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken.
The function `ceil` is called with ( num = 14.5 ).
The function `ceil` returns 15 as the output.
