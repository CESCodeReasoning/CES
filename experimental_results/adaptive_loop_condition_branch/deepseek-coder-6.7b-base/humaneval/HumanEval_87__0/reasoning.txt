The function get_row takes a list of lists lst and an integer x as input and returns a list of tuples containing the coordinates of the first occurrence of x in lst.
To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2, we need to find the coordinates of the first occurrence of 2 in the list [[1]].
Since 2 is not present in the list [[1]], the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2 is an empty list.
