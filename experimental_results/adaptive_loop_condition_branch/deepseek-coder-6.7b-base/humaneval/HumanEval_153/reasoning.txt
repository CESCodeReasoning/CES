The function `Strongest_Extension` is called with ( class_name = 'Watashi', extensions = ['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe'] ).

Iteration 1:
    -The extension 'tEN' has 1 uppercase letter and 2 lowercase letters, so it is stronger than the current strongest extension.
Iteration 2:
    -The extension 'niNE' has 1 uppercase letter and 3 lowercase letters, so it is stronger than the current strongest extension.
Iteration 3:
    -The extension 'eIGHt8OKe' has 2 uppercase letters and 5 lowercase letters, so it is stronger than the current strongest extension.

Therefore, the strongest extension is 'eIGHt8OKe'.
