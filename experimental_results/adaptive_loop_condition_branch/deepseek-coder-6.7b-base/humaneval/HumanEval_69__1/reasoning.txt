The function `search` is called with ( lst = [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] ).
Inside the function, a variable `frq` is initialized to a list of 0s with length equal to the maximum element in the input list `lst` plus 1.

Iteration 1:
    -The value at index 8 in `frq` is incremented by 1, resulting in `frq[8] = 1`.
Iteration 2:
    -The value at index 8 in `frq` is incremented by 1, resulting in `frq[8] = 2`.
Iteration 3:
    -The value at index 8 in `frq` is incremented by 1, resulting in `frq[8] = 3`.
Iteration 4:
    -The value at index 8 in `frq` is incremented by 1, resulting in `frq[8] = 4`.
Iteration 5:
    -The value at index 8 in `frq` is incremented by 1, resulting in `frq[8] = 5`.
Iteration 6:
    -The value at index 8 in `frq` is incremented by 1, resulting in `frq[8] = 6`.
Iteration 7:
    -The value at index 8 in `frq` is incremented by 1, resulting in `frq[8] = 7`.
Iteration 8:
    -The value at index 8 in `frq` is incremented by 1, resulting in `frq[8] = 8`.

The loop iterates from 1 through 8 (since ( len(frq) = 9 )).
First Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which satisfies ( 1 <= i < len(frq) ).
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is true.
   - Action: `ans = i` results in `ans = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which still satisfies ( 1 <= i < len(frq) ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `ans = i` updates `ans` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which now satisfies ( 3 <= i < len(frq) ).
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is true (while the first condition `frq[i] >= i` is false).
   - Action: `ans = i` updates `ans` to 3 (`2 + 1 = 3`).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, also satisfying ( 3 <= i < len(frq) ).
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is still true.
   - Action: `ans = i` updates `ans` to 4 (`3 + 1 = 4`).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, now outside the previous conditions, falling into the `else` block.
   - The `else` block's action: `ans = i` updates `ans` to 5 (`4 + 1 = 5`).
Sixth Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is 6, also satisfying ( 5 <= i < len(frq) ).
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is true (while the first condition `frq[i] >= i` is false).
   - Action: `ans = i` updates `ans` to 6 (`5 + 1 = 6`).
Seventh Iteration (i = 7)
   - `i` is 7, also satisfying ( 6 <= i < len(frq) ).
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is true (while the first condition `frq[i] >= i` is false).
   - Action: `ans = i` updates `ans` to 7 (`6 + 1 = 7`).
Eighth Iteration (i = 8)
   - `i` is 8, also satisfying ( 7 <= i < len(frq) ).
