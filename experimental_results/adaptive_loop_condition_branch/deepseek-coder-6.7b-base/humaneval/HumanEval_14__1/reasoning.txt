The function `all_prefixes` is called with (string = '').
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.
`len(string)` = 0 since there are 0 characters in ''.
The loop iterates from 0 to 0 since `range(len(string))`= [0].

First Iteration(i = 0):
    string[:i + 1] = ''
    result.append('') results in result = ['']
