The function `sort_even` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3] ).
The list `l` is sliced into two sublists: `evens` and `odds`.
`evens` contains the even-indexed elements of `l`, while `odds` contains the odd-indexed elements.
The `evens` list is sorted in ascending order.
The function then iterates over the zipped `evens` and `odds` lists using a for loop.
For each iteration, the even element `e` is appended to the `ans` list, followed by the odd element `o`.
If the length of `evens` is greater than the length of `odds`, the last element of `evens` is appended to the `ans` list.
Finally, the function returns the `ans` list as a tuple.
