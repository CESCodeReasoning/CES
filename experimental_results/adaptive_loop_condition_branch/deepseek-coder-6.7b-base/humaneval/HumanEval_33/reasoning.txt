The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a new list with the elements of l sorted in ascending order, with every third element being sorted.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to sort the elements of the list [1, 2, 3] with every third element being sorted.
The first element of the list is 1, which is not sorted.
The second element of the list is 2, which is not sorted.
The third element of the list is 3, which is sorted.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3].
