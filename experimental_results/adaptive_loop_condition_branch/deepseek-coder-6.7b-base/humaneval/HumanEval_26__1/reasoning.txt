The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements of the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [], we need to remove all duplicates from the input list.
Since the input list is empty, there are no duplicates to remove, so the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [] is [].
