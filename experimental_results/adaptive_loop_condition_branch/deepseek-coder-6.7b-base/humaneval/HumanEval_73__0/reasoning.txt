The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1, 4, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of the array is 1, and the last element is 2.
    -Since 1 is not equal to 2, ans is incremented by 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The first element of the array is 4, and the last element is 2.
    -Since 4 is not equal to 2, ans is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the final value of ans is 2.
