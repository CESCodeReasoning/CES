The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements of the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 4], we need to remove the duplicates from the input list.
The input list contains four unique elements: 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] is [1, 2, 3, 4].
