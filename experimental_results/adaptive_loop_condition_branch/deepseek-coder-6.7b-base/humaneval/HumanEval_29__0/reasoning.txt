The function filter_by_prefix takes a list of strings and a prefix string as input and returns a list of strings that start with the given prefix.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_prefix on the input ['abc', 'abcd', 'abcde'], 'abc', we need to filter the list of strings to only include those that start with the prefix 'abc'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_by_prefix on the input ['abc', 'abcd', 'abcde'], 'abc' is ['abc', 'abcd'].
