The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of the array is 1, and the last element is 2.
    -Since they are not equal, ans is incremented by 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element of the array is 2, and the second-last element is 2.
    -Since they are equal, no change is made to ans.
Iteration 3:
    -The third element of the array is 3, and the third-last element is 3.
    -Since they are equal, no change is made to ans.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth element of the array is 4, and the fourth-last element is 4.
    -Since they are equal, no change is made to ans.
Iteration 5:
    -The fifth element of the array is 3, and the fifth-last element is 2.
    -Since they are not equal, ans is incremented by 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The sixth element of the array is 2, and the sixth-last element is 2.
    -Since they are equal, no change is made to ans.
Iteration 7:
    -The seventh element of the array is 2, and the seventh-last element is 2.
    -Since they are equal, no change is made to ans.

Therefore, the final value of ans is 1.
