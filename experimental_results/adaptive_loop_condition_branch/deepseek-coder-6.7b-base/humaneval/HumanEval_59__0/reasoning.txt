The function `largest_prime_factor` is called with ( n = 330 ).
Inside the function, a variable `largest` is initialized to 1.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 2 is a factor of 330, and it is prime, so largest becomes 2.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 3 is a factor of 330, and it is prime, so largest becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 5 is a factor of 330, and it is prime, so largest becomes 5.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 6 is a factor of 330, but it is not prime, so it is not updated.
Iteration 5:
    -The number 7 is a factor of 330, and it is prime, so largest becomes 7.
Iteration 6:
