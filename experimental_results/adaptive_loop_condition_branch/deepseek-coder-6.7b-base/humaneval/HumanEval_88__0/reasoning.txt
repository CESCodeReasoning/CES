The function sort_array takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted array of integers.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], we need to sort the array in ascending order.
The array [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6] is sorted in ascending order to get [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
