### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.

    return duplicates
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
find_all_duplicate([3, 5, 4, 3, 7, 4])
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function find_all_duplicate(numbers) takes a list of numbers([3, 5, 4, 3, 7, 4]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterats through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=3: compare with 5, 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 1 (numbers[j]=5), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 3 to duplicates.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken. 
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=5: compare with 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=4: compare with 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 4 to duplicates
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=3, Compare with 7, 4:
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - numbers[i] = 7, compare with 4:
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.

[/CODE]

[INPUT]
common([4, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2, 4])
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function common(l1, l2) takes two lists as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the first list to compare it against the elements in the second list.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by e1 in the outer loop, compare it with every element in the second list.
First Iteration (e1=4):
    - `e1` is 4, e2 in the inner loop is 3, 2, 8.
    - 4 != 3, 4 != 2, 4 != 8:
        - When e2 = 3, the condition `e1 == e2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When e2 = 2, the condition `e1 == e2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When e2 = 8, the condition `e1 == e2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (e1=3):
    - `e1` is 3, e2 in the inner loop is 2, 4.
    - 3 == 2, 3 != 4:
        - When e2 = 2, the condition `e1 == e2` is True, the if branch is taken. Add 3 to ret.
        - When e2 = 4, the condition `e1 == e2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (e1=2):
    - `e1` is 2, e2 in the inner loop is 4.
    - 2 == 4, 2 == 4:
        - When e2 = 4, the condition `e1 == e2` is True, the if branch is taken. Add 2 to ret.
Forth Iteration (e1=8):
    - `e1` is 8, e2 in the inner loop is 3, 2, 4.
    - 8 != 3, 8 != 2, 8 != 4:
        - When e2 = 3, the condition `e1 == e2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When e2 = 2, the condition `e1 == e2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When e2 = 4, the condition `e1 == e2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
