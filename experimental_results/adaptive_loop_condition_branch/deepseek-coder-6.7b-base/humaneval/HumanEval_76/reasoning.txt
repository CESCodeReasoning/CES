The function `is_simple_power` is called with ( x = 16, n = 2 ).
The condition ( n == 1 ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The loop iterates from 1 through 16 (since ( x = 16 )).
First Iteration (power = 1):
    - power < x when power=1
    -`power = power * n` updates `power` to 2 ( 1 * 2 = 2 ).
Second Iteration (power = 2):
    - power < x when power=2
    -`power = power * n` updates `power` to 4 ( 2 * 2 = 4 ).
Third Iteration (power = 4):
    - power < x when power=4
    -`power = power * n` updates `power` to 8 ( 4 * 2 = 8 ).
Fourth Iteration (power = 8):
    - power < x when power=8
    -`power = power * n` updates `power` to 16 ( 8 * 2 = 16 ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( power == x ) is satisfied, therefore the function returns `True` as the output.
