The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [123, -123, 20, 0 , 1, 2, -3], k = 3 ).
The condition `k == 0` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
The last `k` elements of the sorted array are stored in `ans`.
The function returns `ans`, which is [20, 1, 2].
