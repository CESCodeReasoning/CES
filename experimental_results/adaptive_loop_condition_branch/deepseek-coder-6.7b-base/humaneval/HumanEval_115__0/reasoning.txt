The function max_fill takes a grid of integers and a capacity as input and returns the maximum number of times the capacity can be filled in the grid.

To determine the output of executing the function max_fill on the input [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], capacity 2, we need to calculate the number of times the capacity can be filled in the grid.

The grid is a 4x4 matrix, and the capacity is 2. We can fill the capacity in the grid in the following way:

Fill the capacity in the first row, which is [0,0,1,1]. The capacity can be filled in the first row twice, once in the first column and once in the second column.
Fill the capacity in the second row, which is [0,0,0,0]. The capacity cannot be filled in the second row.
Fill the capacity in the third row, which is [1,1,1,1]. The capacity can be filled in the third row once, in the first column.
Fill the capacity in the fourth row, which is [0,1,1,1]. The capacity can be filled in the fourth row twice, once in the first column and once in the second column.
Therefore, the output of executing the function max_fill on the input [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], capacity 2 is 7.
