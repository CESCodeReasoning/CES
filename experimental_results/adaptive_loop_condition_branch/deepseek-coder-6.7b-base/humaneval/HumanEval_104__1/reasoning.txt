The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [12345, 2033, 111, 151] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `odd_digit_elements` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The integer 12345 is not all odd digits, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 2:
    -The integer 2033 is not all odd digits, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 3:
    -The integer 111 is all odd digits, so it is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 4:
    -The integer 151 is not all odd digits, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the sorted list of odd digit elements, which is [111].
