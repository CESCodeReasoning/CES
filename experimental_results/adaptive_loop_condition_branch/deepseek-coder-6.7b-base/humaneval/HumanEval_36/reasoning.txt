The function `fizz_buzz` is called with ( n = 50 ).
Inside the function, an empty list `ns` is initialized.
The loop iterates from 0 through 49 (since ( n = 50 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 % 11 == 0 or 0 % 13 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `ns.append(i)` appends 0 to `ns`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which still satisfies ( 1 % 11 == 0 or 1 % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `ns.append(i)` appends 1 to `ns`.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which still satisfies ( 2 % 11 == 0 or 2 % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `ns.append(i)` appends 2 to `ns`.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which still satisfies ( 3 % 11 == 0 or 3 % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `ns.append(i)` appends 3 to `ns`.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which still satisfies ( 4 % 11 == 0 or 4 % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `ns.append(i)` appends 4 to `ns`.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which still satisfies ( 5 % 11 == 0 or 5 % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `ns.append(i)` appends 5 to `ns`.
Seventh Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is 6, which still satisfies ( 6 % 11 == 0 or 6 % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `ns.append(i)` appends 6 to `ns`.
Eighth Iteration (i = 7)
   - `i` is 7, which still satisfies ( 7 % 11 == 0 or 7 % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `ns.append(i)` appends 7 to `ns`.
Ninth Iteration (i = 8)
   - `i` is 8, which still satisfies ( 8 % 11 == 0 or 8 % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `ns.append(i)` appends 8 to `ns`.
Tenth Iteration (i = 9)
   - `i` is 9, which still satisfies ( 9 % 11 == 0 or 9 % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `ns.append(i)` appends 9 to `ns`.
Eleventh Iteration (i = 10)
   - `i` is 10, which still satisfies ( 10 % 11 == 0 or 10 % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `ns.append(i)` appends 10 to `ns`.
Twelfth Iteration (i = 11)
   - `i` is 11, which still satisfies ( 11 % 11 == 0 or 11 % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `ns.append(i)` appends 11 to `ns`.
Thirteenth Iteration (i = 12)
   - `i` is 12, which still satisfies ( 12 % 11 == 0 or 12 % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is true.
