The function `how_many_times` is called with ( string = 'john doe', substring = 'john' ).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The substring 'john' is found at index 0 in the string 'john doe'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is true.
    -Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The substring 'john' is not found at index 1 in the string 'john doe'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is false.
    -Action: `times` remains unchanged.
Iteration 3:
    -The substring 'john' is found at index 3 in the string 'john doe'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is true.
    -Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The substring 'john' is not found at index 4 in the string 'john doe'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is false.
    -Action: `times` remains unchanged.
Iteration 5:
    -The substring 'john' is not found at index 5 in the string 'john doe'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is false.
    -Action: `times` remains unchanged.
Iteration 6:
    -The substring 'john' is not found at index 6 in the string 'john doe'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is false.
    -Action: `times` remains unchanged.
Iteration 7:
    -The substring 'john' is not found at index 7 in the string 'john doe'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is false.
    -Action: `times` remains unchanged.
Iteration 8:
    -The substring 'john' is not found at index 8 in the string 'john doe'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is false.
    -Action: `times` remains unchanged.
Iteration 9:
    -The substring 'john' is not found at index 9 in the string 'john doe'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is false.
    -Action: `times` remains unchanged.
Iteration 10:
    -The substring 'john' is not found at index 10 in the string 'john doe'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is false.
    -Action: `times` remains unchanged.
Iteration 11:
    -The substring 'john' is not found at index 11 in the string 'john doe'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is false.
    -Action: `times` remains unchanged.
Iteration 12:
    -The substring 'john' is not found at index 12 in the string 'john doe'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is false.
    -Action: `times` remains unchanged.
Iteration 13:
    -The substring 'john' is not found at index 13 in the string 'john doe'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is false.
    -Action: `times` remains unchanged.
Iteration 14:
    -The substring 'john' is not found at index 14 in the string 'john doe'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is false.
    -Action: `times` remains unchanged.
Iteration 15:
