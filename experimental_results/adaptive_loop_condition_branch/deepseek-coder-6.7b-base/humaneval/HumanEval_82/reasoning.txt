The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Hello' ).
The length of the string is 5.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of the string is not 0 or 1, so the condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is false.
Iteration 2:
    -The length of the string is not divisible by 2, so the condition `l % i == 0` is false.
Iteration 3:
    -The length of the string is not divisible by 3, so the condition `l % i == 0` is false.
Iteration 4:
    -The length of the string is not divisible by 4, so the condition `l % i == 0` is false.
Iteration 5:
    -The length of the string is not divisible by 5, so the condition `l % i == 0` is false.
