The function sort_array takes an array arr as input and returns a sorted array based on the following criteria:
1. The elements of the array are sorted in ascending order.
2. If two elements have the same number of 1's in their binary representation, they are sorted in ascending order.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [3,6,44,12,32,5], we need to sort the array based on the above criteria.

First, we sort the array in ascending order. This gives us [3,5,6,12,32,44].

Next, we sort the elements of the array based on the number of 1's in their binary representation.

The binary representation of 3 is 011, which has 1 1-bit.
The binary representation of 5 is 101, which has 2 1-bits.
The binary representation of 6 is 110, which has 1 1-bit.
The binary representation of 12 is 1100, which has 2 1-bits.
The binary representation of 32 is 100000, which has 1 1-bit.
The binary representation of 44 is 101100, which has 3 1-bits.

Therefore, the sorted array based on the above criteria is [3,6,12,32,5,44].
