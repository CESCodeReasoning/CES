The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["aa", "a", "aaa"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of the string "aa" is even, so it is added to the new list.
Iteration 2:
    -The length of the string "a" is odd, so it is not added to the new list.
Iteration 3:
    -The length of the string "aaa" is even, so it is added to the new list.

The new list is sorted in ascending order based on the length of the strings.
