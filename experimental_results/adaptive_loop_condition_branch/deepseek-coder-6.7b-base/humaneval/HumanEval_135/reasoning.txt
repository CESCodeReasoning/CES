The function `can_arrange` is called with ( arr = [1,2,4,3,5] ).
The variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The loop iterates from 1 through 4 (since ( len(arr) = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    - i < 5 when i=1
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - i < 5 when i=2
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `ind = i` updates `ind` to 2 ( -1 + 2 = 2 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - i < 5 when i=3
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    - i < 5 when i=4
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `ind = i` updates `ind` to 4 ( 2 + 2 = 4 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is now 4.
