For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.
### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *


def solution(lst):
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx % 2 == 0 and x % 2 == 1])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
solution([30, 13, 23, 32])
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function solution takes a list of integers lst as input and returns the sum of all odd integers in the list that have even indices.
To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32], we need to find the sum of all odd integers in the list that have even indices.
The odd integers in the list that have even indices are 13 and 32.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32] is 45.
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
45
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
def solution(lst):
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx % 2 == 0 and x % 2 == 1])
