The function solution takes a list of integers lst as input and returns the sum of all odd integers in the list that have even indices.
To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32], we need to find the sum of all odd integers in the list that have even indices.
The odd integers in the list that have even indices are 13 and 32.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32] is 45.
