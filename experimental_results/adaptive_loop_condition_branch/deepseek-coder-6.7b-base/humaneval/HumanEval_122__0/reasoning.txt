The function add_elements takes an array arr and an integer k as input and returns the sum of the first k elements of the array.
To determine the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9] and 4, we need to add the first 4 elements of the array.
The first 4 elements of the array are 111, 21, 3, and 4000.
The sum of these elements is 111 + 21 + 3 + 4000 = 4133.
Therefore, the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9] and 4 is 4133.
