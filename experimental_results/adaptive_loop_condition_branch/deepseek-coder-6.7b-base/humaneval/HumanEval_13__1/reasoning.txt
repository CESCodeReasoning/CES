The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 144, b = 60 ).
First Iteration:
    - a = 144, b = 60.
    -`a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 60 ( 144 % 60 = 60 ) and `b` to 144 ( 60 ).
Second Iteration:
    - a = 60, b = 144.
    -`a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 144 ( 60 % 144 = 144 ) and `b` to 60 ( 144 ).
b is 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 60.
