The function `tri` is called with ( n = 20 ).
The first condition ( n == 0 ) is false, so the function enters the loop.

Iteration 1:
    -The value of i is 2.
    -The condition ( i % 2 == 0 ) is false, so the else block is executed.
    -The value of my_tri[i - 1] is 1, and the value of my_tri[i - 2] is 3.
    -The value of ( i + 3 ) / 2 is 5.5.
    -The value of my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + ( i + 3 ) / 2 is 1 + 3 + 5.5 = 10.5.
    -The value of my_tri is now [1, 3, 10.5].

Iteration 2:
    -The value of i is 3.
    -The condition ( i % 2 == 0 ) is true, so the if block is executed.
    -The value of i / 2 + 1 is 2.
    -The value of my_tri is now [1, 3, 10.5, 2].

Iteration 3:
    -The value of i is 4.
    -The condition ( i % 2 == 0 ) is false, so the else block is executed.
    -The value of my_tri[i - 1] is 2, and the value of my_tri[i - 2] is 10.5.
    -The value of ( i + 3 ) / 2 is 7.
    -The value of my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + ( i + 3 ) / 2 is 2 + 10.5 + 7 = 19.5.
    -The value of my_tri is now [1, 3, 10.5, 2, 19.5].

Iteration 4:
    -The value of i is 5.
    -The condition ( i % 2 == 0 ) is true, so the if block is executed.
    -The value of i / 2 + 1 is 3.
    -The value of my_tri is now [1, 3, 10.5, 2, 19.5, 3].

Iteration 5:
    -The value of i is 6.
    -The condition ( i % 2 == 0 ) is false, so the else block is executed.
    -The value of my_tri[i - 1] is 3, and the value of my_tri[i - 2] is 19.5.
    -The value of ( i + 3 ) / 2 is 8.
    -The value of my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + ( i + 3 ) / 2 is 3 + 19.5 + 8 = 29.5.
    -The value of my_tri is now [1, 3, 10.5, 2, 19.5, 3, 29.5].

Iteration 6:
    -The value of i is 7.
    -The condition ( i % 2 == 0 ) is true, so the if block is executed.
    -The value of i / 2 + 1 is 4.
    -The value of my_tri is now [1, 3, 10.5, 2, 19.5, 3, 29.5, 4].

Iteration 7:
    -The value of i is 8.
    -The condition ( i % 2 == 0 ) is false, so the else block is executed.
    -The value of my_tri[i - 1] is 4, and the value of my_tri[i - 2] is 29.5.
    -The value of ( i + 3 ) / 2 is 9.
    -The value of my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + ( i + 3 ) / 2 is 4 + 29.5 + 9 = 39.5.
    -The value of my_tri is now [1, 3, 10.
