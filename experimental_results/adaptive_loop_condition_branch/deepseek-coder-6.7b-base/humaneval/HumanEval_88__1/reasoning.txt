The function sort_array takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted array of integers.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [5], we need to sort the array [5] in ascending order.
Since the first element of the array is 5 and the last element of the array is 5, the array is sorted in ascending order.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [5] is [5].
