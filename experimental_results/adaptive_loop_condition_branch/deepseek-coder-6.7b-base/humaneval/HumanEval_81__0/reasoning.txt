The function `numerical_letter_grade` is called with ( grades = [1.2] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `letter_grade` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The value of `gpa` is 1.2.
    -The condition `gpa > 1.0` is false, so the `else` block is executed.
    -The letter grade "D-" is appended to the `letter_grade` list.
