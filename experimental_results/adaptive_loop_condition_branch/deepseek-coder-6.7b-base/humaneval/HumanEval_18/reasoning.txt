The function `how_many_times` is called with ( string = '', substring = 'x' ).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0.

The loop iterates from 0 through 0 (since ( len(string) - len(substring) + 1 ) = 0).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 <= i < len(string) - len(substring) + 1 ).
   - The condition `string[i:i+len(substring)] == substring` is false.
   - Action: `times` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the final output of the function `how_many_times('', 'x')` is 0.
