The function `string_xor` is called with ( a = '111000', b = '101010' ).
The function `xor` is called with ( i = '1', j = '1' ).
The condition `i == j` is false, therefore the else branch is taken and the method returns '1'.
The function `xor` is called with ( i = '1', j = '0' ).
The condition `i == j` is false, therefore the else branch is taken and the method returns '1'.
The function `xor` is called with ( i = '1', j = '0' ).
The condition `i == j` is false, therefore the else branch is taken and the method returns '1'.
The function `xor` is called with ( i = '0', j = '0' ).
The condition `i == j` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns '0'.
The function `xor` is called with ( i = '0', j = '1' ).
The condition `i == j` is false, therefore the else branch is taken and the method returns '1'.
The function `xor` is called with ( i = '0', j = '1' ).
The condition `i == j` is false, therefore the else branch is taken and the method returns '1'.
The function `xor` is called with ( i = '0', j = '0' ).
The condition `i == j` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns '0'.
The function `xor` is called with ( i = '0', j = '0' ).
The condition `i == j` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns '0'.
The function `xor` is called with ( i = '0', j = '0' ).
The condition `i == j` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns '0'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `string_xor('111000', '101010')` is '010010'.
