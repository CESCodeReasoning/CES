The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "aAaaaXa" ).
The condition `s == ""` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
The function iterates through each character in the string `s`.
For each character, the function checks if it is an uppercase letter.
If it is, the function returns the ASCII value of the character.
If it is not, the function returns 0.
The function then sums up the ASCII values of all the uppercase letters in the string.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digitSum("aAaaaXa")` is 13.
