The function get_row takes a list of lists lst and an integer x as input and returns a list of tuples representing the coordinates of the first occurrence of x in lst.
To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[], 1], we need to find the coordinates of the first occurrence of 1 in the list of lists [[], 1].
Since there is no occurrence of 1 in the list of lists [[], 1], the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[], 1] is an empty list.
