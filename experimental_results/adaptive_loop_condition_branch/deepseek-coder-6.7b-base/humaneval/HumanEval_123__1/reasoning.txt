The function `get_odd_collatz` is called with ( n = 5 ).
The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
The else branch is taken. The variable `odd_collatz` is initialized to [5].
The loop iterates from 5 to 1 (since ( n = 5 )).
First Iteration (n = 5):
    - n % 2 == 1 when n=5
    - The conditin `n % 2 == 1` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`odd_collatz.append(int(n))` updates `odd_collatz` to [5, 16].
Second Iteration (n = 16):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=16
    - The conditin `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`n = n / 2` updates `n` to 8.
Third Iteration (n = 8):
    - n % 2 == 1 when n=8
    - The conditin `n % 2 == 1` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`odd_collatz.append(int(n))` updates `odd_collatz` to [5, 16, 8].
Fourth Iteration (n = 4):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=4
    - The conditin `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`n = n / 2` updates `n` to 2.
Fifth Iteration (n = 2):
    - n % 2 == 1 when n=2
    - The conditin `n % 2 == 1` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`odd_collatz.append(int(n))` updates `odd_collatz` to [5, 16, 8, 2].
Sixth Iteration (n = 1):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=1
    - The conditin `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`n = n / 2` updates `n` to 0.
After the loop completes, the function returns the sorted value of `odd_collatz`, which is now [2, 5, 8, 16].
