The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and returns True if n is equal to the sum of two even numbers and False otherwise.
To determine whether the input 13 is equal to the sum of two even numbers, we need to check if 13 is divisible by 2 and is greater than or equal to 8.
Since 13 is not divisible by 2 and is not greater than or equal to 8, the function returns False.
