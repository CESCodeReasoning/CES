The function `modp` is called with (n = 0, p = 101).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to 1.
`range(n)` = [0] since (n = 0).
The loop iterates from 0 to 0 since `range(n)` = [0].

First Iteration (i = 0):
    ret = (2 * ret) % p
    ret = (2 * 1) % 101
    ret = 2 % 101
    ret = 2
