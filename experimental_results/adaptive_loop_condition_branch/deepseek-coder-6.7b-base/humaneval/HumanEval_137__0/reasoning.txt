The function `compare_one` is called with ( a = 5, b = 6 ).
The first if statement checks if `temp_a` is an instance of `str`. Since `temp_a` is an integer, the condition is not met, and the if branch is not taken.
The second if statement checks if `temp_b` is an instance of `str`. Since `temp_b` is an integer, the condition is not met, and the if branch is not taken.
The third if statement checks if `float(temp_a)` is equal to `float(temp_b)`. Since `float(temp_a)` is not equal to `float(temp_b)`, the condition is not met, and the if branch is not taken.
The function returns `a` if `float(temp_a)` is greater than `float(temp_b)`, otherwise it returns `b`. Since `float(temp_a)` is not greater than `float(temp_b)`, the function returns `b`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one(5, 6)` is 6.
