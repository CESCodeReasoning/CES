The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '01-01-2007' ).
The date is stripped to remove leading and trailing whitespace.
The date is split into its components (month, day, year) using the '-' separator.
The month, day, and year are converted to integers.
The first condition checks if the month is less than 1 or greater than 12.
The second condition checks if the day is less than 1 or greater than 31 for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12.
The third condition checks if the day is less than 1 or greater than 30 for months 4, 6, 9, and 11.
The fourth condition checks if the day is less than 1 or greater than 29 for February.
If any of the conditions are not met, the function returns False.
If all conditions are met, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('01-01-2007')` is True.
