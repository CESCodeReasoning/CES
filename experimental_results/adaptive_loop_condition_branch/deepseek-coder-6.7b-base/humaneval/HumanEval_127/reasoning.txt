The function `intersection` is called with ( interval1 = (1, 2), interval2 = (2, 3) ).
The function `is_prime` is called with ( num = 2 ).
The function `is_prime` returns True, as 2 is a prime number.
The length of the intersection is 1, which is greater than 0 and is a prime number.
Therefore, the function `intersection` returns "YES".
