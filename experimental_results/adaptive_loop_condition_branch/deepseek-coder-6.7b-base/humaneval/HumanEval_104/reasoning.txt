The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [15, 33, 1422, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_digit_elements` is initialized as an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 15 is not divisible by 2, so it is appended to the list.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 33 is not divisible by 2, so it is appended to the list.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 1422 is divisible by 2, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 1 is not divisible by 2, so it is appended to the list.

The function returns the sorted list of odd digit elements, which is [1, 33, 15].
