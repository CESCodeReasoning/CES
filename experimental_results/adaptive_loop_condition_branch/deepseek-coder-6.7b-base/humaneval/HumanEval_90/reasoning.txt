The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input and returns the second smallest element in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we need to find the second smallest element in the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The second smallest element in the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 2.
