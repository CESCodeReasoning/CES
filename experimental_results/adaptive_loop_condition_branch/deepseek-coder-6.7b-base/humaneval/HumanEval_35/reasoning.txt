The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list (l[0] = 1).

Iteration 1:
    -The element 2 is greater than the current maximum (m = 1), so m becomes 2.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 3 is greater than the current maximum (m = 2), so m becomes 3.
