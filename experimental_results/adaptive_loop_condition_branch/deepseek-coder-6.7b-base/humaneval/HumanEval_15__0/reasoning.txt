The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string containing the sequence of integers from 0 to n, separated by spaces.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3, we need to generate the sequence of integers from 0 to 3, which is 0, 1, 2, 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3 is "0 1 2 3".
