The function `numerical_letter_grade` is called with ( grades = [4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `letter_grade` is initialized as an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The gpa is 4.0, so the condition `gpa == 4.0` is true.
    -The action `letter_grade.append("A+")` adds "A+" to the `letter_grade` list.
Iteration 2:
    -The gpa is 3, which is not equal to 4.0.
    -The condition `gpa > 3.7` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 3.3` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 3.0` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 2.7` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 2.3` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 2.0` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 1.7` is true.
    -The action `letter_grade.append("C+")` adds "C+" to the `letter_grade` list.
Iteration 3:
    -The gpa is 1.7, which is not equal to 4.0, 3, or any of the other conditions.
    -The condition `gpa > 1.3` is true.
    -The action `letter_grade.append("C-")` adds "C-" to the `letter_grade` list.
Iteration 4:
    -The gpa is 2, which is not equal to 4.0, 3, or any of the other conditions.
    -The condition `gpa > 2.0` is true.
    -The action `letter_grade.append("C+")` adds "C+" to the `letter_grade` list.
Iteration 5:
    -The gpa is 3.5, which is not equal to 4.0, 3, or any of the other conditions.
    -The condition `gpa > 3.0` is true.
    -The action `letter_grade.append("B+")` adds "B+" to the `letter_grade` list.

Therefore, the final output of the function `numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5])` is ["A+", "C-", "C+", "C+", "B+"].
