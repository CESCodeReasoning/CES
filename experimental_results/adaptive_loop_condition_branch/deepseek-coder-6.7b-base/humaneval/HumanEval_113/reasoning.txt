The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['1234567']).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates over the elements of the list `lst`.
First Iteration (arr = '1234567'):
    The expression `int(d)%2==1` evaluates to True for each digit in the string '1234567' if the digit is odd.
    The expression `sum(int(d)%2==1 for d in arr)` evaluates to 4, since there are 4 odd digits in the string '1234567'.
    The string 'the number of odd elements 4n the str4 of the 4nput.' is appended to the list `res`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `res`, which is now ['the number of odd elements 4n the str4 of the 4nput.'].
