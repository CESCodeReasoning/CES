The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 97, shift = 8 ).
The condition `shift > len(s)` is false, so the else branch is taken.
The length of the string `s` is 2, which is less than 8.
Therefore, the function returns the string `s` with the characters shifted to the right by 8 positions.

The string `s` is "97", and the characters are shifted to the right by 8 positions.
The first 8 characters are removed from the end of the string, and the remaining characters are added to the beginning of the string.
The resulting string is "79".

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(97, 8)` is "79".
