The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through the length of the list (since ( len(lst) = 21 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The first branch is taken.
    - `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 3.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The first branch is taken.
    - `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 5.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The first branch is taken.
    - `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 7.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The first branch is taken.
    - `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 181.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The first branch is taken.
    - `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 32.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The first branch is taken.
    - `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 324.
Seventh Iteration (i = 6):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The second branch is taken.
    - `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 4.
Eighth Iteration (i = 7):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The second branch is taken.
    - `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 3.
Ninth Iteration (i = 8):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The second branch is taken.
    - `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 2.
Tenth Iteration (i = 9):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The second branch is taken.
    - `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 3.
Eleventh Iteration (i = 10):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The second branch is taken.
    - `maxx = lst[i
