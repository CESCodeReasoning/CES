The function `move_one_ball` is called with ( arr = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] ).
The first condition is checked:
    - The length of the array is not equal to 0, so the function continues.
The array is sorted and stored in the variable `sorted_array`.
The minimum value in the array is found and stored in the variable `min_value`.
The index of the minimum value is found and stored in the variable `min_index`.
The array is rotated by moving the elements from the index of the minimum value to the end of the array, followed by the elements from the beginning of the array to the index of the minimum value. This is stored in the variable `my_arr`.
The function iterates through the rotated array and checks if each element is equal to the corresponding element in the sorted array.
If any element is not equal to the corresponding element in the sorted array, the function returns False.
If all elements are equal to the corresponding elements in the sorted array, the function returns True.
