The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None.

Iteration 1:
    -The running_max is None, so it becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The running_max is 1, so it becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The running_max is 2, so it becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The running_max is 3, so it becomes 4.
