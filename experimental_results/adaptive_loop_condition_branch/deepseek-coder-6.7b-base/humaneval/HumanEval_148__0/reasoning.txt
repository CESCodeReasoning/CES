The function `bf` is called with ( planet1 = "Earth", planet2 = "Earth" ).
The first condition `planet1 not in planet_names or planet2 not in planet_names or planet1 == planet2` is false, since "Earth" is in the list of planet names.
The second condition `planet1 == planet2` is also false, since "Earth" is not equal to itself.
Therefore, the if branch is not taken, and the function returns an empty tuple.
