The function `below_threshold` is called with ( l = [1, 20, 4, 10], t = 5 ).
The function iterates through each element in the list `l`.

Iteration 1:
    -The element 1 is less than 5, so the function returns False.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 20 is greater than or equal to 5, so the function returns False.
Iteration 3:
    -The element 4 is less than 5, so the function returns False.
Iteration 4:
    -The element 10 is greater than or equal to 5, so the function returns False.
