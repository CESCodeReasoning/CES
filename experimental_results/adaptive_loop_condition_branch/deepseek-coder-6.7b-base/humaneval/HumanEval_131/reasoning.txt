The function `digits` is called with ( n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates through the digits of the number (5).
First Iteration (digit = '5')
   - `digit` is '5', which is an odd number.
   - The condition `int_digit%2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product = product * int_digit` results in `product = 5`.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 1.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function checks if `odd_count` is equal to 0.
   - Since `odd_count` is not equal to 0, the function returns the value of `product`, which is now 5.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digits(5)` is 5.
