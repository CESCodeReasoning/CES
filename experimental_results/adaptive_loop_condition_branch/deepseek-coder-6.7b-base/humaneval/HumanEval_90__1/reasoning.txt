The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input and returns the second smallest element in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [], we need to find the second smallest element in the list.
Since the input list is empty, there is no second smallest element, so the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [] is None.
