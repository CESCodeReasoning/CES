The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "yogurt" ).
The condition `len(word) < 3` is false, so the function proceeds to the next step.
The loop iterates from the last index of the word to the first index (since the step is -1).
First Iteration (i = 4)
   - The character at index 4 is 't', which is not a vowel.
   - The condition `word[i+1] not in vowels` is true.
   - The condition `word[i-1] not in vowels` is true.
   - The condition `(word[i+1] not in vowels) and (word[i-1] not in vowels)` is true.
   - The function returns the character at index 4, which is 't'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `get_closest_vowel("yogurt")` is 't'.
