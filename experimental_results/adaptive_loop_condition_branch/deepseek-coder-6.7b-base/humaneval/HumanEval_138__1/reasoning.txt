The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and returns True if n is equal to the sum of two even numbers and False otherwise.
To determine whether the input 6 is equal to the sum of two even numbers, we need to check if 6 is divisible by 2 and if it is greater than or equal to 8.
Since 6 is divisible by 2 and 6 is greater than or equal to 8, the function returns True.
