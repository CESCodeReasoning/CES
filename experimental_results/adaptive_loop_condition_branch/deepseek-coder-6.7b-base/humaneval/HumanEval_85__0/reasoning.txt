The function add takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 0, 6, 7], we need to sum all even numbers in the list.
The even numbers in the list are 4 and 6, so the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 0, 6, 7] is 10.
