The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest negative integer in the list and the smallest positive integer in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [-1, -3, -5, -6], we need to find the largest negative integer in the list and the smallest positive integer in the list.

The largest negative integer in the list is -1, and the smallest positive integer in the list is -3.

Therefore, the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [-1, -3, -5, -6] is (-1, -3).
