The function filter_by_prefix takes a list of strings and a prefix string as input and returns a list of strings that start with the given prefix.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_prefix on the input [], we need to filter the empty list to find strings that start with the prefix "john".
Since the empty list does not contain any strings that start with the prefix "john", the output of executing the function filter_by_prefix on the input [] is an empty list.
