The function `search` is called with ( lst = [5, 5, 5, 5, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `frq` is initialized to a list of zeros with length equal to the maximum element in the input list `lst` plus 1.

Iteration 1:
    -The value of `frq[5]` is incremented by 1, resulting in `frq = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]`.
Iteration 2:
    -The value of `frq[5]` is incremented by 1, resulting in `frq = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`.
Iteration 3:
    -The value of `frq[5]` is incremented by 1, resulting in `frq = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]`.
Iteration 4:
    -The value of `frq[5]` is incremented by 1, resulting in `frq = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]`.
Iteration 5:
    -The value of `frq[1]` is incremented by 1, resulting in `frq = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4]`.

The loop iterates from 1 to the length of `frq` (excluding the first element, which is not used).

Iteration 1:
    -The value of `i` is 1.
    -The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false, so the `else` block is executed.
Iteration 2:
    -The value of `i` is 2.
    -The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false, so the `else` block is executed.
Iteration 3:
    -The value of `i` is 3.
    -The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false, so the `else` block is executed.
Iteration 4:
    -The value of `i` is 4.
    -The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false, so the `else` block is executed.
Iteration 5:
    -The value of `i` is 5.
    -The condition `frq[i] >= i` is true, so the `if` block is executed.
    -The value of `ans` is set to 5.

The function returns the value of `ans`, which is 5.
