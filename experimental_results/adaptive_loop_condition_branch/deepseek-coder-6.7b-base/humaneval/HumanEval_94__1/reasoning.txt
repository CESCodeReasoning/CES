The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [0, 8, 1, 2, 1, 7] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 5 (since ( len(lst) = 6 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - The condition `i < len(lst)` is true.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken.
    - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - The condition `i < len(lst)` is true.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is true.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The first branch is taken.
    - The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken.
    - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - The condition `i < len(lst)` is true.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken.
    - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - The condition `i < len(lst)` is true.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is true.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The first branch is taken.
    - The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken.
    - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - The condition `i < len(lst)` is true.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken.
    - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - The condition `i < len(lst)` is true.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken.
    - The loop continues to the next iteration.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `maxx`, which is now 8.
