The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [3, 2, -3.5, 0] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list (l[0] = 3).

Iteration 1:
    -The element 2 is greater than the current maximum (m = 3), so m becomes 2.
Iteration 2:
    -The element -3.5 is less than the current maximum (m = 2), so m remains unchanged.
Iteration 3:
    -The element 0 is less than the current maximum (m = 2), so m remains unchanged.
