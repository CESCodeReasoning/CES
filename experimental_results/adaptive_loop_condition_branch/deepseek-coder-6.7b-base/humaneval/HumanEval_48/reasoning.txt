The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'xywyx' ).
Inside the function, a loop iterates over the indices of the input string.

Iteration 1:
    - The character at index 0 ( 'x' ) is not equal to the character at index 4 ( 'x' ).
    - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 2:
    - The character at index 1 ( 'y' ) is equal to the character at index 3 ( 'w' ).
    - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 3:
    - The character at index 2 ( 'w' ) is equal to the character at index 2 ( 'w' ).
    - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 4:
    - The loop ends because the condition ( text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i] ) is not satisfied.
    - The function returns True.
