The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest negative integer in the list and the smallest positive integer in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7], we need to find the largest negative integer in the list and the smallest positive integer in the list.
The largest negative integer in the list is -1, and the smallest positive integer in the list is 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7] is (-1, 1).
