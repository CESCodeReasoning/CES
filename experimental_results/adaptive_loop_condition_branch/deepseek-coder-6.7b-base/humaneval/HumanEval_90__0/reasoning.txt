The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input and returns the second smallest element in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [5, 1, 4, 3, 2], we need to find the second smallest element in the list [5, 1, 4, 3, 2].
The second smallest element in the list [5, 1, 4, 3, 2] is 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [5, 1, 4, 3, 2] is 2.
