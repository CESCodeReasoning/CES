The function filter_by_substring takes a list of strings and a substring as input and returns a new list containing only the strings that contain the substring.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input [], we need to filter out all strings that do not contain the substring "john".
Since the input list is empty, the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input [] is also an empty list.
