The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3 ).
The condition `k == 0` is false, so the else branch is taken.
The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order, resulting in `arr = [-4, -3, 5]`.
The last `k` elements of the sorted array are selected, resulting in `ans = [5]`.
The function returns `ans`, which is `[5]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3)` is `[5]`.
