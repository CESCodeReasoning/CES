The function `do_algebra` is called with (operator = ['//', '*'], operand = [7, 3, 4]).
The function `do_algebra` takes two arguments: `operator` and `operand`.
`operator` is a list of strings that represent the operators to be applied to the operands.
`operand` is a list of integers that represent the operands to be used in the calculation.

The function `do_algebra` returns the result of applying the operators in `operator` to the operands in `operand`.

The function `do_algebra` uses the `zip` function to iterate over the `operator` and `operand` lists simultaneously.

The `zip` function returns an iterator of tuples, where each tuple contains the corresponding elements from the two lists.

In this case, the `zip` function returns an iterator of tuples, where each tuple contains the corresponding elements from the `operator` and `operand` lists.

The `zip` function is used to iterate over the `operator` and `operand` lists simultaneously.
