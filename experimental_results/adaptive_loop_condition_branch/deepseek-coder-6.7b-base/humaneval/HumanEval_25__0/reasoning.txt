The function `factorize` is called with ( n = 3 * 2 * 3 ).
The function `factorize` returns a list of prime factors of ( n ).
The function `factorize` initializes an empty list `fact` to store the prime factors.
The function `factorize` initializes a variable `i` to 2.
The function `factorize` enters a loop that iterates from 2 through the square root of ( n ) + 1.
First Iteration (i = 2):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=2
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `i` is incremented by 1.
Second Iteration (i = 3):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=3
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `i` is incremented by 1.
Third Iteration (i = 4):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=4
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `i` is incremented by 1.
Fourth Iteration (i = 5):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=5
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `i` is incremented by 1.
Fifth Iteration (i = 6):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=6
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `i` is incremented by 1.
Sixth Iteration (i = 7):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=7
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `i` is incremented by 1.
Seventh Iteration (i = 8):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=8
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `i` is incremented by 1.
Eighth Iteration (i = 9):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=9
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `i` is incremented by 1.
Ninth Iteration (i = 10):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=10
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `i` is incremented by 1.
Tenth Iteration (i = 11):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=11
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `i` is incremented by 1.
After the loop completes, the function returns the list `fact`, which contains the prime factors of ( n ).
