The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '04-2003' ).
The function first strips the leading and trailing whitespace from the input string using the `strip()` method.
Then, it splits the input string into three parts using the `split('-')` method.
The first part is assigned to the `month` variable, the second part is assigned to the `day` variable, and the third part is assigned to the `year` variable.
The `month`, `day`, and `year` variables are then converted to integers using the `int()` function.

Next, the function checks if the `month` variable is less than 1 or greater than 12. If it is, the function returns False.

If the `month` variable is between 1 and 12, the function checks if the `day` variable is less than 1 or greater than 31. If it is, the function returns False.

If the `month` variable is 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, or 12, the function checks if the `day` variable is less than 1 or greater than 31. If it is, the function returns False.

If the `month` variable is 4, 6, 9, or 11, the function checks if the `day` variable is less than 1 or greater than 30. If it is, the function returns False.

If the `month` variable is 2, the function checks if the `day` variable is less than 1 or greater than 29. If it is, the function returns False.

If all the checks pass, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('04-2003')` is False.
