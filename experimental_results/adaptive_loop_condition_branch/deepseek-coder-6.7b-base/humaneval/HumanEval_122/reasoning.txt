The function add_elements takes an array arr and an integer k as input and returns the sum of the first k elements of the array.
To determine the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99] and 3, we need to add the first 3 elements of the array.
The first 3 elements of the array are 1, -2, and -3.
The sum of these elements is 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99] and 3 is 0.
