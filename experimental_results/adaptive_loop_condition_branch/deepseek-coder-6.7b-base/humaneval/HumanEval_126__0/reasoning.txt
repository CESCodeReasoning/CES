The function `is_sorted` is called with ( lst = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `count_digit` is initialized with the count of each element in the list.
The loop iterates from 0 through 3 (since ( len(lst) = 4 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    lst[i] = 1, `count_digit[i] += 1` updates the count of 1 to 1.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    lst[i] = 2, `count_digit[i] += 1` updates the count of 2 to 1.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
    lst[i] = 3, `count_digit[i] += 1` updates the count of 3 to 1.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
    lst[i] = 4, `count_digit[i] += 1` updates the count of 4 to 1.
After the loop completes, the condition ( any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst) ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition ( all(lst[i - 1] <= lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst))) ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `True` as the output.
