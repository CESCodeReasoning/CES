The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [4, 3, 2, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None.

Iteration 1:
    -The running_max is None, so it becomes 4.
Iteration 2:
    -The running_max is 4, so it becomes 4.
Iteration 3:
    -The running_max is 4, so it becomes 4.
Iteration 4:
    -The running_max is 4, so it becomes 4.
