The function `is_sorted` is called with ( lst = [3, 2, 1] ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `count_digit` is initialized with keys as the elements of the list `lst` and values as 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 2 (since ( len(lst) = 3 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    lst[i] = 3, `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit[3]` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    lst[i] = 2, `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit[2]` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Third Iteration (i = 2)
    lst[i] = 1, `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit[1]` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst) ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `False` as the output.
