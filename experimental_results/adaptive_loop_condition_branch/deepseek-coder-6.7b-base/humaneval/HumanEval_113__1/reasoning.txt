The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['271', '137', '314']).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`.
First Iteration (arr = '271'):
    The sum of the odd digits in '271' is 2.
    The string "the number of odd elements 2n the str2 of the 2nput." is appended to `res`.
Second Iteration (arr = '137'):
    The sum of the odd digits in '137' is 2.
    The string "the number of odd elements 2n the str2 of the 2nput." is appended to `res`.
Third Iteration (arr = '314'):
    The sum of the odd digits in '314' is 2.
    The string "the number of odd elements 2n the str2 of the 2nput." is appended to `res`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `res`, which is now ['the number of odd elements 2n the str2 of the 2nput.', 'the number of odd elements 2n the str2 of the 2nput.', 'the number of odd elements 2n the str2 of the 2nput.'].
