The function iscube takes an integer a as input and returns True if a is a perfect cube, and False otherwise.
To determine whether a is a perfect cube, we first take the absolute value of a.
Then, we calculate the cube root of a and round it to the nearest integer.
Finally, we check if the cube of the rounded cube root is equal to a.
If the cube of the rounded cube root is equal to a, then a is a perfect cube, and the function returns True.
Otherwise, a is not a perfect cube, and the function returns False.
