The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = '[[]]' ).
Inside the function, two empty lists are initialized: `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index`.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '[' is found at index 0, so it is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '[' is found at index 1, so it is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ']' is found at index 2, so it is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ']' is found at index 3, so it is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.

After the loop, the `closing_bracket_index` list is reversed.

Iteration 1:
    -The index 3 is less than the length of `closing_bracket_index` (4) and is less than the element at index 0 of `closing_bracket_index` (2).
    -The condition is true, so `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The index 2 is less than the length of `closing_bracket_index` (4) and is less than the element at index 1 of `closing_bracket_index` (3).
    -The condition is true, so `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 1.

After the loop, `cnt` is 2, which is greater than or equal to 2, so the function returns True.
