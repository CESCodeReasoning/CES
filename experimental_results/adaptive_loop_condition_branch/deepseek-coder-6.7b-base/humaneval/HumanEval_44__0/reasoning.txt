The function `change_base` is called with ( x = 234, base = 2 ).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to an empty string.
First Iteration:
    - x = 234, x % base = 0, ret = "0"
    - x //= base updates x to 117 ( 234 // 2 = 117 )
Second Iteration:
    - x = 117, x % base = 1, ret = "10"
    - x //= base updates x to 58 ( 117 // 2 = 58 )
Third Iteration:
    - x = 58, x % base = 0, ret = "010"
    - x //= base updates x to 29 ( 58 // 2 = 29 )
Fourth Iteration:
    - x = 29, x % base = 1, ret = "1010"
    - x //= base updates x to 14 ( 29 // 2 = 14 )
Fifth Iteration:
    - x = 14, x % base = 0, ret = "01010"
    - x //= base updates x to 7 ( 14 // 2 = 7 )
Sixth Iteration:
    - x = 7, x % base = 1, ret = "101010"
    - x //= base updates x to 3 ( 7 // 2 = 3 )
Seventh Iteration:
    - x = 3, x % base = 1, ret = "1010101"
    - x //= base updates x to 1 ( 3 // 2 = 1 )
Eighth Iteration:
    - x = 1, x % base = 1, ret = "10101011"
    - x //= base updates x to 0 ( 1 // 2 = 0 )
x is now 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `ret`, which is now "10101011".
