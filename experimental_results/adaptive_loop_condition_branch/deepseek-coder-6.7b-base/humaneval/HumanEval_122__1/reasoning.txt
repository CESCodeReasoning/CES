The function add_elements takes an array arr and an integer k as input and returns the sum of the first k elements of the array.
To determine the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9] and 4, we need to add the first 4 elements of the array.
The first 4 elements of the array are [11,21,3,90].
The first 4 elements of the array that have a length of 2 or less are [11,21,3].
Therefore, the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9] and 4 is 16.
