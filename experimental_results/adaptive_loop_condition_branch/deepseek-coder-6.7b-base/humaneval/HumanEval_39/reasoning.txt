The function `prime_fib` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, a variable `f` is initialized to [0, 1].
The loop iterates until the condition `n == 0` is met.
First Iteration (f = [0, 1]):
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is false.
    - The condition `n == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues.
Second Iteration (f = [0, 1, 1]):
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is false.
    - The condition `n == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues.
Third Iteration (f = [0, 1, 1, 2]):
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is false.
    - The condition `n == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues.
Fourth Iteration (f = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]):
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is false.
    - The condition `n == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues.
Fifth Iteration (f = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]):
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is true.
    - The condition `n == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues.
Sixth Iteration (f = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]):
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is false.
    - The condition `n == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues.
Seventh Iteration (f = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]):
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is false.
    - The condition `n == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues.
Eighth Iteration (f = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]):
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is false.
    - The condition `n == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues.
Ninth Iteration (f = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]):
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is false.
    - The condition `n == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues.
Tenth Iteration (f = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]):
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is false.
    - The condition `n == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues.
Eleventh Iteration (f = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]):
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is false.
    - The condition `n == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues.
Twelfth Iteration (f = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144]):
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is false.
    - The condition `n == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues.
Thirteenth Iteration (f = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233]):
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is false.
