The function `largest_divisor` is called with ( n = 49 ).
The function iterates through the range of numbers from 49 to 1 in reverse order.

Iteration 1:
    -The current number is 49.
    -Since 49 is divisible by 1, the function returns 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The current number is 48.
    -Since 48 is divisible by 2, the function returns 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The current number is 47.
    -Since 47 is not divisible by 3, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 4:
    -The current number is 46.
    -Since 46 is not divisible by 4, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 5:
    -The current number is 45.
    -Since 45 is not divisible by 5, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 6:
    -The current number is 44.
    -Since 44 is not divisible by 6, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 7:
    -The current number is 43.
    -Since 43 is not divisible by 7, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 8:
    -The current number is 42.
    -Since 42 is not divisible by 8, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 9:
    -The current number is 41.
    -Since 41 is not divisible by 9, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 10:
    -The current number is 40.
    -Since 40 is not divisible by 10, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 11:
    -The current number is 39.
    -Since 39 is not divisible by 11, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 12:
    -The current number is 38.
    -Since 38 is not divisible by 12, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 13:
    -The current number is 37.
    -Since 37 is not divisible by 13, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 14:
    -The current number is 36.
    -Since 36 is not divisible by 14, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 15:
    -The current number is 35.
    -Since 35 is not divisible by 15, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 16:
    -The current number is 34.
    -Since 34 is not divisible by 16, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 17:
    -The current number is 33.
    -Since 33 is not divisible by 17, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 18:
    -The current number is 32.
    -Since 32 is not divisible by 18, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 19:
    -The current number is 31.
    -Since 31 is not divisible by 19, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 20:
    -The current number is 30.
    -Since 30 is not divisible by 20, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 21:
    -The current number is 29.
    -Since 29 is not divisible by 21, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 22:
    -The current number is 28.
    -Since 28 is not divisible by 22, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 23:
    -The current number is 27.
    -Since 27 is not divisible by 23, the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 24:
    -The current number is 26.
    -Since 26 is not divisible by 24,
