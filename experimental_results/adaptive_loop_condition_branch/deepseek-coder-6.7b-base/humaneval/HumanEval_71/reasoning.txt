The function `triangle_area` is called with ( a = 3, b = 4, c = 5 ).
The condition `a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a` is false.
The condition `b + c <= a` is false.
The condition `a + c <= b` is false.
The condition `a + b <= c` is true.
The if branch is taken and the method returns the area of the triangle.

Therefore, the final output of the function `triangle_area(3, 4, 5)` is 6.
