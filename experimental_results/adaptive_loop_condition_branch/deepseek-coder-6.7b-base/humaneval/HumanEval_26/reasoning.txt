The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements of the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5], we need to remove the duplicates from the input list.
The input list contains the elements 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, and 5.
The first element 1 is unique, so it is added to the output list.
The second element 2 is not unique, so it is not added to the output list.
The third element 3 is not unique, so it is not added to the output list.
The fourth element 2 is not unique, so it is not added to the output list.
The fifth element 4 is unique, so it is added to the output list.
The sixth element 3 is not unique, so it is not added to the output list.
The seventh element 5 is unique, so it is added to the output list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5] is [1, 4, 5].
