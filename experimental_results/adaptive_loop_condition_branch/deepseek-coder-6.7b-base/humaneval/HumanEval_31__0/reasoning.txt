The function `is_prime` is called with ( n = 5 * 17 ).

The first condition `n < 2` is false, so the function proceeds to the next condition.

The loop iterates from 2 through ( n - 1 ).

First Iteration (k = 2)
   - `k` is 2, which satisfies ( 2 <= k < (n - 1) ).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Second Iteration (k = 3)
   - `k` is 3, which still satisfies ( 3 <= k < (n - 1) ).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Third Iteration (k = 4)
   - `k` is 4, which now satisfies ( 4 <= k < (n - 1) ).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is true (since 5 * 17 = 85 and 85 % 4 = 1).
   - The loop terminates, and the function returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_prime(5 * 17)` is False.
