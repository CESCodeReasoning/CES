The function solution takes a list of integers lst as input and returns the sum of all odd integers in the list that have even indices.
To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [2, 4, 8], we need to find the sum of all odd integers in the list that have even indices.
The first element in the list has index 0, which is even. The second element has index 1, which is odd. The third element has index 2, which is even.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [2, 4, 8] is 4.
