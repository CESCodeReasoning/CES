The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'a b c d g' ).
Inside the function, a variable `dict1` is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The input string is split into a list of words using the `split` method.

Iteration 1:
    -The word 'a' occurs 1 time in the list, so it is added to the dictionary with a count of 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The word 'b' occurs 1 time in the list, so it is added to the dictionary with a count of 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The word 'c' occurs 1 time in the list, so it is added to the dictionary with a count of 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The word 'd' occurs 1 time in the list, so it is added to the dictionary with a count of 1.
Iteration 5:
    -The word 'g' occurs 1 time in the list, so it is added to the dictionary with a count of 1.

The function returns the dictionary `dict1`, which contains the words and their counts.
