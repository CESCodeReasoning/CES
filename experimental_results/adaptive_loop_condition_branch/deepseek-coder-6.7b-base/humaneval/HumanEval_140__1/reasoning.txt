The function `fix_spaces` is called with ( text = "Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow" ).
The variable `new_text` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates over each character in the input string.
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - The character at index 0 is a space.
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 1.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - The character at index 1 is a space.
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 2.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - The character at index 2 is a space.
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 3.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - The character at index 3 is a space.
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 4.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - The character at index 4 is a space.
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 5.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - The character at index 5 is a space.
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 6.
Seventh Iteration (i = 6):
    - The character at index 6 is a space.
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 7.
Eighth Iteration (i = 7):

    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 8.
Ninth Iteration (i = 8):
    - The character at index 8 is a space.
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 9.
Tenth Iteration (i = 9):
