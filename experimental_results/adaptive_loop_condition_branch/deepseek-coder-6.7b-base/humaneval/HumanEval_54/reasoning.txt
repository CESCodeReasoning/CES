The function same_chars takes two strings s0 and s1 as input and returns True if the two strings have the same characters, and False otherwise.
To determine if the two strings have the same characters, we need to compare the sets of characters in the two strings.
The set of characters in the string "eabcdzzzz" is {'e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'z'}, and the set of characters in the string "dddzzzzzzzddeddabc" is {'d', 'e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'z'}.
Since the two sets are not equal, the function same_chars returns False.
