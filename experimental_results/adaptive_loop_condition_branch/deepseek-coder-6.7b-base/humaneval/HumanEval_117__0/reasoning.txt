The function select_words(s, n) takes a string s and an integer n as its parameters.
The function splits the string s into a list of words using the split() method.
The outer loop iterates through each word in the list of words.
The inner loop iterates through each character in the word.
If the character is not a vowel, the n_consonants variable is incremented by 1.
If the n_consonants variable is equal to n, the word is appended to the result list.
The function returns the result list.
