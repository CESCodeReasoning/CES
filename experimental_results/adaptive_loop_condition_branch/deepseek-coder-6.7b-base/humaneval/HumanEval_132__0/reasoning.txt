The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = '[][][[]]' ).
Inside the function, two empty lists are initialized: `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index`.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '[' is found, so it is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character ']' is found, so it is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '[' is found, so it is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ']' is found, so it is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '[' is found, so it is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ']' is found, so it is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.

After the loop, `closing_bracket_index` is reversed.

Iteration 1:
    -The index of the first opening bracket is 0, which is less than the index of the first closing bracket (6), so the condition is true.
    -The `cnt` variable is incremented by 1.
    -The `i` variable is incremented by 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The index of the second opening bracket is 2, which is less than the index of the second closing bracket (5), so the condition is true.
    -The `cnt` variable is incremented by 1.
    -The `i` variable is incremented by 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The index of the third opening bracket is 4, which is less than the index of the third closing bracket (4), so the condition is true.
    -The `cnt` variable is incremented by 1.
    -The `i` variable is incremented by 1.

After the loop, the function returns `True`, as `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.
