The function `solve` is called with ( s = "#a@C" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '#' is not an alphabet, so flg remains 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'a' is an alphabet, so flg becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '@' is not an alphabet, so flg remains 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'C' is an alphabet, so flg becomes 1.

The function returns the reversed string if flg is 0, otherwise it returns the original string.
