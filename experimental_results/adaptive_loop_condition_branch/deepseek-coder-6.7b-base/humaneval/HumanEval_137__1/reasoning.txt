The function `compare_one` is called with ( a = "1", b = "2" ).
The first if statement checks if `temp_a` is an instance of `str`. Since `temp_a` is a string, the condition is true.
The `temp_a` is then replaced with `temp_a.replace(',', '.')`, which replaces all commas with periods.
The second if statement checks if `temp_b` is an instance of `str`. Since `temp_b` is a string, the condition is true.
The `temp_b` is then replaced with `temp_b.replace(',', '.')`, which replaces all commas with periods.
The third if statement checks if `float(temp_a)` is equal to `float(temp_b)`. Since `float(temp_a)` is not equal to `float(temp_b)`, the condition is false.
The function returns `a` if `float(temp_a)` is greater than `float(temp_b)`, otherwise it returns `b`. Since `float(temp_a)` is greater than `float(temp_b)`, the function returns `a`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one("1", "2")` is "1".
