The function `median` is called with ( l = [8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7] ).
The list `l` is sorted to [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 9].
The length of the list is 7, which is odd.
The condition `len(l) % 2 == 1` is true.
The if branch is taken, and the method returns the middle element of the sorted list, which is 8.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7])` is 8.
