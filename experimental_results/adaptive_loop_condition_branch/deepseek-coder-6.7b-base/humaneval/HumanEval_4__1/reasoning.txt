The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers.

To determine the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers, we first need to calculate the mean of the numbers. We can do this by summing up all the numbers and dividing by the number of numbers.

Next, we need to calculate the absolute deviation of each number from the mean. The absolute deviation of a number x is the absolute value of the difference between x and the mean.

Finally, we need to calculate the mean of the absolute deviations. We can do this by summing up all the absolute deviations and dividing by the number of numbers.

The mean absolute deviation of the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] is 1.4142135623730951.
