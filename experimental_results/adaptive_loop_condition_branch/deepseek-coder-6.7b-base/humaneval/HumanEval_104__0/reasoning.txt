The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [135, 103, 31] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `odd_digit_elements` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The integer 135 is not divisible by 2, so it is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 2:
    -The integer 103 is not divisible by 2, so it is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 3:
    -The integer 31 is divisible by 2, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.

The function returns the sorted list `odd_digit_elements`, which is [135, 103].
