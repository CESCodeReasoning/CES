The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the positive odd numbers in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [], we need to find the squares of the positive odd numbers in the list.
Since the input list is empty, there are no positive odd numbers in the list, so the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [] is 0.
