The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Wow' ).
The length of the string is 3.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of the string is not 0 or 1, so the condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is false.
Iteration 2:
    -The length of the string is not divisible by 2, so the condition `l % i == 0` is false.
Iteration 3:
    -The length of the string is not divisible by 3, so the condition `l % i == 0` is false.

Therefore, the function returns True.
