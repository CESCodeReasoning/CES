The function max_fill takes a grid of integers and a capacity as input and returns the maximum number of times the capacity can be filled in the grid.
To determine the output of executing the function max_fill on the input [[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], capacity 2, we need to calculate the number of times the capacity 2 can be filled in the grid.
The grid is a 2D array of integers. We need to calculate the sum of each row and divide it by the capacity 2. The result is the number of times the capacity 2 can be filled in each row.
We then need to round up the result to the nearest integer and add it to the total.
The total is the maximum number of times the capacity 2 can be filled in the grid.
