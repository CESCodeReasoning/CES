The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string containing the sequence of integers from 0 to n, separated by spaces.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 0, we need to generate the sequence of integers from 0 to 0, which is just 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 0 is "0".
