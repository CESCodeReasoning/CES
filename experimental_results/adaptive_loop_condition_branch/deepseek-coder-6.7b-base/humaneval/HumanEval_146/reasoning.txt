The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [5, -2, 1, -5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 5 is greater than 10, so it is checked for odd digits.
    -The first digit of 5 is 5, which is not an odd digit.
    -The last digit of 5 is 5, which is not an odd digit.
    -Therefore, the number 5 does not satisfy the conditions and is not counted.
Iteration 2:
    -The number -2 is less than or equal to 10, so it is not counted.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 1 is greater than 10, so it is checked for odd digits.
    -The first digit of 1 is 1, which is an odd digit.
    -The last digit of 1 is 1, which is an odd digit.
    -Therefore, the number 1 satisfies the conditions and is counted.
Iteration 4:
    -The number -5 is less than or equal to 10, so it is not counted.
