The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The function first creates a list A of n elements, where each element is the square of the index minus the index plus 1.
The function then iterates through each element in the list A to find all possible triples that add up to a multiple of 3.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4.
    - `k` in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4.
    - A[i]=1, A[j]=2, A[k]=3: (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 = 6, the if branch is not taken.
    - A[i]=1, A[j]=2, A[k]=4: (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 = 7, the if branch is not taken.
    - A[i]=1, A[j]=2, A[k]=5: (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 = 8, the if branch is not taken.
    - A[i]=1, A[j]=3, A[k]=4: (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 = 7, the if branch is not taken.
    - A[i]=1, A[j]=3, A[k]=5: (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 = 8, the if branch is not taken.
    - A[i]=1, A[j]=4, A[k]=5: (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 = 9, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4.
    - `k` in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 3, 4.
    - A[i]=2, A[j]=3, A[k]=4: (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 = 9, the if branch is not taken.
    - A[i]=2, A[j]=3, A[k]=5: (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 = 10, the if branch is not taken.
    - A[i]=2, A[j]=4, A[k]=5: (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 = 11, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4.
    - `k` in the inner loop is 3, 4.
    - A[i]=3, A[j]=4, A[k]=5: (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 = 12, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4.
    - `k` in the inner loop is 4.
    - A[i]=4, A[j]=5, A[k]=5: (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 = 13, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - `k` in the inner loop is 5.
    - A[i]=5, A[j]=5, A[k]=5: (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 = 15, the if branch is taken. Append (5, 5, 5) to ans.
