The function `fib4` is called with ( n = 5 ).
The condition ( n < 4 ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The loop iterates from 4 through 5 (since ( n + 1 = 6 )).
First Iteration (i = 4):
    results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates results to [0, 0, 2, 0, 4].
Second Iteration (i = 5):
    results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates results to [0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 8].
After the loop completes, the function returns the last element of the results list, which is 8 as the output.
