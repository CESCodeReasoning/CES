The function `get_odd_collatz` is called with ( n = 14 ).
The condition `n%2==0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
The else branch is taken. The variable `odd_collatz` is initialized to [14].
The loop iterates from 14 to 1 (since ( n = 14 )).
First Iteration (n = 14):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=14
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `n = n*3 + 1` updates `n` to 42 ( 14 * 3 + 1 = 42 ).
Second Iteration (n = 42):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=42
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `n = n*3 + 1` updates `n` to 126 ( 42 * 3 + 1 = 126 ).
Third Iteration (n = 126):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=126
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `n = n*3 + 1` updates `n` to 378 ( 126 * 3 + 1 = 378 ).
Fourth Iteration (n = 378):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=378
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `n = n*3 + 1` updates `n` to 1134 ( 378 * 3 + 1 = 1134 ).
Fifth Iteration (n = 1134):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=1134
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `n = n*3 + 1` updates `n` to 3402 ( 1134 * 3 + 1 = 3402 ).
Sixth Iteration (n = 3402):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=3402
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `n = n*3 + 1` updates `n` to 10206 ( 3402 * 3 + 1 = 10206 ).
Seventh Iteration (n = 10206):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=10206
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `n = n*3 + 1` updates `n` to 30618 ( 10206 * 3 + 1 = 30618 ).
Eighth Iteration (n = 30618):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=30618
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `n = n*3 + 1` updates `n` to 92854 ( 30618 * 3 + 1 = 92854 ).
Ninth Iteration (n = 92854):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=92854
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `n = n*3 + 1` updates `n` to 278562 ( 92854 * 3 + 1 = 278562 ).
Tenth Iteration (n = 278562):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=278562
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken.
