The function reverse_delete takes two arguments: s and c. The function returns a tuple containing two elements: the first element is the string s with all characters in c removed, and the second element is a boolean value indicating whether the resulting string is a palindrome.

To determine the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcde", we need to remove all characters in "ae" from the string "abcde".

The resulting string after removing all characters in "ae" is "bcd".

To determine whether the resulting string "bcd" is a palindrome, we need to check if the string is equal to its reverse.

The reverse of the string "bcd" is "dcb".

Therefore, the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcde" is ("bcd", False).
