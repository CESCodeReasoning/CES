The function `move_one_ball` is called with ( arr = [4, 3, 1, 2] ).

The first condition is checked:
    - The length of the array is not equal to 0, so the function continues.

The array is sorted and stored in the variable `sorted_array`.

The minimum value in the array is found and stored in the variable `min_value`.

The index of the minimum value is found and stored in the variable `min_index`.

The array is rotated by moving the elements from the index of the minimum value to the end of the array, followed by the elements from the beginning of the array to the index of the minimum value. This is stored in the variable `my_arr`.

The function iterates through the array using a for loop.

In the first iteration, the condition is checked:
    - The element at index 0 of `my_arr` is not equal to the element at index 0 of `sorted_array`.
    - The condition is true, so the function returns False.

The function returns False, indicating that the array cannot be rotated to match the sorted array.
