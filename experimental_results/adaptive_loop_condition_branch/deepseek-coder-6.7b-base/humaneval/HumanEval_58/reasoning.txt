The function common(l1, l2) takes two lists as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the first list to compare it against the elements in the second list.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by e1 in the outer loop, compare it with every element in the second list.
First Iteration (e1=1):
    - `e1` is 1, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - 1 is not equal to any of the elements in the second list.
Second Iteration (e1=4):
    - `e1` is 4, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - 4 is not equal to any of the elements in the second list.
Third Iteration (e1=3):
    - `e1` is 3, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - 3 is equal to 5, 1, 5, 653. Add 3 to the set ret.
Forth Iteration (e1=34):
    - `e1` is 34, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - 34 is not equal to any of the elements in the second list.
Fifth Iteration (e1=653):
    - `e1` is 653, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - 653 is equal to 1, 5, 653. Add 653 to the set ret.
Sixth Iteration (e1=2):
    - `e1` is 2, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - 2 is not equal to any of the elements in the second list.
Seventh Iteration (e1=5):
    - `e1` is 5, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - 5 is equal to 5, 1, 5, 653. Add 5 to the set ret.
Eighth Iteration (e1=5):
    - `e1` is 5, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - 5 is equal to 5, 1, 5, 653. Add 5 to the set ret.
Ninth Iteration (e1=9):
    - `e1` is 9, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - 9 is not equal to any of the elements in the second list.
Tenth Iteration (e1=121):
    - `e1` is 121, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - 121 is not equal to any of the elements in the second list.
No more elements to compare.
