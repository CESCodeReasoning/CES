The function `sort_even` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3] ).
The list `l` is sliced into two sublists: `evens` and `odds`.
`evens` contains the even-indexed elements of `l`, while `odds` contains the odd-indexed elements.
`evens` is sorted in ascending order.
The function then iterates over the elements of `evens` and `odds` using the `zip` function.
The `zip` function combines the elements of `evens` and `odds` into tuples, and the loop iterates over these tuples.
For each tuple (e, o), the function appends e to `ans` and then appends o to `ans`.
After the loop completes, if the length of `evens` is greater than the length of `odds`, the function appends the last element of `evens` to `ans`.
The function returns `ans` as the output.
