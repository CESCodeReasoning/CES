The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input and returns a new string that is the result of shuffling the characters in each word of s.
To determine the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input "Hi", we need to shuffle the characters in each word of "Hi".
The first word is "Hi", which has two characters, so we need to shuffle them.
The shuffled characters of "Hi" are "Hi", which is the same as the original word.
Therefore, the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input "Hi" is "Hi".
