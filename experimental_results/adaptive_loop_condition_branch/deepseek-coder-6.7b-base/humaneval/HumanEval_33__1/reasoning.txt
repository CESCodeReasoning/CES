The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a new list with the same elements as l, but with every third element sorted in ascending order.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10], we need to sort every third element of the input list in ascending order.
The first third element of the input list is [5, 8, -12], which is sorted to [-12, 5, 8].
The second third element of the input list is [4, 23, 2], which is sorted to [2, 4, 23].
The third third element of the input list is [3, 11, 12], which is sorted to [3, 11, 12].
The fourth third element of the input list is [-10], which is already sorted.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10] is [-12, 5, 8, 2, 4, 23, 3, 11, 12, -10].
