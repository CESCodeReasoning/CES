The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list of numbers where each number is rescaled to be between 0 and 1.
To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0], we need to find the minimum and maximum values in the input list.
The minimum value is 1.0 and the maximum value is 5.0.
We then divide each number in the input list by the difference between the maximum and minimum values to rescale the numbers to be between 0 and 1.
The output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0] is [0.6, 0.2, 1.0, 0.4, 0.8].
