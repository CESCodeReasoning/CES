The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 3, b = 7 ).
First Iteration:
    - a = 3, b = 7, a % b = 3.
    -`a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 7 and `b` to 3.
Second Iteration:
    - a = 7, b = 3, a % b = 1.
    -`a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 3 and `b` to 1.
b is 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 3.
