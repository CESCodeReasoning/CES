The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers that have been rescaled to the range [0, 1].
To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], we need to rescale each number in the input list to the range [0, 1].

To rescale a number x to the range [0, 1], we first need to find the minimum and maximum values in the input list.
The minimum value is 1.0 and the maximum value is 5.0.

We can then rescale each number in the input list by subtracting the minimum value from it and then dividing the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
For example, to rescale the number 2.0 to the range [0, 1], we subtract 1.0 from it to get 1.0, and then divide the result by 4.0 to get 0.25.

Therefore, the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] is [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0].
