The function `special_factorial` is called with (n = 7).
Inside the function, two variables `fact_i` and `special_fact` are initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 1 through 7 (since (n = 7)).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    fact_i = 1 * 1 = 1
    special_fact = 1 * 1 = 1
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    fact_i = 1 * 2 = 2
    special_fact = 1 * 2 = 2
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    fact_i = 2 * 3 = 6
    special_fact = 2 * 6 = 12
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    fact_i = 6 * 4 = 24
    special_fact = 12 * 24 = 288
Fifth Iteration (i = 5):
    fact_i = 24 * 5 = 120
    special_fact = 288 * 120 = 34560
Sixth Iteration (i = 6):
    fact_i = 120 * 6 = 720
    special_fact = 34560 * 720 = 243290240
Seventh Iteration (i = 7):
    fact_i = 720 * 7 = 5040
    special_fact = 243290240 * 5040 = 129062912000
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `special_fact`, which is now 129062912000.
