The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a new list with the same elements as l, but with every third element sorted in ascending order.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], we need to sort the third element of each triplet in the input list.
The third element of the first triplet is 5, the third element of the second triplet is -5, the third element of the third triplet is 3, and so on.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] is [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10].
