The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [0] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `result` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The index `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 % 3 == 0 ).
    -The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
    -Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` appends the square of the element at index `i` (0**2 = 0) to `result`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_squares([0])` is 0.
