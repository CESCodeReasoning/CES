The function count_distinct_characters takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string.
To determine the number of distinct characters in the string 'aaaaAAAAaaaa', we need to count the number of unique characters in the string.
Since the string contains only lowercase letters, we can convert the string to lowercase and use a set to count the number of unique characters.
The set function returns a set of unique characters in the string, so the length of the set is the number of distinct characters in the string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function count_distinct_characters on the input 'aaaaAAAAaaaa' is 2.
