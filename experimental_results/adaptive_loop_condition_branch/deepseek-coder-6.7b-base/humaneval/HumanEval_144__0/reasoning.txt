The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "2/4", n = "8/4" ).
The function splits the input strings `x` and `n` into numerator and denominator parts.
The numerator and denominator parts are then converted to integers.
The numerator of `x` is multiplied by the denominator of `n`, and the result is stored in `numerator`.
The denominator of `x` is multiplied by the denominator of `n`, and the result is stored in `denom`.
The condition `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` is checked.
If the condition is true, the function returns True.
Otherwise, it returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("2/4", "8/4")` is True.
