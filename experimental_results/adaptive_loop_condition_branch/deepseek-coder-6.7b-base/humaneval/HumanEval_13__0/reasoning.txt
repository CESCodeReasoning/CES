The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 10, b = 15 ).
First Iteration:
    - a = 10, b = 15, a % b = 10.
    -`a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 15 ( 15, 10 = 15 ) and `b` to 10 ( 10, 10 = 0 ).
Second Iteration:
    - a = 15, b = 10, a % b = 5.
    -`a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 10 ( 10, 5 = 10 ) and `b` to 5 ( 5, 5 = 0 ).
b is 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 10.
