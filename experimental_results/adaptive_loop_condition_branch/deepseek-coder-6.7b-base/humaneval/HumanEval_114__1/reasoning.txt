The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [0, 10, 20, 1000000] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The value of `s` is updated to 0 - 0 = 0.
    -The value of `max_sum` is updated to max(0, 0) = 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The value of `s` is updated to 0 - 10 = -10.
    -The value of `max_sum` is updated to max(0, -10) = -10.
Iteration 3:
    -The value of `s` is updated to -10 - 20 = -30.
    -The value of `max_sum` is updated to max(-10, -30) = -10.
Iteration 4:
    -The value of `s` is updated to -30 - 1000000 = -1000030.
    -The value of `max_sum` is updated to max(-10, -1000030) = -10.

The value of `max_sum` is -10.

If `max_sum` is equal to 0, then the function returns the maximum negative value in `nums`.

Since `max_sum` is not equal to 0, the function returns the negative of `max_sum`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([0, 10, 20, 1000000])` is -10.
