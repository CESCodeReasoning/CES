The function derivative takes a list of numbers xs as input and returns a list of numbers.
The function returns the derivative of the input list of numbers.
To determine the derivative of the input list of numbers, we need to calculate the derivative of each number in the input list.
The derivative of a number x is the product of its index i and the number x.
Therefore, the derivative of the input list of numbers is a list of numbers where each number is the product of its index i and the number x.
The derivative of the input list of numbers is [1 * 1, 2 * 2, 3 * 3, 4 * 4, 5 * 5].
The derivative of the input list of numbers is [1, 4, 9, 16, 25].
