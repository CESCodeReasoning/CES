The function `is_sorted` is called with ( lst = [5] ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `count_digit` is initialized with keys as the elements of the list `lst` and values as 0.
The loop iterates through the list `lst`.
First Iteration (i = 5):
    count_digit[i] = 0, `count_digit[i]+=1` updates `count_digit[i]` to 1.
After the loop completes, the condition ( any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst) ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition ( all(lst[i-1] <= lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst))) ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `True` as the output.
