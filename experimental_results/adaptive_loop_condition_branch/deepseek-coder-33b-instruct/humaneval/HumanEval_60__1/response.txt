[REASONING]
The function sum_to_n takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of all integers from 0 to n.
To determine the output of executing the function sum_to_n on the input 100, we need to sum all integers from 0 to 100.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sum_to_n on the input 100 is 5050.
