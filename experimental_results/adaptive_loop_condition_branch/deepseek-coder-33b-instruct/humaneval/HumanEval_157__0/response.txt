[REASONING]
The function right_angle_triangle takes three numbers a, b, and c as input. It returns True if any of the following conditions are met:
1. a^2 = b^2 + c^2
2. b^2 = a^2 + c^2
3. c^2 = a^2 + b^2

In the given input, a = 7, b = 24, and c = 25.

The first condition is not met because 7^2 is not equal to 24^2 + 25^2.
The second condition is not met because 24^2 is not equal to 7^2 + 25^2.
The third condition is not met because 25^2 is not equal to 7^2 + 24^2.

Therefore, the function right_angle_triangle returns False for the given input.
