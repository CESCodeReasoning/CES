[REASONING]
The function `fib` is called with ( n = 10 ).
`n` is 10, which does not satisfy the condition `n == 0` or `n == 1`.
Therefore, the if branches are not taken and the function recursively calls itself with `n - 1` and `n - 2`.

The recursive calls are:
1. `fib(9)`
2. `fib(8)`

Each of these calls will again call `fib(n - 1)` and `fib(n - 2)` until `n` is either 0 or 1.

The final output of the function `fib(10)` is the sum of the outputs of all these recursive calls.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def fib(n: int):
    if n == 0: ## [CONDITION](n == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return 0
    if n == 1: ## [CONDITION](n == 1)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return 1
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
