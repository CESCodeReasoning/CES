[REASONING]
The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -4, 5, 6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The operation 1 is added to balance, so balance becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The operation 2 is added to balance, so balance becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The operation -4 is added to balance, so balance becomes -1.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is true.
    -Action: `return True` is executed, so the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5, 6])` is True.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0

    for op in operations: ## [STATE]op=[1, 2, -4, 5, 6][/STATE][STATE]operations=[[1, 2, -4, 5, 6]][/STATE]
        balance += op
        if balance < 0: ## [CONDITION](balance < 0)=[False, False, True, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, Y, N, N][/BRANCH]
            return True

    return False
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
True
