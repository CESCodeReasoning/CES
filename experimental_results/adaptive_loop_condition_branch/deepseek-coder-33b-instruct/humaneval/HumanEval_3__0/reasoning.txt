The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -4, 5, 6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The operation 1 is added to balance, so balance becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The operation 2 is added to balance, so balance becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The operation -4 is added to balance, so balance becomes -1.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is true.
    -Action: `return True` is executed, so the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5, 6])` is True.
