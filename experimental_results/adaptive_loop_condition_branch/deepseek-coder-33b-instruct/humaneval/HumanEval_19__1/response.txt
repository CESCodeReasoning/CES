[REASONING]
The function sort_numbers takes a string of numbers as input, where each number is represented as a word (e.g., 'three' instead of '3'). It then maps each word to its corresponding numerical value using the value_map dictionary.

The function then splits the input string into a list of words, filters out any empty strings (which can occur if there are multiple spaces in the input), and sorts this list based on the numerical values of the words.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_numbers on the input 'three five nine', we need to follow the steps above.

1. Split the input string into a list of words: ['three', 'five', 'nine'].
2. Map each word to its corresponding numerical value: [3, 5, 9].
3. Sort this list of numbers: [3, 5, 9].
4. Convert the sorted list of numbers back into a string, with each number separated by a space: '3 5 9'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_numbers on the input 'three five nine' is '3 5 9'.
