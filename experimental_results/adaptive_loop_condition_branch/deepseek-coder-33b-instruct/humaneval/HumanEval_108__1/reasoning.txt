The function `count_nums` is called with ( arr = [1, 6, 9, -6, 0, 1, 5] ).
The function `digits_sum` is defined inside `count_nums`.
The function `digits_sum` takes an integer `n` as input.
For each element `i` in the array `arr`, `digits_sum(i)` is calculated.
If `n` is negative, it is converted to positive and the sign is stored in `neg`.
The digits of `n` are converted to a list of integers.
The first digit is multiplied by `neg`.
The sum of the digits is returned.
The list comprehension `[digits_sum(i) for i in arr]` generates a list of the sums of the digits of the elements in `arr`.
The `filter` function is used to filter out the elements in the list that are not greater than 0.
The `len` function is used to count the number of elements in the filtered list.
The `count_nums` function returns this count.

Therefore, the final output of the function `count_nums([1, 6, 9, -6, 0, 1, 5])` is 6.
