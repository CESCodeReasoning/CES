The function filter_by_substring takes a list of strings and a substring as input. It returns a new list that contains only the strings from the input list that contain the input substring.

In the given input, the list is empty and the substring is 'john'. Since the list is empty, there are no strings to check for the substring 'john'. Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input ([], 'john') is an empty list.
