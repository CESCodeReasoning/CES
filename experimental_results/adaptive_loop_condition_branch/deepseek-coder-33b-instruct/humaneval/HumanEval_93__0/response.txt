[REASONING]
The function encode takes a string message as input. It first defines a string of vowels (both lowercase and uppercase) and creates a dictionary vowels_replace where each vowel is mapped to its ASCII value plus 2.

Next, the function swaps the case of the message (converting all uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa).

Finally, the function iterates over each character in the message. If the character is a vowel, it replaces it with the corresponding value in the vowels_replace dictionary. If the character is not a vowel, it remains the same.

To determine the output of executing the function encode on the input 'YES', we need to follow the steps outlined above.

1. The string 'YES' is converted to 'yes' by swapping the case.
2. The vowels in 'yes' are replaced according to the vowels_replace dictionary. The vowels are 'e' and 'E', and their ASCII values plus 2 are 'g' and 'G' respectively.
3. Therefore, the output of executing the function encode on the input 'YES' is 'gGs'.
