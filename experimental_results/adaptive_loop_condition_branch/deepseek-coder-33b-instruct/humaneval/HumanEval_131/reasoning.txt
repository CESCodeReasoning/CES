The function `digits` is called with ( n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` and `odd_count` are initialized to 1 and 0 respectively.

Iteration 1:
    -The digit '5' is an odd number, so product becomes 5 and odd_count becomes 1.

The condition `odd_count ==0` is false, so the `else` block is executed.
The function returns the value of `product`, which is 5.
