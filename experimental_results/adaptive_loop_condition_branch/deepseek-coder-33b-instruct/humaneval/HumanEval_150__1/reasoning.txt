The function `x_or_y` is called with ( n = 91, x = 56, y = 129 ).

First Condition:
    - `n` is 91, which is not equal to 1.
    - The condition `n == 1` is false.
    - Action: The loop starts.

Iteration 1:
    - `i` is 2, which is not a factor of 91.
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
    - Action: The loop continues.

Iteration 2:
    - `i` is 3, which is not a factor of 91.
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
    - Action: The loop continues.

...

Iteration 39:
    - `i` is 40, which is a factor of 91.
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is true.
    - Action: The function returns `y`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `x_or_y(91, 56, 129)` is 129.
