[REASONING]
The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = '[[[[]]]]' ).
Inside the function, two empty lists `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` are initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '[' is in string, so it is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '[' is in string, so it is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '[' is in string, so it is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ']' is not in string, so it is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ']' is not in string, so it is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ']' is not in string, so it is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character '[' is in string, so it is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 8:
    -The character ']' is not in string, so it is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 9:
    -The character ']' is not in string, so it is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.

After the loop, `closing_bracket_index` is reversed.

Then, a counter `cnt` is initialized to 0 and an index `i` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The condition `i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i]` is true, so `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The condition `i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i]` is true, so `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The condition `i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i]` is true, so `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 1.

Finally, the function returns `cnt >= 2`, which is true.
