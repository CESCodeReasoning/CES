[REASONING]
The function triples_sum_to_zero(l) takes a list of numbers([1, 3, 5, 0]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
In the innermost loop, for each element indexed by j in the inner loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3.
    - For j=1, k in the innermost loop is 2, 3.
    - l[i]=1: compare with 3, 5, 0:
        - When k = 2 (l[k]=3), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 3 (l[k]=0), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - For j=2, k in the innermost loop is 3.
    - l[i]=3: compare with 5, 0:
        - When k = 3 (l[k]=0), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - For j=3, k in the innermost loop is 4.
    - l[i]=5: compare with 0:
        - When k = 4 (l[k]=0), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3.
    - For j=2, k in the innermost loop is 3.
    - l[i]=3: compare with 5, 0:
        - When k = 3 (l[k]=0), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - For j=3, k in the innermost loop is 4.
    - l[i]=5: compare with 0:
        - When k = 4 (l[k]=0), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3.
    - For j=3, k in the innermost loop is 4.
    - l[i]=5: compare with 0:
        - When k = 4 (l[k]=0), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4.
    No more elements to compare.
