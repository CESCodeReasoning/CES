[REASONING]
The function `is_prime` is called with ( n = 5 * 17 = 85 ).

First Condition:
    - The condition `n < 2` is false (since 85 >= 2).
    - The `if` condition is not met, so the `else` block is executed.

Iteration 1:
    - `k` is 2, and `85 % 2` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is incremented to 3.
Iteration 2:
    - `k` is 3, and `85 % 3` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is incremented to 4.
Iteration 3:
    - `k` is 4, and `85 % 4` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is incremented to 5.
Iteration 4:
    - `k` is 5, and `85 % 5` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is incremented to 6.
Iteration 5:
    - `k` is 6, and `85 % 6` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is incremented to 7.
Iteration 6:
    - `k` is 7, and `85 % 7` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is incremented to 8.
Iteration 7:
    - `k` is 8, and `85 % 8` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is incremented to 9.
Iteration 8:
    - `k` is 9, and `85 % 9` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is incremented to 10.
Iteration 9:
    - `k` is 10, and `85 % 10` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is incremented to 11.
Iteration 10:
    - `k` is 11, and `85 % 11` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is incremented to 12.
Iteration 11:
    - `k` is 12, and `85 % 12` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is incremented to 13.
Iteration 12:
    - `k` is 13, and `85 % 13` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is incremented to 14.
Iteration 13:
    - `k` is 14, and `85 % 14` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is incremented to 15.
Iteration 14:
    - `k` is 15, and `85 % 15` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is incremented to 16.
Iteration 15:
    - `k` is 16, and `85 % 16` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is incremented to 17.
Iteration 16:
    - `k` is 17, and `85 % 17` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is incremented to 18.
Iteration 17:
    - `k` is 18, and `85 % 18` is not equal to 0.
    - The `if` condition is not met, so `k` is
