The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [127, 97, 8192] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the list `lst`.
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - `lst[i]` is 127, which is not a prime number.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The `if` condition is not satisfied.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - `lst[i]` is 97, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The `if` condition is satisfied.
    - `maxx` is updated to 97.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - `lst[i]` is 8192, which is not a prime number.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The `if` condition is not satisfied.
After the loop completes, the function returns the sum of the digits of `maxx`, which is 16 (9 + 7).
