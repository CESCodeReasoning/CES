The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers as input. It first filters out the negative numbers (smallest integers) and the positive numbers (largest integers) from the list. Then it returns a tuple containing the maximum of the smallest integers and the minimum of the largest integers.

In the given input, the list is [-1, -3, -5, -6]. The smallest integers are [-1, -3, -5, -6] and the largest integers are [].

Therefore, the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [-1, -3, -5, -6] is (-1, None).
