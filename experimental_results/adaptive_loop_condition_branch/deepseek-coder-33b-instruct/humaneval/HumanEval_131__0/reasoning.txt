The function `digits` is called with ( n = 120 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` and `odd_count` are initialized to 1 and 0 respectively.

Iteration 1:
    -The digit '1' is not odd, so the product and odd_count remain the same.
Iteration 2:
    -The digit '2' is not odd, so the product and odd_count remain the same.
Iteration 3:
    -The digit '0' is not odd, so the product and odd_count remain the same.

The condition `odd_count == 0` is false, so the `else` block is executed.
The function returns the value of `product`, which is 1.
