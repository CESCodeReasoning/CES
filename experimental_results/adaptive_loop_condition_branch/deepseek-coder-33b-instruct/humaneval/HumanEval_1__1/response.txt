[REASONING]
The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with ( paren_string = '()()((((()()((()))))()()()))' ).
Inside the function, two variables `result` and `current_string` are initialized to empty lists.
A variable `current_depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since `current_depth` is 0, `current_string` is appended to `result` and `current_string` is cleared.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since `current_depth` is 0, `current_string` is appended to `result` and `current_string` is cleared.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 2 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 3 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 8:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 4 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 9:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 3 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 10:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 4 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 11:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 3 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 12:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 2 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 13:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 14:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since `current_depth` is 0, `current_string` is appended to `result` and `current_string` is cleared.
Iteration 15:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 16:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since `current_depth` is 0, `current_string` is appended to `result` and `current_string` is cleared.
Iteration 17:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since `current_depth` is 0, `current_string` is appended to `result` and `current_string` is cleared.
Iteration 18:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since `current_depth` is 0, `current_string` is appended to `result` and `current_string` is cleared.

Therefore, the final output of the function `separate_paren_groups('()()((((()()((()))))()()()))')` is ['()', '()', '((((()()((
