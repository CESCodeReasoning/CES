[REASONING]
The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and returns True if n is an even number and greater than or equal to 8. Otherwise, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 13, we need to check if 13 is an even number and greater than or equal to 8.

13 is not an even number, so the function returns False.
