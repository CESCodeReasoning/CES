[REASONING]
The function `pluck` is called with ( arr = [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2] ).
`arr` has 6 elements, so `len(arr)` is 6, which is not equal to 0.
The condition `len(arr) == 0` is false, so the if branch is not taken.
The list `evens` is created by filtering `arr` to only include even numbers.
`evens` is not empty, so the if branch is not taken.
The function returns a list containing the minimum value in `evens` and its index in `arr`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])` is [0, 1].

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def pluck(arr):
    if (len(arr) == 0): ## [CONDITION](len(arr) == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return []
    evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, arr))
    if (evens == []): ## [CONDITION](evens == [])=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return []
    return [min(evens), arr.index(min(evens))]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[0, 1]
