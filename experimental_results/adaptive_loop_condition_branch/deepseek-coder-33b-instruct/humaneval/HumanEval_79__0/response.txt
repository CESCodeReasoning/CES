[REASONING]
The function decimal_to_binary takes a decimal number as input and returns a string that represents the binary representation of the input number.

The function uses the built-in Python function bin() to convert the decimal number to binary. The bin() function returns a string that starts with "0b" to indicate that it's a binary number, so we use [2:] to get the binary number without the "0b".

To determine the output of executing the function decimal_to_binary on the input 32, we need to convert 32 to binary.

The binary representation of 32 is "100000". So, the output of executing the function decimal_to_binary on the input 32 is "db100000db".
