The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "bye" ).
The string "bye" is iterated character by character.
For each character, it checks if it is a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase).
The count of vowels is incremented by 1 for each vowel found.
The condition `s[-1] == 'y' or s[-1] == 'Y'` is checked.
The last character of the string is 'y' or 'Y', so the condition is true.
The action: `n_vowels += 1` updates `n_vowels` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `n_vowels`, which is now 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("bye")` is 2.
