[REASONING]
The function encode takes a string message as input. It first defines a string of vowels both in lowercase and uppercase. Then it creates a dictionary vowels_replace where each vowel is mapped to its corresponding character two positions down in the ASCII table.

Next, the function swaps the case of all the letters in the message.

Finally, it iterates over each character in the message. If the character is a vowel, it replaces it with the corresponding character in the vowels_replace dictionary. If the character is not a vowel, it leaves it as is.

To determine the output of executing the function encode on the input "I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE", we need to follow the steps outlined above.

1. Swap the case of all the letters in the message. The result is "i dOnNT kNoW wHaT To wRiTe".
2. Replace all the vowels with the corresponding character two positions down in the ASCII table. The result is "i dOnNT kNoW wHaT To wRiTe".
3. Join all the characters in the message into a single string. The result is "i dOnNT kNoW wHaT To wRiTe".

Therefore, the output of executing the function encode on the input "I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE" is "i dOnNT kNoW wHaT To wRiTe".
