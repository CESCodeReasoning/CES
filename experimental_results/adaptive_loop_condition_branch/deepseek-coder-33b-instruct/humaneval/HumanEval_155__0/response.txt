[REASONING]
The function `even_odd_count` is called with ( num = -345821 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_count` and `odd_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '3' is not even, so odd_count becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '4' is even, so even_count becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '5' is not even, so odd_count becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '8' is even, so even_count becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '2' is even, so even_count becomes 3.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '1' is not even, so odd_count becomes 3.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def even_odd_count(num):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    for i in str(abs(num)): ## [STATE]i=['3', '4', '5', '8', '2', '1'][/STATE][STATE]str(abs(num))=['345821'][/STATE][STATE]abs(num)=[345821][/STATE]
        if int(i) % 2 == 0: ## [CONDITION](int(i) % 2 == 0)=[False, True, False, True, True, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, Y, N, Y, Y, N][/BRANCH]
            even_count += 1
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y, N, Y, N, Y, N][/BRANCH]
            odd_count += 1
    return (even_count, odd_count)
