[REASONING]
The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with ( n = 123 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The number 1 is not a palindrome, so neither `even_palindrome_count` nor `odd_palindrome_count` is updated.
Iteration 2:
    - The number 2 is a palindrome, but it's an even number, so `even_palindrome_count` is updated to 1.
Iteration 3:
    - The number 3 is a palindrome, but it's an odd number, so `odd_palindrome_count` is updated to 1.
Iteration 4:
    - The number 4 is not a palindrome, so neither `even_palindrome_count` nor `odd_palindrome_count` is updated.
Iteration 5:
    - The number 5 is a palindrome, but it's an odd number, so `odd_palindrome_count` is updated to 2.
Iteration 6:
    - The number 6 is not a palindrome, so neither `even_palindrome_count` nor `odd_palindrome_count` is updated.
Iteration 7:
    - The number 7 is a palindrome, but it's an odd number, so `odd_palindrome_count` is updated to 3.
Iteration 8:
    - The number 8 is not a palindrome, so neither `even_palindrome_count` nor `odd_palindrome_count` is updated.
Iteration 9:
    - The number 9 is a palindrome, but it's an odd number, so `odd_palindrome_count` is updated to 4.
Iteration 10:
    - The number 10 is not a palindrome, so neither `even_palindrome_count` nor `odd_palindrome_count` is updated.
Iteration 11:
    - The number 11 is a palindrome, but it's an odd number, so `odd_palindrome_count` is updated to 5.
Iteration 12:
    - The number 12 is not a palindrome, so neither `even_palindrome_count` nor `odd_palindrome_count` is updated.
Iteration 13:
    - The number 13 is a palindrome, but it's an odd number, so `odd_palindrome_count` is updated to 6.
Iteration 14:
    - The number 14 is not a palindrome, so neither `even_palindrome_count` nor `odd_palindrome_count` is updated.
Iteration 15:
    - The number 15 is not a palindrome, so neither `even_palindrome_count` nor `odd_palindrome_count` is updated.
Iteration 16:
    - The number 16 is not a palindrome, so neither `even_palindrome_count` nor `odd_palindrome_count` is updated.
Iteration 17:
    - The number 17 is a palindrome, but it's an odd number, so `odd_palindrome_count` is updated to 7.
Iteration 18:
    - The number 18 is not a palindrome, so neither `even_palindrome_count` nor `odd_palindrome_count` is updated.
Iteration 19:
    - The number 19 is a palindrome, but it's an odd number, so `odd_palindrome_count` is updated to 8.
Iteration 20:
    - The number 20 is not a palindrome, so neither `even_palindrome_count` nor `odd_palindrome_count` is updated.
Iteration 21:
    - The number 21 is a palindrome, but it's an odd number, so `odd_palindrome_count` is updated to 9.
Iteration 22:
    - The number 22 is not a palindrome, so
