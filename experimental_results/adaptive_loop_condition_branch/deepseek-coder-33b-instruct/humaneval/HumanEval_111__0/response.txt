[REASONING]
The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'a b c d g' ).
Inside the function, a variable `dict1` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
The string `test` is split into a list `list1`.

Iteration 1:
    -The word 'a' is not equal to '', so the count of 'a' in `list1` is checked. Since it's 1, which is not greater than `t` (which is 0), the condition is not met.
Iteration 2:
    -The word 'b' is not equal to '', so the count of 'b' in `list1` is checked. Since it's 1, which is not greater than `t` (which is 0), the condition is not met.
Iteration 3:
    -The word 'c' is not equal to '', so the count of 'c' in `list1` is checked. Since it's 1, which is not greater than `t` (which is 0), the condition is not met.
Iteration 4:
    -The word 'd' is not equal to '', so the count of 'd' in `list1` is checked. Since it's 1, which is not greater than `t` (which is 0), the condition is not met.
Iteration 5:
    -The word 'g' is not equal to '', so the count of 'g' in `list1` is checked. Since it's 1, which is not greater than `t` (which is 0), the condition is not met.

Since `t` is still 0, the condition `t > 0` is not met.

Therefore, the final output of the function `histogram('a b c d g')` is an empty dictionary `{}`.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def histogram(test):
    dict1 = {}
    list1 = test.split(" ")
    t = 0

    for i in list1: ## [STATE]i=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'g'][/STATE][STATE]list1=["a", "b", "c", "d", "g"][/STATE]
        if (list1.count(i) > t) and i != '': ## [CONDITION]((list1.count(i) > t) and i != '')=[False, False, False, False, False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](i != '')=[True, True, True, True, True][/CONDITION][CONDITION](list1.count(i) > t)=[False, False, False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            t = list1.count(i)
    if t > 0: ## [CONDITION](t > 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        for i in list1: ## [STATE]i=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'g'][/STATE][STATE]list1=["a", "b", "c", "d", "g"][/STATE]
            if (list1.count(i) == t): ## [CONDITION](list1.count(i) == t)=[False, False, False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N, N][/BRANCH]

                dict1[i] = t
    return dict1
