The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'a b c d g' ).
Inside the function, a variable `dict1` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
The string `test` is split into a list `list1`.

Iteration 1:
    -The word 'a' is not equal to '', so the count of 'a' in `list1` is checked. Since it's 1, which is not greater than `t` (which is 0), the condition is not met.
Iteration 2:
    -The word 'b' is not equal to '', so the count of 'b' in `list1` is checked. Since it's 1, which is not greater than `t` (which is 0), the condition is not met.
Iteration 3:
    -The word 'c' is not equal to '', so the count of 'c' in `list1` is checked. Since it's 1, which is not greater than `t` (which is 0), the condition is not met.
Iteration 4:
    -The word 'd' is not equal to '', so the count of 'd' in `list1` is checked. Since it's 1, which is not greater than `t` (which is 0), the condition is not met.
Iteration 5:
    -The word 'g' is not equal to '', so the count of 'g' in `list1` is checked. Since it's 1, which is not greater than `t` (which is 0), the condition is not met.

Since `t` is still 0, the condition `t > 0` is not met.

Therefore, the final output of the function `histogram('a b c d g')` is an empty dictionary `{}`.
