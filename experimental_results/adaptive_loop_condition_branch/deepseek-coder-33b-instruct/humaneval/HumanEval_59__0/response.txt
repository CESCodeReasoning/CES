[REASONING]
The function `largest_prime_factor` is called with ( n = 330 ).
Inside the function, a nested function `is_prime` is defined.
The function `is_prime` checks if a number is prime.
The outer loop iterates from 2 through 330 (since ( n = 330 )).
First Iteration (j = 2)
   - `j` is 2, which is a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 2.
Second Iteration (j = 3)
   - `j` is 3, which is a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 3.
Third Iteration (j = 5)
   - `j` is 5, which is a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 5.
Fourth Iteration (j = 11)
   - `j` is 11, which is a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 11.
Fifth Iteration (j = 330)
   - `j` is 330, which is not a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `largest`, which is now 11.

Therefore, the final output of the function `largest_prime_factor(330)` is 11.
