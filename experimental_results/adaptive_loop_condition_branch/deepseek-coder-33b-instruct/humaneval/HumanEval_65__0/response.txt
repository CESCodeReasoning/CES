[REASONING]
The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 97, shift = 8 ).
`shift` is 8, which is greater than the length of the string representation of `x` (which is 2).
The condition `shift > len(s)` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns the reversed string of `x` (`79`).

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(97, 8)` is `79`.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s): ## [CONDITION](shift > len(s))=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return s[::-1]
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return s[len(s) - shift:] + s[:len(s) - shift]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
79
