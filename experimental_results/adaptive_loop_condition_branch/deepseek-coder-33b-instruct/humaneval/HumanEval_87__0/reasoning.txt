The function get_row takes a 2D list lst and an integer x as input. It first creates a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates (i, j) of the elements in lst that are equal to x. It then sorts this list of tuples first by the second element of each tuple (i.e., the column index), in descending order, and then by the first element of each tuple (i.e., the row index), in ascending order.

To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]] and 2, we first create the list of tuples. There are no elements in the 2D list that are equal to 2, so the list of tuples is empty. Then, we sort this list of tuples, which doesn't change the list because it's already sorted. Therefore, the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]] and 2 is [].
