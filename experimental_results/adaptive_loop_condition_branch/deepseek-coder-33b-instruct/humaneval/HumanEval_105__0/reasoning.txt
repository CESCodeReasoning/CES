The function `by_length` is called with (arr = [1, -1, 3, 2] ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `dic` is initialized with number-word pairs.
`sorted_arr` is created by sorting `arr` in descending order.
The loop iterates over each element in `sorted_arr`.

First Iteration(var = 3):
    dic[var] = 'Three'
    'Three' is appended to `new_arr`
Second Iteration(var = 2):
    dic[var] = 'Two'
    'Two' is appended to `new_arr`
Third Iteration(var = 1):
    dic[var] = 'One'
    'One' is appended to `new_arr`
Forth Iteration(var = -1):
    dic[var] throws a KeyError because -1 is not a key in `dic`
    The except block catches the KeyError and does nothing, so `new_arr` remains the same.
