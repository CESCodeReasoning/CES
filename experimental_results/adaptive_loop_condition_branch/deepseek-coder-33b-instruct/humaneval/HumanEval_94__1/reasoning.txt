The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the list `lst`.
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - `lst[i]` is 0, which is not a prime number.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - `lst[i]` is 8, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is true (while `isPrime(lst[i])` is true).
    - Action: `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 8.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - `lst[i]` is 1, which is not a prime number.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - `lst[i]` is 2, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is true (while `isPrime(lst[i])` is true).
    - Action: `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 2.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - `lst[i]` is 1, which is not a prime number.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - `lst[i]` is 7, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is true (while `isPrime(lst[i])` is true).
    - Action: `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 7.
After the loop completes, the function returns the sum of the digits of the maximum prime number in the list, which is 7.
