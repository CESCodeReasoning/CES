The function `rounded_avg` is called with ( n = 350, m = 902 ).
The condition ( m < n ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken.
A variable `summation` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 350 through 902 (since ( n = 350, m = 902 )).
For each iteration, `summation += i` updates `summation` by adding the current value of `i`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the binary representation of the rounded average of the numbers from 350 to 902.
