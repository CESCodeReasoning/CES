The function `is_sorted` is called with ( lst = [5] ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `count_digit` is initialized with keys as elements of `lst` and values as 0.
The loop iterates through the elements of `lst`.
For the first iteration (i = 5):
    `count_digit[i]+=1` updates `count_digit` to {5: 1}.
The condition `any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst)` is not satisfied as there is no element in `lst` that has a count greater than 2.
The condition `all(lst[i-1] <= lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst)))` is satisfied as there is only one element in `lst`.
Therefore, the function returns `True` as the output.
