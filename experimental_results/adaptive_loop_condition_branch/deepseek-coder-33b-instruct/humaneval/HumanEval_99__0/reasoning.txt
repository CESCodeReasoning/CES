The function `closest_integer` is called with ( value = "14.5" ).
Inside the function, the condition (value.count('.') == 1) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken.
The while loop removes the trailing zeros from the value, but since there are no trailing zeros, the loop is not executed.
The condition (value[-2:] == '.5') is also satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken.
The condition (num > 0) is also satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken.
The function returns `res` as the output.
