The function `prod_signs` is called with ( arr = [-1, 1, 1, 1] ).
`arr` is not empty, so the condition `not arr` is false.
The condition `0 in arr` is false, so `prod` is calculated as `(-1) ** len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr)))`.
Here, `filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr)` returns a list of negative numbers in `arr`, and `len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr)))` gives the count of negative numbers.
Since there is 1 negative number in `arr`, `(-1) ** len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr)))` is -1.
`prod` is then multiplied by the sum of absolute values of all elements in `arr`, which is 4.
The final result is `prod * sum([abs(i) for i in arr])`, which is `-4`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `prod_signs([-1, 1, 1, 1])` is `-4`.
