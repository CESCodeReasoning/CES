The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input. It splits the string s into a list of words using the split() function. For each word in the list, it converts the word into a list of characters, sorts the list, and then joins the characters back into a string. Finally, it joins all the words back into a string with spaces in between.

To determine the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input "Hi", we need to follow the steps above.

1. Split the string "Hi" into a list of words: ["Hi"]
2. For each word in the list, convert the word into a list of characters, sort the list, and then join the characters back into a string: ["Hi"] -> ["H", "i"] -> ["H", "i"] -> "Hi"
3. Join all the words back into a string with spaces in between: ["Hi"] -> "Hi"

Therefore, the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input "Hi" is "Hi".
