The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [15, 33, 1422, 1] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `odd_digit_elements` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 15 has all odd digits, so it is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 33 has all odd digits, so it is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 1422 does not have all odd digits, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 1 has all odd digits, so it is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.

Finally, the function returns the sorted list of numbers with all odd digits.
