The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [1, -1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is added to `s`, which becomes -1.
    -Since `s` is less than 0, `s` is reset to 0.
    -`max_sum` is updated to 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The number -1 is added to `s`, which becomes -2.
    -Since `s` is less than 0, `s` is reset to 0.
    -`max_sum` is updated to 0.

Since `max_sum` is still 0, the condition `max_sum == 0` is true.
    -The `max_sum` is updated to the maximum negative number in `nums`, which is -1.

The `min_sum` is then calculated as -`max_sum`, which is 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([1, -1])` is 1.
