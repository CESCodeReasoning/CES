The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "2 apples and 3 oranges", n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a list `lis` is initialized.
The loop iterates over the words in the string `s` after splitting it by spaces.
First Iteration (i = "2")
   - `i` is "2", which is a digit.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is true.
   - Action: `lis.append(int(i))` results in `lis = [2]`.
Second Iteration (i = "apples")
   - `i` is "apples", which is not a digit.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Third Iteration (i = "and")
   - `i` is "and", which is not a digit.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Fourth Iteration (i = "3")
   - `i` is "3", which is a digit.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is true.
   - Action: `lis.append(int(i))` updates `lis` to `[2, 3]`.
Fifth Iteration (i = "oranges")
   - `i` is "oranges", which is not a digit.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `n - sum(lis)`, which is `5 - (2 + 3) = 0`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges",5)` is 0.
