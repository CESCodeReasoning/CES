The function `exchange` is called with ( lst1 = [100, 200] and lst2 = [200, 200] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 100 is not odd, so odd remains 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 200 is not odd, so odd remains 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 200 is even, so even becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 200 is even, so even becomes 2.

The condition `even >= odd` is false (2 >= 0), so the function returns "NO".
