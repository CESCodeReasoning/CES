The function `monotonic` is called with ( l = [4, 1, 0, -10] ).
`l` is not sorted in either ascending or descending order.
The condition `l == sorted(l) or l == sorted(l, reverse=True)` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken and the method returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])` is False.
