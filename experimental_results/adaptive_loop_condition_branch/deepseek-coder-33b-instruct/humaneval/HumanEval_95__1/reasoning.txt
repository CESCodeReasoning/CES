The function `check_dict_case` is called with ( dict = {"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"} ).

First, the function checks if the dictionary is empty. In this case, it is not, so the condition `len(dict.keys()) == 0` is false.

The function then enters a loop that iterates over the keys of the dictionary.

Iteration 1:
    - The key 'Name' is a string, so the condition `isinstance(key, str) == False` is false.
    - The state is "start", so the condition `state == "start"` is true.
    - The key 'Name' is not uppercase, so the condition `key.isupper()` is false.
    - The key 'Name' is lowercase, so the condition `key.islower()` is true.
    - The state is updated to "lower".
Iteration 2:
    - The key 'Age' is a string, so the condition `isinstance(key, str) == False` is false.
    - The state is "lower", so the condition `state == "start"` is false.
    - The key 'Age' is not uppercase, so the condition `key.isupper()` is false.
    - The key 'Age' is lowercase, so the condition `key.islower()` is true.
    - The state remains "lower".
Iteration 3:
    - The key 'City' is a string, so the condition `isinstance(key, str) == False` is false.
    - The state is "lower", so the condition `state == "start"` is false.
    - The key 'City' is not uppercase, so the condition `key.isupper()` is false.
    - The key 'City' is lowercase, so the condition `key.islower()` is true.
    - The state remains "lower".

After the loop, the function returns `True`, because the state is "lower" or "upper".
