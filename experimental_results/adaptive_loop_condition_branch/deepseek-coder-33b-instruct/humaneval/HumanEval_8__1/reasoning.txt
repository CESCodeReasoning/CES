The function `sum_product` is called with (numbers = [100, 0] ).
Inside the function, two variables `sum_value` and `prod_value` are initialized to 0 and 1 respectively.
The loop iterates over the list `numbers`.

First Iteration(n = 100):
    sum_value += n results in sum_value = 100
    prod_value *= n results in prod_value = 100
Second Iteration(n = 0):
    sum_value += n results in sum_value = 100
    prod_value *= n results in prod_value = 0

After the loop completes, the function returns a tuple containing the values of `sum_value` and `prod_value`, which are now 100 and 0 respectively.
