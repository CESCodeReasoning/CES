The function `solve` is called with ( s = "AsDf" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` and `idx` are initialized to 0.
A new list `new_str` is created from the string `s`.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'A' is an alphabet, so it is swapped to 'a' and `flg` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 's' is not an alphabet.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'D' is an alphabet, so it is swapped to 'd' and `flg` remains 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'f' is an alphabet, so it is swapped to 'F' and `flg` remains 1.

After the loop, the list `new_str` is converted back to a string `s`.

Since `flg` is not 0, the string `s` is returned as it is.
