[REASONING]
The function `solve` is called with ( s = "AsDf" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` and `idx` are initialized to 0.
A new list `new_str` is created from the string `s`.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'A' is an alphabet, so it is swapped to 'a' and `flg` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 's' is not an alphabet.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'D' is an alphabet, so it is swapped to 'd' and `flg` remains 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'f' is an alphabet, so it is swapped to 'F' and `flg` remains 1.

After the loop, the list `new_str` is converted back to a string `s`.

Since `flg` is not 0, the string `s` is returned as it is.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def solve(s):
    flg = 0
    idx = 0
    new_str = list(s)
    for i in s: ## [STATE]i=['A', 's', 'D', 'f'][/STATE][STATE]s=["AsDf"][/STATE]
        if i.isalpha(): ## [CONDITION](i.isalpha())=[True, False, True, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, N, Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            new_str[idx] = i.swapcase()
            flg = 1
        idx += 1
    s = ""
    for i in new_str: ## [STATE]i=['a', 's', 'd', 'F'][/STATE][STATE]new_str=["AsDf"][/STATE]
        s += i
    if flg == 0: ## [CONDITION](flg == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return s[len(s)::-1]
    return s
