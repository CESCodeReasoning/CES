The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if the current number is even.
If it is, it calculates the factorial of the number and appends it to the list ret.
If it is not, it calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to the current number and appends it to the list ret.
First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, which is odd.
    - `x` is initialized to 0.
    - The inner loop iterates from 1 to `i` (inclusive).
    - `x` is incremented by `j` in each iteration.
    - `x` is 1, so append 1 to `ret`.
Second Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, which is even.
    - `x` is initialized to 1.
    - The inner loop iterates from 1 to `i` (inclusive).
    - `x` is multiplied by `j` in each iteration.
    - `x` is 2, so append 2 to `ret`.
Third Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, which is odd.
    - `x` is initialized to 0.
    - The inner loop iterates from 1 to `i` (inclusive).
    - `x` is incremented by `j` in each iteration.
    - `x` is 6, so append 6 to `ret`.
