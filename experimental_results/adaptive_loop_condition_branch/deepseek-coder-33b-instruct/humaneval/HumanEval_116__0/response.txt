[REASONING]
The function sort_array takes a list of integers as input. It first sorts the list in ascending order, then sorts the sorted list again based on the number of 1's in their binary representation.

Here's the step by step reasoning:

1. The function sort_array is defined to take a list arr as input.
2. Inside the function, the sorted function is called on arr. This will return a new list that is a sorted version of arr.
3. The sorted function is called again on the result of the first sorted function call. This is because the sorted function returns a new list and does not modify the original list.
4. The key argument of the second sorted function call is a lambda function that takes an integer x and returns the number of 1's in the binary representation of x.
5. The bin function is used to convert x to a binary string. The [2:] slice is used to remove the '0b' prefix from the binary string.
6. The count method is then used to count the number of '1's in the binary string.
7. The sorted function will use this count as the key to sort the list.
8. The sorted function will return a new list that is a sorted version of the original list, sorted first by the original value of the elements and then by the number of 1's in their binary representation.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [3,6,44,12,32,5], we need to follow the steps above.
