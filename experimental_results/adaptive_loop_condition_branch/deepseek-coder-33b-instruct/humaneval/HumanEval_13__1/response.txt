[REASONING]
The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 144, b = 60 ).
Inside the function, a while loop is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
First Iteration:
    - b = 60, a % b = 144 % 60 = 12.
    - `a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 60 and `b` to 12.
Second Iteration:
    - b = 12, a % b = 60 % 12 = 0.
    - `a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 12 and `b` to 0.
Since `b` is now 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 12.

from typing import *


def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    while b: ## [STATE]b=[60, 12, 0][/STATE]
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
