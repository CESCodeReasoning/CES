The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = ")((" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character ')' is not an opening bracket, so depth decreases to -1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is an opening bracket, so depth increases to 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is an opening bracket, so depth increases to 1.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `depth == 0`, which is False.
