[REASONING]
The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = ")((" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character ')' is not an opening bracket, so depth decreases to -1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is an opening bracket, so depth increases to 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is an opening bracket, so depth increases to 1.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `depth == 0`, which is False.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets: ## [STATE]b=[')', '(', '('][/STATE][STATE]brackets=[")(("][/STATE]
        if b == "(": ## [CONDITION](b == "(")=[False, True, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            depth += 1
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y, N, N][/BRANCH]
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0: ## [CONDITION](depth < 0)=[False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            return False
    return depth == 0
