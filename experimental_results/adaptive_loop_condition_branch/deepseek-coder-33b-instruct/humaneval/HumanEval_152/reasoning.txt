The function compare takes two lists, game and guess, as input. It returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists.

To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input [[1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]], we need to calculate the absolute difference between corresponding elements of the two lists.

The first element of the first list is 1 and the first element of the second list is 1, so the absolute difference is 0.
The second element of the first list is 2 and the second element of the second list is 2, so the absolute difference is 0.
The third element of the first list is 3 and the third element of the second list is 3, so the absolute difference is 0.
The fourth element of the first list is 4 and the fourth element of the second list is 4, so the absolute difference is 0.
The fifth element of the first list is 5 and the fifth element of the second list is 2, so the absolute difference is 3.
The sixth element of the first list is 1 and the sixth element of the second list is -2, so the absolute difference is 3.

Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input [[1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]] is [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3].
