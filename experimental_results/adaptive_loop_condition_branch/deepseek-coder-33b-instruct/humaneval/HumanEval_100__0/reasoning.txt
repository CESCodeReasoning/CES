The function make_a_pile takes an integer n as input and returns a list of integers. The list is created using a list comprehension, which generates a sequence of numbers.

The sequence is generated by iterating over the range of numbers from 0 to n-1 (inclusive). For each number i in this range, the expression n + 2 * i is evaluated and the result is added to the list.

In the case of make_a_pile(4), the range of numbers is [0, 1, 2, 3]. For each number i in this range, the expression n + 2 * i is evaluated as follows:
- For i = 0, the expression is 4 + 2 * 0 = 4.
- For i = 1, the expression is 4 + 2 * 1 = 6.
- For i = 2, the expression is 4 + 2 * 2 = 8.
- For i = 3, the expression is 4 + 2 * 3 = 10.

So, the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 4 is the list [4, 6, 8, 10].
