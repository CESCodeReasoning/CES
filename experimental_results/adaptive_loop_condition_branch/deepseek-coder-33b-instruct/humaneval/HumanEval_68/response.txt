[REASONING]
The function `pluck` is called with ( arr = [4,2,3] ).
The length of `arr` is 3, which does not equal 0, so the first condition `len(arr) == 0` is false.
The `else` branch is taken, and the function continues.
The `filter` function is used to create a new list `evens` that contains only the even numbers from `arr`.
The list `evens` is not empty, so the second condition `evens == []` is false.
The `else` branch is taken, and the function continues.
The `min` function is used to find the smallest number in `evens`, and its index in `arr` is returned.

Therefore, the final output of the function `pluck([4,2,3])` is [2, 1].

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def pluck(arr):
    if(len(arr) == 0): return [] ## [CONDITION](len(arr) == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
    evens = list(filter(lambda x: x%2 == 0, arr))
    if(evens == []): return [] ## [CONDITION](evens == [])=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
    return [min(evens), arr.index(min(evens))]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[2, 1]
