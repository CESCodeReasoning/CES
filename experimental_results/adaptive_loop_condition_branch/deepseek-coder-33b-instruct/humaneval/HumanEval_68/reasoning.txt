The function `pluck` is called with ( arr = [4,2,3] ).
The length of `arr` is 3, which does not equal 0, so the first condition `len(arr) == 0` is false.
The `else` branch is taken, and the function continues.
The `filter` function is used to create a new list `evens` that contains only the even numbers from `arr`.
The list `evens` is not empty, so the second condition `evens == []` is false.
The `else` branch is taken, and the function continues.
The `min` function is used to find the smallest number in `evens`, and its index in `arr` is returned.

Therefore, the final output of the function `pluck([4,2,3])` is [2, 1].
