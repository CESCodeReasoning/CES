[REASONING]
The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and returns True if n is an even number and greater than or equal to 8. Otherwise, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 6, we need to check if 6 is an even number and greater than or equal to 8.

6 is an even number because it can be divided by 2 with no remainder. However, it is not greater than or equal to 8. Therefore, the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 6 is False.
