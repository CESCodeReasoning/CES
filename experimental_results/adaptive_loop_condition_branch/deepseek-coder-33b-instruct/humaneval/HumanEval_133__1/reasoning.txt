The function `sum_squares` is called with (lst = [-2.4,1,1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `squared` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through each element in the list.

First Iteration(i = -2.4):
    math.ceil(i)**2 = 4
    squared = 0 + 4 results in squared = 4
Second Iteration(i = 1):
    math.ceil(i)**2 = 1
    squared = 4 + 1 results in squared = 5
Third Iteration(i = 1):
    math.ceil(i)**2 = 1
    squared = 5 + 1 results in squared = 6
