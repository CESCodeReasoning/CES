The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list A to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - A[i]=1: compare with 2, 5, 10, 17, 26:
        - When j = 1 (A[j]=2), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (A[j]=5), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (A[j]=10), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (A[j]=17), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (A[j]=26), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - A[i]=2: compare with 5, 10, 17, 26:
        - When j = 2 (A[j]=5), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (A[j]=10), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (A[j]=17), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (A[j]=26), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
    - A[i]=5: compare with 10, 17, 26:
        - When j = 3 (A[j]=10), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (A[j]=17), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (A[j]=26), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
    - A[i]=10: compare with 17, 26:
        - When j = 4 (A[j]=17), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (A[j]=26), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
