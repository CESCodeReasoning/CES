The function `bf` is called with ( planet1 = "Earth", planet2 = "Earth" ).
`planet1` and `planet2` are both "Earth", which are in the list `planet_names`.
The condition `planet1 not in planet_names or planet2 not in planet_names or planet1 == planet2` is false.
The if branch is not taken and the function continues to the next lines.
`planet1_index` is 2 (since "Earth" is at index 2 in `planet_names`).
`planet2_index` is also 2 (since "Earth" is at index 2 in `planet_names`).
Since `planet1_index` is not less than `planet2_index`, the else branch is taken.
The function returns an empty tuple `()`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `bf("Earth", "Earth")` is an empty tuple `()`.
