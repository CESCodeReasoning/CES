The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "<<><>>" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '<' is equal to "<", so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '<' is equal to "<", so depth becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes 0.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '<' is equal to "<", so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes 0.
Iteration 7:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes -1.

The depth is less than 0, so the function returns False.
