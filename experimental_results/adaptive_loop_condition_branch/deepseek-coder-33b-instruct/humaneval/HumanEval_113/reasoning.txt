The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['1234567']).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates over each string in the list.

First Iteration (arr = '1234567'):
    `n = sum(int(d)%2==1 for d in arr)` counts the number of odd digits in '1234567'.
    '1234567' has 4 odd digits, so `n` = 4.
    The string 'the number of odd elements 4 in the string 4 of the 4nput.' is appended to `res`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the list `res`, which contains the string 'the number of odd elements 4 in the string 4 of the 4nput.'.
