[REASONING]
The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['1234567']).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates over each string in the list.

First Iteration (arr = '1234567'):
    `n = sum(int(d)%2==1 for d in arr)` counts the number of odd digits in '1234567'.
    '1234567' has 4 odd digits, so `n` = 4.
    The string 'the number of odd elements 4 in the string 4 of the 4nput.' is appended to `res`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the list `res`, which contains the string 'the number of odd elements 4 in the string 4 of the 4nput.'.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def odd_count(lst):
    res = []
    for arr in lst: ## [STATE]lst=['1234567'][/STATE]
        n = sum(int(d)%2==1 for d in arr)
        res.append("the number of odd elements " + str(n) + " in the string "+ str(n) +" of the "+ str(n) +"nput.")
    return res
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
['the number of odd elements 4 in the string 4 of the 4nput.']
