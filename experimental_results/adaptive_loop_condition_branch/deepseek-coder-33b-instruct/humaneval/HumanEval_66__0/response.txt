[REASONING]
The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "abcCd" ).
`s` is "abcCd", which does not equal to "".
The condition `s == ""` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
The function returns the sum of the ASCII values of the uppercase characters in the string.
In this case, the only uppercase character is 'C', whose ASCII value is 67.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digitSum("abcCd")` is 67.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def digitSum(s):
    if s == "": ## [CONDITION](s == "")=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return 0
    return sum(ord(char) if char.isupper() else 0 for char in s)
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
67
