[REASONING]
The function `encrypt` is called with ( s = 'hi' ).
Inside the function, a variable `out` is initialized to an empty string.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'h' is in d, so out becomes 'j'.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'i' is in d, so out becomes 'j' + 'k'.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def encrypt(s):
    d = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    out = ''
    for c in s: ## [STATE]c=['h', 'i'][/STATE][STATE]s=['hi'][/STATE]
        if c in d: ## [CONDITION](c in d)=[True, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            out += d[(d.index(c)+2*2) % 26]
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N, N][/BRANCH]
            out += c
    return out
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
'jk'
