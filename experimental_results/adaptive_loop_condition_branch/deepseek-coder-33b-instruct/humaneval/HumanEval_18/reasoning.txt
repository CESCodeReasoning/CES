The function `how_many_times` is called with ( string = "" , substring = "x" ).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0.

The loop iterates from 0 through 0 (since ( len(string) - len(substring) + 1 ) is 0).

Since the range is empty, the loop doesn't execute.

Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `times`, which is 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `how_many_times('', 'x')` is 0.
