[REASONING]
The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input. It uses the Counter class from the collections module to count the frequency of each number in the list. Then it returns a new list that contains only the numbers that appear once or not at all in the input list.

In the input [1, 2, 3, 4], all numbers appear once, so the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] is the same list [1, 2, 3, 4].

[OUTPUT]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
