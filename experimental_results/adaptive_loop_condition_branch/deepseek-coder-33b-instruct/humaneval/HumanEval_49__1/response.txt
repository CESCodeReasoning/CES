[REASONING]
The function `modp` is called with (n = 0, p = 101).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 0 to n-1 (since range(n) = []).
Since the loop doesn't run at all, `ret` remains 1.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ret`, which is 1.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def modp(n: int, p: int):
    ret = 1
    for i in range(n): ## [STATE]range(n)=[][/STATE][STATE]n=0[/STATE]
        ret = (2 * ret) % p
    return ret
