The function `any_int` is called with ( x = 2, y = 3, z = 1 ).
All the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers, which satisfies (isinstance(x,int) and isinstance(y,int) and isinstance(z,int)).
The if branch is taken.
`x` + `y` is not equal to `z`, `x` + `z` is not equal to `y`, and `y` + `z` is not equal to `x`.
The else branch is taken.

Therefore, the final output of the function `any_int(2, 3, 1)` is False.
