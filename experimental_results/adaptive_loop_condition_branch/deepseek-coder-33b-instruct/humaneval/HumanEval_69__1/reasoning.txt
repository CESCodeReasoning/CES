The function `search` is called with ( lst = [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] ).
Inside the function, a list `frq` is initialized with zeros.
The first loop iterates over the elements of `lst`.
   - For each element `i` in `lst`, the frequency count `frq[i]` is incremented by 1.
   - After the first loop, `frq` becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8] (since there are 8 occurrences of 8 in `lst`).
The second loop iterates from 1 through 9 (since `max(lst)` is 8).
   - For each `i` in the range, the condition `frq[i] >= i` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `ans` is updated to `i`.
   - In this case, `frq[8]` is 8, which is greater than or equal to 8.
   - Therefore, `ans` is updated to 8.
Return Statement
   - After the loops complete, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is now 8.

Therefore, the final output of the function `search([8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8])` is 8.
