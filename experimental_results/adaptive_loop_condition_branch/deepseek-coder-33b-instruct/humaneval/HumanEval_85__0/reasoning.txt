The function add takes a list of integers as input. It then creates a new list that includes every second element of the input list starting from the second element (index 1), but only if the element is even. It then returns the sum of this new list.

To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 0, 6, 7], we need to consider the second and fourth elements of the list (index 1 and 3). The second element is 0, which is not even, so we ignore it. The fourth element is 7, which is not even, so we ignore it.

Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 0, 6, 7] is 0, because there are no elements in the list that are both even and are at an odd index.
