The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [-5, 2, 48, 9, 4, 0, 6, 7] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list.

Iteration 1:
    -The element -5 is not greater than m (-5), so m remains -5.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 2 is greater than m (-5), so m becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The element 48 is greater than m (2), so m becomes 48.
Iteration 4:
    -The element 9 is not greater than m (48), so m remains 48.
Iteration 5:
    -The element 4 is not greater than m (48), so m remains 48.
Iteration 6:
    -The element 0 is not greater than m (48), so m remains 48.
Iteration 7:
    -The element 6 is not greater than m (48), so m remains 48.
Iteration 8:
    -The element 7 is not greater than m (48), so m remains 48.

The function returns the value of `m`, which is 48.
