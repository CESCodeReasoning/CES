The function `factorize` is called with ( n = 2 ).
Inside the function, a variable `fact` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 2 through 2 (since ( n = 2 )).
First Iteration (i = 2):
    - i <= 2 when i=2
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `fact.append(i)` appends 2 to `fact`.
    - `n //= i` updates `n` to 1.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
    - i <= 2 when i=3.
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `i += 1` updates `i` to 4.
Since the loop condition `i <= int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is not satisfied, the loop ends.
After the loop completes, the function checks if `n > 1`. The condition `n > 1` is false. The else branch is not taken.
Finally, the function returns the value of `fact`, which is now [2].
