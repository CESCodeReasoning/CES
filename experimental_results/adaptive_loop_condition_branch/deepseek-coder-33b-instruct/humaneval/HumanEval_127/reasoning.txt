The function `intersection` is called with ( interval1 = (1, 2) and interval2 = (2, 3) ).

The function `is_prime` checks if a number is prime.

The function `intersection` calculates the intersection of two intervals.

The intersection of two intervals is defined as the interval that contains all points that are in both intervals.

In this case, the intersection of (1, 2) and (2, 3) is (2, 2), which has a length of 0.

The function `is_prime` checks if the length of the intersection is a prime number.

The function `is_prime` returns False for 0 and 1, and True for 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `intersection((1, 2), (2, 3))` is "NO".
