The function `longest` is called with ( strings = ['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc'] ).

First Iteration:
    - The condition `not strings` is false, so the `if` block is not executed.

Second Iteration:
    - The variable `maxlen` is set to the maximum length of the strings in the list, which is 4.

Third Iteration:
    - The variable `s` is set to the first string in the list, which is 'x'.
    - The condition `len(s) == maxlen` is false, so the `if` block is not executed.

Fourth Iteration:
    - The variable `s` is set to the second string in the list, which is 'yyy'.
    - The condition `len(s) == maxlen` is false, so the `if` block is not executed.

Fifth Iteration:
    - The variable `s` is set to the third string in the list, which is 'zzzz'.
    - The condition `len(s) == maxlen` is true, so the `if` block is executed and the function returns 'zzzz'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `longest(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc'])` is 'zzzz'.
