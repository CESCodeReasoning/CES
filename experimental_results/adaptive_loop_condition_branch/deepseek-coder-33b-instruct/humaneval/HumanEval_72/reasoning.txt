The function `will_it_fly` is called with ( q = [3, 2, 3], w = 9 ).
The condition `sum(q) > w` is false. The first branch is not taken.
The loop iterates from 0 through 1 (since len(q)-1 = 2).
First Iteration (i = 0, j = 2):
    - i<j when i=0, j=2
    - The condition `q[i] != q[j]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - `i+=1` updates `i` to 1.
    - `j-=1` updates `j` to 1.
Second Iteration (i = 1, j = 1):
    - i<j when i=1, j=1
    - The condition `q[i] != q[j]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - `i+=1` updates `i` to 2.
    - `j-=1` updates `j` to 0.
The loop ends because `i` is no longer less than `j`.
The function returns the value of `True`.
