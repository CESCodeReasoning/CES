The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = '0' ).
The length of the string is calculated as `l`.
The length of '0' is 1.
The condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is false (since 1 is not equal to 0 or 1).
The loop is not executed because the condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is false.
Therefore, the function returns False.
