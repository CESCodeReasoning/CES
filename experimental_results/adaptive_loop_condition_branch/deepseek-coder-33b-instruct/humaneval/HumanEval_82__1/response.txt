[REASONING]
The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = '0' ).
The length of the string is calculated as `l`.
The length of '0' is 1.
The condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is false (since 1 is not equal to 0 or 1).
The loop is not executed because the condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is false.
Therefore, the function returns False.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def prime_length(string):
    l = len(string)
    if l == 0 or l == 1: ## [CONDITION](l == 0 or l == 1)=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](l == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](l == 1)=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return False
    for i in range(2, l): ## [STATE]range(2, l)=[][/STATE][STATE]l=[1][/STATE]
        if l % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
