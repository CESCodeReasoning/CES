The function `fib` is called with ( n = 11 ).
`n` is 11, which does not satisfy the condition `n == 0` or `n == 1`.
Therefore, the if branches are not taken and the function recursively calls itself with `n - 1` and `n - 2`.

The recursive calls are:
1. `fib(10)`
2. `fib(9)`
3. `fib(8)`
4. `fib(7)`
5. `fib(6)`
6. `fib(5)`
7. `fib(4)`
8. `fib(3)`
9. `fib(2)`
10. `fib(1)`
11. `fib(0)`

Each of these calls will continue to make recursive calls until they reach the base cases `n == 0` or `n == 1`.

The final output of the function `fib(11)` is the sum of the outputs of all these recursive calls.
