The function `starts_one_ends` is called with ( n = 4 ).
`n` is 4, which does not equal 1.
The condition `n == 1` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
The method returns `18 * (10 ** (n - 2))`, which is `18 * (10 ** (4 - 2))`, which equals `18 * (10 ** 2)`, which equals `1800`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `starts_one_ends(4)` is 1800.
