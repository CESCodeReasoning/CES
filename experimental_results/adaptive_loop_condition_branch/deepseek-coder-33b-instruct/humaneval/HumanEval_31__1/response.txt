[REASONING]
The function `is_prime` is called with ( n = 11 * 7 = 77 ).

First Condition:
    - `n` is 77, which is not less than 2.
    - The condition `n < 2` is false.

Iteration 1:
    - `k` is 2, and `n % k` is 0, so the condition `n % k == 0` is true.
    - Action: The function returns False.
