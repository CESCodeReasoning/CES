The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "5 apples and 6 oranges", n = 21 ).
Inside the function, a list `lis` is initialized.
The loop iterates over the words in the string `s`, which are split by spaces.
First Iteration (i = "5")
   - `i` is "5", which is a digit.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is true.
   - Action: `lis.append(int(i))` results in `lis = [5]`.
Second Iteration (i = "apples")
   - `i` is "apples", which is not a digit.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Third Iteration (i = "and")
   - `i` is "and", which is not a digit.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Fourth Iteration (i = "6")
   - `i` is "6", which is a digit.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is true.
   - Action: `lis.append(int(i))` results in `lis = [5, 6]`.
Fifth Iteration (i = "oranges")
   - `i` is "oranges", which is not a digit.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `n - sum(lis)`, which is `21 - (5 + 6) = 2`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges",21)` is 2.
