[REASONING]
The function sort_third takes a list l as input. It first converts the input list into a new list. Then it sorts every third element in the new list. The function returns the new list.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to follow the steps:
1. Convert the input list [1, 2, 3] into a new list [1, 2, 3].
2. Sort every third element in the new list [1, 2, 3]. Since there is no third element, the list remains the same.
3. Return the new list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3].
