[REASONING]
The function add_elements takes an array arr and an integer k as input. It returns the sum of the first k elements of arr that have a length of 2 or less when converted to a string.

To determine the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9] and 4, we need to sum the first 4 elements of the array that have a length of 2 or less when converted to a string.

The first 4 elements of the array are 11, 21, 3, and 90.

11 and 21 have a length of 2 when converted to a string.
3 has a length of 1 when converted to a string.
90 has a length of 2 when converted to a string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9] and 4 is 11 + 21 + 90 = 122.
