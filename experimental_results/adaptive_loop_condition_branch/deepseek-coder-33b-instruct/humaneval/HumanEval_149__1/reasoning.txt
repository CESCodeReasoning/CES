The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order.

Iteration 1:
    -The string 'school' has an odd number of characters, so it is not appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 2:
    -The string 'AI' has an even number of characters, so it is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The string 'asdf' has an odd number of characters, so it is not appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 4:
    -The string 'b' has an odd number of characters, so it is not appended to `new_lst`.

After the loop, `new_lst` is sorted by length and returned.
