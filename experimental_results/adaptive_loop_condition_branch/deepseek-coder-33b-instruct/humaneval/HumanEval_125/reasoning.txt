The function `split_words` is called with ( txt = "Hello world!" ).
The condition `" " in txt` is False, so the first branch is not taken.
The condition `"," in txt` is also False, so the second branch is not taken.
The `else` branch is taken.
In the `else` branch, the function returns the length of a list comprehension. The list comprehension iterates over each character in `txt`, and includes the character in the list if it is a lowercase letter and its ASCII value is even.
In "Hello world!", the lowercase letters are 'e', 'o', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', and '!', but only 'o', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', and '!' have even ASCII values.

Therefore, the final output of the function `split_words("Hello world!")` is 6.
