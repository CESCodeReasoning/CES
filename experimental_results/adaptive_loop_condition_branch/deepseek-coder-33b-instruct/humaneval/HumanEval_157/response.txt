[REASONING]
The function right_angle_triangle takes three numbers a, b, and c as input. It checks if any of the following conditions is true:
1. a*a is equal to b*b + c*c
2. b*b is equal to a*a + c*c
3. c*c is equal to a*a + b*b

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

In the given input, a=3, b=4, and c=5. The first condition is true because 3*3 is equal to 4*4 + 5*5.
Therefore, the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input (3, 4, 5) is True.
