[REASONING]
The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the list `lst`.
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - `lst[i]` is 0, which is not a prime number.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - `lst[i]` is 3, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - Action: `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 3.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - `lst[i]` is 2, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - Action: `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 2.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - `lst[i]` is 1, which is not a prime number.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - `lst[i]` is 3, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - Action: `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 3.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - `lst[i]` is 5, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - Action: `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 5.
Seventh Iteration (i = 6):
    - `lst[i]` is 7, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - Action: `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 7.
Eighth Iteration (i = 7):
    - `lst[i]` is 4, which is not a prime number.
Ninth Iteration (i = 8):
    - `lst[i]` is 5, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - Action: `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 5.
Tenth Iteration (i = 9):
    - `lst[i]` is 5, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - Action: `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 5.
Eleventh Iteration (i = 10):
    - `lst[i]` is 5, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - Action: `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 5.
Twelfth Iteration (i = 11):
    - `lst[i]` is 5, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - Action: `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 5.
Thirteenth Iteration (i = 12):
    - `lst[i]` is 2, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - Action: `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx
