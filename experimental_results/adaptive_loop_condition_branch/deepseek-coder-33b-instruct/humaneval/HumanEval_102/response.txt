[REASONING]
The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 12, y = 15 ).
`x` is 12 and `y` is 15.
The condition `x > y` is false (12 is not greater than 15).
The first if branch is not taken.
The condition `y % 2 == 0` is false (15 is not even).
The second if branch is not taken.
The condition `x == y` is false (12 is not equal to 15).
The third if branch is not taken.
The function returns `y - 1`, which is 14.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(12, 15)` is 14.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def choose_num(x, y):
    if x > y: ## [CONDITION](x > y)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return -1
    if y % 2 == 0: ## [CONDITION](y % 2 == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return y
    if x == y: ## [CONDITION](x == y)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return -1
    return y - 1
