The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 12, y = 15 ).
`x` is 12 and `y` is 15.
The condition `x > y` is false (12 is not greater than 15).
The first if branch is not taken.
The condition `y % 2 == 0` is false (15 is not even).
The second if branch is not taken.
The condition `x == y` is false (12 is not equal to 15).
The third if branch is not taken.
The function returns `y - 1`, which is 14.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(12, 15)` is 14.
