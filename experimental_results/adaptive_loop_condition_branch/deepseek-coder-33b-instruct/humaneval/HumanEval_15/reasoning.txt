The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string that contains all integers from 0 to n (inclusive) separated by a space.

To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 0, we need to generate a string that contains all integers from 0 to 0 (inclusive).

Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 0 is "0".
