The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list A to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, ..., n.
    - For each j, k in the inner loop, check if the sum of A[i], A[j], A[k] is divisible by 3.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, ..., n.
    - For each j, k in the inner loop, check if the sum of A[i], A[j], A[k] is divisible by 3.

Last Iteration (i=n-1):
    - `i` is n-1, j in the inner loop is n.
    - For each j, k in the inner loop, check if the sum of A[i], A[j], A[k] is divisible by 3.
