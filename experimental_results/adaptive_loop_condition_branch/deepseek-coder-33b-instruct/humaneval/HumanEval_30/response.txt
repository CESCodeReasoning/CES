[REASONING]
The function get_positive takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the positive integers from the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6], we need to filter out the negative integers from the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6] is [4, 5, 6].

[OUTPUT]
[4, 5, 6]
