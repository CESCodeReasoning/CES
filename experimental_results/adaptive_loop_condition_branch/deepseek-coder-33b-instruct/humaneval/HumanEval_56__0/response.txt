[REASONING]
The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "<><><<><>><>>><>" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '<' is equal to "<", so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '<' is equal to "<", so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '<' is equal to "<", so depth becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes 0.
Iteration 7:
    -The character '<' is equal to "<", so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 8:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes 0.
Iteration 9:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes -1.
Iteration 10:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes -2.
Iteration 11:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes -3.
Iteration 12:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes -4.
Iteration 13:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes -5.
Iteration 14:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes -6.

    depth = 0
    for b in brackets: ## [STATE]b=['<', '>', '<', '<', '>', '>', '<', '>', '>', '>', '>', '>', '>'][/STATE][STATE]brackets=["<><><<><>><>>><>"][/STATE]

            depth += 1
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N, Y, N, N, Y, Y, N, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0: ## [CONDITION](depth < 0)=[False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            return False
    return depth == 0
