[REASONING]
The function `triangle_area` is called with ( a = 3, b = 4, c = 5 ).
The condition `a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a` is false, because `3 + 4 = 7 <= 5`, `3 + 5 = 8 <= 4`, and `4 + 5 = 9 <= 3` are all false.
The `else` branch is taken.
The semi-perimeter `s` is calculated as `(3 + 4 + 5)/2 = 6`.
The area is then calculated as `sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))`, which is `sqrt(6 * (6 - 3) * (6 - 4) * (6 - 5))`, which is `sqrt(54)`, which is `7.21`.
The area is then rounded to 2 decimal places, resulting in `7.21`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `triangle_area(3, 4, 5)` is `7.21`.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a: ## [CONDITION](a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a)=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](b + c <= a)=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](a + b <= c)=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](a + c <= b)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2    
    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
    area = round(area, 2)
    return area
