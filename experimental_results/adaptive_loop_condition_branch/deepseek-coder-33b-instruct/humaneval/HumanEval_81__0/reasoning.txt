The function `numerical_letter_grade` is called with ( grades = [1.2] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `letter_grade` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The gpa is 1.2, which falls into the last `elif` condition (`gpa > 0.0`).
    -The condition `gpa > 0.0` is true.
    -Action: `letter_grade.append("D-")` appends "D-" to `letter_grade`.

Return Statement
    -After the loop completes, the function returns the list `letter_grade`, which is now ["D-"].

Therefore, the final output of the function `numerical_letter_grade([1.2])` is ["D-"].
