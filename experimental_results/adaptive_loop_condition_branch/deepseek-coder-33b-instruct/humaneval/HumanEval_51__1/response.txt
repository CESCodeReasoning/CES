[REASONING]
The function remove_vowels takes a string text as input. It then creates a new string by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is not a vowel (i.e., it is not in the list ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]), it is included in the new string. The function then returns this new string.

To determine the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input "ybcd", we need to create a new string by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is not a vowel (i.e., it is not in the list ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]), it is included in the new string.

The characters in "ybcd" are "y", "b", "c", and "d". The only character that is not a vowel is "b", so the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input "ybcd" is "bd".
