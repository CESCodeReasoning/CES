[REASONING]
The function `change_base` is called with ( x = 234, base = 2 ).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to an empty string.
First Iteration:
    - x = 234, x > 0 is True.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "0".
    - `x //= base` updates `x` to 117.
Second Iteration:
    - x = 117, x > 0 is True.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "101".
    - `x //= base` updates `x` to 58.
Third Iteration:
    - x = 58, x > 0 is True.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "11010".
    - `x //= base` updates `x` to 29.
Fourth Iteration:
    - x = 29, x > 0 is True.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "11101".
    - `x //= base` updates `x` to 14.
Fifth Iteration:
    - x = 14, x > 0 is True.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "1110".
    - `x //= base` updates `x` to 7.
Sixth Iteration:
    - x = 7, x > 0 is True.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "111".
    - `x //= base` updates `x` to 3.
Seventh Iteration:
    - x = 3, x > 0 is True.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "11".
    - `x //= base` updates `x` to 1.
Eighth Iteration:
    - x = 1, x > 0 is True.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "1".
    - `x //= base` updates `x` to 0.
x is not greater than 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `ret`, which is now "1110110".

def change_base(x: int, base: int):
    ret = ""
    while x > 0: ## [STATE](x > 0)=[True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True][/STATE][STATE]x=[234, 117, 58, 29, 14, 7, 3, 1][/STATE]
        ret = str(x % base) + ret
        x //= base
    return ret
