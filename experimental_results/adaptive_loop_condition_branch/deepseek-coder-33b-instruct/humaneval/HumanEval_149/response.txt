[REASONING]
The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["aa", "a", "aaa"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order.

Iteration 1:
    -The string 'a' has an odd length, so it is not appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 2:
    -The string 'aa' has an even length, so it is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The string 'aaa' has an odd length, so it is not appended to `new_lst`.

After the loop, `new_lst` is sorted by length in ascending order.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sorted_list_sum(["aa", "a", "aaa"])` is ['aa'].

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    lst.sort()
    new_lst = []
    for i in lst: ## [STATE]i=['a', 'aa', 'aaa'][/STATE][STATE]lst=['a', 'aa', 'aaa'][/STATE]
        if len(i)%2 == 0: ## [CONDITION](len(i)%2 == 0)=[False, True, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, Y, N][/BRANCH]
            new_lst.append(i)
    return sorted(new_lst, key=len)
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
['aa']
