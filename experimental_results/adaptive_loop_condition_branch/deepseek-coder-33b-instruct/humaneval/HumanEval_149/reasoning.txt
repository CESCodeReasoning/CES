The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["aa", "a", "aaa"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order.

Iteration 1:
    -The string 'a' has an odd length, so it is not appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 2:
    -The string 'aa' has an even length, so it is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The string 'aaa' has an odd length, so it is not appended to `new_lst`.

After the loop, `new_lst` is sorted by length in ascending order.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sorted_list_sum(["aa", "a", "aaa"])` is ['aa'].
