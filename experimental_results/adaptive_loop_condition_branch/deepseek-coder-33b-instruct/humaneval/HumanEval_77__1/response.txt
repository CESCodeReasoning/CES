[REASONING]
The function iscube takes a number a as input and checks if it is a perfect cube.

The function first calculates the absolute value of a to handle negative numbers.

Then, it calculates the cube root of a using the ** operator (which raises a to the power of 1/3). The round function is used to round the result to the nearest integer.

The int function is used to convert the result to an integer.

Finally, it checks if the cube of the integer result is equal to a. If it is, it means a is a perfect cube, so the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function iscube on the input 0, we need to follow the steps above.

The absolute value of 0 is 0.

The cube root of 0 is 0.

The cube of 0 is 0.

Therefore, 0 is a perfect cube, so the function returns True.
