The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'a b b a' ).
Inside the function, a variable `dict1` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
The string `test` is split into a list `list1`.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'a' is in `list1` twice, so `t` becomes 2.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'b' is in `list1` twice, but `t` is already 2, so `t` remains 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'b' is in `list1` twice, but `t` is already 2, so `t` remains 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'a' is in `list1` twice, but `t` is already 2, so `t` remains 2.

After the loop, `t` is 2, which is greater than 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'a' is in `list1` twice, so it is added to `dict1` with a value of 2.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'b' is in `list1` twice, so it is added to `dict1` with a value of 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `histogram('a b b a')` is {'a': 2, 'b': 2}.
