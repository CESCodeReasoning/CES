[REASONING]
The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [0, 10, 20, 1000000] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 0 is added to `s`, which becomes -0.
    -Since `s` is not less than 0, `max_sum` remains 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 10 is added to `s`, which becomes -10.
    -Since `s` is less than 0, `s` is reset to 0.
    -`max_sum` remains 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 20 is added to `s`, which becomes -20.
    -Since `s` is less than 0, `s` is reset to 0.
    -`max_sum` remains 0.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 1000000 is added to `s`, which becomes -1000020.
    -Since `s` is less than 0, `s` is reset to 0.
    -`max_sum` remains 0.

Since `max_sum` is still 0 after the loop, the condition `max_sum == 0` is true.
Therefore, `max_sum` is set to the maximum negative number in `nums`, which is -0.

Finally, `min_sum` is set to -`max_sum`, which is 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([0, 10, 20, 1000000])` is 0.

from typing import *


def minSubArraySum(nums):
    max_sum = 0
    s = 0
    for num in nums: ## [STATE]num=[0, 10, 20, 1000000][/STATE][STATE]nums=[[0, 10, 20, 1000000]][/STATE]
        s += -num
        if (s < 0): ## [CONDITION](s < 0)=[False, False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            s = 0
        max_sum = max(s, max_sum)
    if max_sum == 0: ## [CONDITION](max_sum == 0)=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        max_sum = max(-i for i in nums)
    min_sum = -max_sum
    return min_sum
