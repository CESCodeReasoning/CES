[REASONING]
The function triangle_area takes two parameters: a and h. It calculates the area of a triangle using the formula: area = (base * height) / 2.

To calculate the area of a triangle with base 10 and height 8, we substitute a = 10 and h = 8 into the formula.

The calculation is: (10 * 8) / 2.0 = 40.0

Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (10, 8) is 40.0.
