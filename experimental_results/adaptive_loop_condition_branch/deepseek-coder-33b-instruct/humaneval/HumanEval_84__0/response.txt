[REASONING]
The function solve takes an integer N as input. It converts the integer N into a string, then iterates over each character in the string, converting it back into an integer and summing all these integers. The sum is then converted into a binary number (using the bin function) and the '0b' prefix is removed by slicing the string from the 2nd index onwards. The function finally returns this binary string.

To determine the output of executing the function solve on the input 963, we need to follow the steps outlined above.

1. Convert 963 to a string: "963"
2. Iterate over each character in the string, convert it back into an integer and sum all these integers: 9 + 6 + 3 = 18
3. Convert the sum (18) to a binary number: bin(18) = '0b10010'
4. Remove the '0b' prefix from the binary number: '0b10010'[2:] = '10010'

Therefore, the output of executing the function solve on the input 963 is "10010".
