[REASONING]
The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input. It first removes any duplicate values from the list by converting it to a set and then back to a list. It then sorts the list in ascending order. If the length of the list is less than 2, it returns None because there is no second smallest number. Otherwise, it returns the second element of the sorted list, which is the second smallest number.

To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [5, 1, 4, 3, 2], we first remove any duplicate values from the list to get [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Then, the second smallest number is 2, so the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [5, 1, 4, 3, 2] is 2.
