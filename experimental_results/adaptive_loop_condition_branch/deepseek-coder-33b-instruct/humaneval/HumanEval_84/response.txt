[REASONING]
The function solve takes an integer N as input. It converts the integer N into a string, then iterates over each character in the string, converting it back into an integer and summing all these integers. The sum is then converted into a binary number (using the bin function) and the '0b' prefix is removed by slicing the string from the 2nd index onwards. The function then returns this binary string.

To determine the output of executing the function solve on the input 1000, we need to follow the steps outlined above.

1. Convert the integer 1000 into a string: "1000".
2. Iterate over each character in the string, convert it back into an integer, and sum all these integers: 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.
3. Convert the sum (1) into a binary number: bin(1) returns '0b1'.
4. Remove the '0b' prefix from the binary string: '0b1'[2:] returns '1'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function solve on the input 1000 is '1'.
