[REASONING]
The function `by_length` is called with an empty list.
Inside the function, a dictionary `dic` is initialized with number-word pairs.
The list `sorted_arr` is sorted in descending order.
The loop iterates over the elements of `sorted_arr`. Since `sorted_arr` is empty, the loop does not execute.
The function returns `new_arr`, which is an empty list.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def by_length(arr):
    dic = {
        1: "One",
        2: "Two",
        3: "Three",
        4: "Four",
        5: "Five",
        6: "Six",
        7: "Seven",
        8: "Eight",
        9: "Nine",
    }
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    new_arr = []
    for var in sorted_arr: ## [STATE]sorted_arr=[][/STATE]
        try:
            new_arr.append(dic[var])
        except BaseException:
            pass
    return new_arr
