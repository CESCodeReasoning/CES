The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input. It uses the Counter class from the collections module to count the frequency of each number in the list. Then it returns a new list that contains only the numbers that appear once or not at all in the input list.

In the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5], the number 2 and 3 appear twice, so they are not included in the output list. The numbers 1, 4, and 5 appear only once, so they are included in the output list. Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5] is [1, 4, 5].
