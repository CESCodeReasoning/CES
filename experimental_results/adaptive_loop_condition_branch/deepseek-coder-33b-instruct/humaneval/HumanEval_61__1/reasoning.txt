The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "(" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is an opening bracket, so depth becomes 1.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `depth == 0`, which is False.
