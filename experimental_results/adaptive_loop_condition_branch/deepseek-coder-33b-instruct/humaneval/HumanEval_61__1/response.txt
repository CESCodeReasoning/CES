[REASONING]
The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "(" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is an opening bracket, so depth becomes 1.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `depth == 0`, which is False.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets: ## [STATE]b=['('][/STATE][STATE]brackets=["("][/STATE]
        if b == "(": ## [CONDITION](b == "(")=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
            depth += 1
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0: ## [CONDITION](depth < 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
            return False
    return depth == 0

[OUTPUT]
