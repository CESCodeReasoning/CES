The function reverse_delete takes a string s and a string c as input. It first removes all characters in c from s by using a list comprehension to iterate over each character in s and only keeping the characters that are not in c. Then it checks if the reversed string is the same as the original string. If it is, it returns the original string and True. If it's not, it returns the original string and False.

To determine the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcde" and "ae", we need to remove all characters in "ae" from "abcde". The resulting string is "bcd". Then we check if the reversed string is the same as the original string. In this case, "dcb" is not the same as "bcd", so the output is ("bcd", False).
