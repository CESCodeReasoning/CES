The function `fix_spaces` is called with ( text = "Exa   mple" ).
Inside the function, a variable `new_text` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates through each character in the string.
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - `i < len(text)` when i=0
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "E" ( "" + "E" = "E" ).
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - `i < len(text)` when i=1
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Ex" ( "E" + "x" = "Ex" ).
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - `i < len(text)` when i=2
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Exa" ( "Ex" + "a" = "Exa" ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - `i < len(text)` when i=3
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 1.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - `i < len(text)` when i=4
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 2.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - `i < len(text)` when i=5
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 3.
Seventh Iteration (i = 6):
    - `i < len(text)` when i=6
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += "_" * (end - start) + text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Exa___mple" ( "Exa" + "___" + "m" = "Exa___m" ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `new_text`, which is now "Exa___mple".
