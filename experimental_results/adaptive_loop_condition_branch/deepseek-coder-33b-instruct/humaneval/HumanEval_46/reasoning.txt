The function `fib4` is called with ( n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a list `results` is initialized to [0, 0, 2, 0].
The condition ( n < 4 ) is not satisfied, therefore the else branch is taken.
The loop iterates from 4 through 5 (since ( n = 5 )).
First Iteration (_ = 4):
    results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates `results` to [0, 0, 2, 0, 4] and results.pop(0) removes the first element from `results`.
Second Iteration (_ = 5):
    results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates `results` to [0, 2, 0, 4, 10] and results.pop(0) removes the first element from `results`.
After the loop completes, the function returns `results[-1]` which is 10 as the output.
