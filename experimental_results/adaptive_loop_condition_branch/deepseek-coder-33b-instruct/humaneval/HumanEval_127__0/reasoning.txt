The function `intersection` is called with ( interval1 = [-2, -2] and interval2 = [-3, -2] ).

The function `is_prime` checks if a number is prime.

The function `intersection` calculates the intersection of two intervals.

The intersection of two intervals is defined as the interval that contains all points that are in both intervals.

In this case, the intersection of [-2, -2] and [-3, -2] is [-2, -2].

The length of this intersection is 0.

Since 0 is not a prime number, the function `intersection` returns "NO".
