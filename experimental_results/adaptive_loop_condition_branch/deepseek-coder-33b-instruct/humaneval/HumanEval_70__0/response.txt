[REASONING]
The function `strange_sort_list` is called with ( lst = [] ).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list and `switch` is initialized to True.
The while loop is entered, but since `lst` is empty, the loop condition is False and the loop is not executed.
The function returns the value of `res`, which is an empty list.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def strange_sort_list(lst):
    res, switch = [], True
    while lst: ## [STATE]lst=[[][/STATE]
        res.append(min(lst) if switch else max(lst))
        lst.remove(res[-1])
        switch = not switch
    return res
