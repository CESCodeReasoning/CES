The function select_words(s, n) takes a string s and an integer n as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each word in the string s.
For each word, it counts the number of consonants in the word.
If the number of consonants equals to n, it appends the word to the result list.
First Iteration (word="Mary"):
    - `word` is "Mary", i in the inner loop is 0, 1, 2, 3.
    - `n_consonants` is 2.
    - "Mary" does not have 3 consonants, so it is not appended to the result list.
Second Iteration (word="had"):
    - `word` is "had", i in the inner loop is 0, 1, 2.
    - `n_consonants` is 1.
    - "had" does not have 3 consonants, so it is not appended to the result list.
Third Iteration (word="a"):
    - `word` is "a", i in the inner loop is 0.
    - `n_consonants` is 0.
    - "a" does not have 3 consonants, so it is not appended to the result list.
Fourth Iteration (word="little"):
    - `word` is "little", i in the inner loop is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
    - `n_consonants` is 4.
    - "little" has 4 consonants, so it is appended to the result list.
Fifth Iteration (word="lamb"):
    - `word` is "lamb", i in the inner loop is 0, 1, 2, 3.
    - `n_consonants` is 2.
    - "lamb" does not have 3 consonants, so it is not appended to the result list.
