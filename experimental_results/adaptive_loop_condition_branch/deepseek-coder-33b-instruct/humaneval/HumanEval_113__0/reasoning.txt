The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['3',"11111111"] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `res` is initialized.
The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.

First Iteration(arr = '3'):
    The sum of odd digits in '3' is 1.
    The string 'the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.' is appended to `res`.
Second Iteration(arr = "11111111"):
    The sum of odd digits in "11111111" is 8.
    The string 'the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput.' is appended to `res`.
