The function add_elements takes an array arr and an integer k as input. It returns the sum of the first k elements in arr that have a string representation with a length of 2 or less.

To determine the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99] and 3, we need to sum the first 3 elements in the array that have a string representation with a length of 2 or less.

The first 3 elements in the array are 1, -2, and -3. The string representation of -2 and -3 has a length of 2, so they are included in the sum. The string representation of 1 has a length of 1, so it is not included in the sum.

Therefore, the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99] and 3 is -5.
