[REASONING]
The function compare takes two lists, game and guess, as input. It returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists.

To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input [[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]], we need to calculate the absolute difference between corresponding elements of the two lists.

The first pair of elements are 0 and 0, so the absolute difference is 0.
The second pair of elements are 0 and 0, so the absolute difference is 0.
The third pair of elements are 0 and 0, so the absolute difference is 0.
The fourth pair of elements are 0 and 0, so the absolute difference is 0.
The fifth pair of elements are 0 and 0, so the absolute difference is 0.
The sixth pair of elements are 0 and 0, so the absolute difference is 0.

Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input [[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]] is [0,0,0,0,0,0].
