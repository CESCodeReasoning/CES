[REASONING]
The function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter takes a string txt as input. It splits the string into a list of words using the split(' ') method. The last word in the list is then accessed using the index -1.

The function then checks if the length of the last word is 1 (i.e., it's a single character) and if the ASCII value of the lowercase version of the last character is between 97 and 122 (inclusive), which are the ASCII values for lowercase letters.

If both conditions are met, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter on the input "apple", we need to follow the steps above.

The last word in the string "apple" is "apple". The length of "apple" is 5, so the first condition is not met. Therefore, the function returns False.
