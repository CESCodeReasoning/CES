[REASONING]
The function filter_integers takes a list of any type of values as input and returns a list of integers.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [], we need to filter out all non-integer values from the list.
Since there are no elements in the input list, there are no integers to filter out.
Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [] is [].
