The function make_a_pile takes an integer n as input and returns a list of integers. The list is created using a list comprehension, which generates a sequence of numbers.

The sequence is generated by the formula n + 2 * i for i in range(n). This formula calculates the value of n plus twice the current index i for each index i in the range from 0 to n-1.

For example, if n is 6, the sequence would be:
6 (n), 8 (n + 2*1), 10 (n + 2*2), 12 (n + 2*3), 14 (n + 2*4), 16 (n + 2*5).

So, the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 6 is [6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16].
