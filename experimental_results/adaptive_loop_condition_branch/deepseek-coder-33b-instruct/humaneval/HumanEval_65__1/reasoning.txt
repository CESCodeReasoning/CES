The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 12, shift = 1 ).
`shift` is 1, which is not greater than the length of the string representation of `x` (2).
The condition `shift > len(s)` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
The method returns the string `s` shifted by `shift` places to the right.

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(12, 1)` is "21".
