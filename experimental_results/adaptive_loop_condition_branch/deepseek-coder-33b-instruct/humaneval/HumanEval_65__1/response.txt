[REASONING]
The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 12, shift = 1 ).
`shift` is 1, which is not greater than the length of the string representation of `x` (2).
The condition `shift > len(s)` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
The method returns the string `s` shifted by `shift` places to the right.

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(12, 1)` is "21".

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s): ## [CONDITION](shift > len(s))=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return s[::-1]
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return s[len(s) - shift:] + s[:len(s) - shift]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
"21"
