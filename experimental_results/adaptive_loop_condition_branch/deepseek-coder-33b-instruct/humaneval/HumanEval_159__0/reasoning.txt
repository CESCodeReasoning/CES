The function `eat` is called with ( number = 4, need = 5, remaining = 1 ).
`need` is less than or equal to `remaining`, therefore the if branch is taken.
The action: `return [number + need, remaining - need]` results in `[4 + 5, 1 - 5]` which is `[9, -4]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `eat(4, 5, 1)` is `[9, -4]`.
