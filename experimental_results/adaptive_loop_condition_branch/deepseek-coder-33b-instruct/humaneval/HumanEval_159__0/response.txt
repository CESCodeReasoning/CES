[REASONING]
The function `eat` is called with ( number = 4, need = 5, remaining = 1 ).
`need` is less than or equal to `remaining`, therefore the if branch is taken.
The action: `return [number + need, remaining - need]` results in `[4 + 5, 1 - 5]` which is `[9, -4]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `eat(4, 5, 1)` is `[9, -4]`.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def eat(number, need, remaining):
    if (need <= remaining): ## [CONDITION](need <= remaining)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return [number + need, remaining - need]
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return [number + remaining, 0]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[9, -4]
[/OUTPUT]
