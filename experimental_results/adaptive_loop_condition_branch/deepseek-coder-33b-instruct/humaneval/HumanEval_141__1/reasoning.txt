The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = '@this1_is6_valid.exe' ).
The file name is split into two parts by the '.' separator.
The condition `len(lst) != 2` is false, so the if branch is not taken.
The second part of the file name is checked against the list of valid suffixes. It is 'exe', which is in the list, so the if branch is not taken.
The first part of the file name is checked to see if it is empty. It is not, so the if branch is not taken.
The first character of the first part of the file name is checked to see if it is a letter. It is not, so the if branch is taken and the method returns 'No'.
Therefore, the final output of the function `file_name_check('@this1_is6_valid.exe')` is 'No'.
