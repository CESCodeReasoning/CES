The function `solve` is called with ( s = "#a@C" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` is initialized to 0.
A variable `idx` is initialized to 0.
A list `new_str` is created from the string `s`.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '#' is not an alphabet, so `flg` remains 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'a' is an alphabet, so `flg` becomes 1 and the character is swapped to 'A'.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '@' is not an alphabet, so `flg` remains 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'C' is an alphabet, so `flg` remains 1 and the character is swapped to 'c'.

The string `s` is recreated from the list `new_str`.

Since `flg` is 1, the string `s` is returned as is.
