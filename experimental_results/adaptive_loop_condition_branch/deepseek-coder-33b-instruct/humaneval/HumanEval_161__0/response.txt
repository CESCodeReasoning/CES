[REASONING]
The function `solve` is called with ( s = "#a@C" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` is initialized to 0.
A variable `idx` is initialized to 0.
A list `new_str` is created from the string `s`.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '#' is not an alphabet, so `flg` remains 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'a' is an alphabet, so `flg` becomes 1 and the character is swapped to 'A'.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '@' is not an alphabet, so `flg` remains 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'C' is an alphabet, so `flg` remains 1 and the character is swapped to 'c'.

The string `s` is recreated from the list `new_str`.

Since `flg` is 1, the string `s` is returned as is.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def solve(s):
    flg = 0
    idx = 0
    new_str = list(s)
    for i in s: ## [STATE]i=['#', 'a', '@', 'C'][/STATE][STATE]s=["#a@C"][/STATE]
        if i.isalpha(): ## [CONDITION](i.isalpha())=[False, True, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, Y, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            new_str[idx] = i.swapcase()
            flg = 1
        idx += 1
    s = ""
    for i in new_str: ## [STATE]i=['#', 'A', '@', 'c'][/STATE][STATE]new_str=["#A@c"][/STATE]
        s += i
    if flg == 0: ## [CONDITION](flg == 0)=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return s[len(s)::-1]
    return s
