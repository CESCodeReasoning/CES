[REASONING]
The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input. It splits the string s into a list of words using the split(' ') method. Then, for each word in the list, it converts the word into a list of characters using the list(i) method, sorts the list of characters using the sorted() function, and then joins the sorted list of characters back into a string using the ''.join() method. Finally, it joins all the sorted words back into a string using the ' '.join() method.

To determine the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input 'Hello World!!!', we need to follow the steps above.

1. Split 'Hello World!!!' into ['Hello', 'World!!!']
2. For each word in the list, sort the characters: ['Hello' -> 'HellO', 'World!!!' -> 'WorlOd!!!']
3. Join the sorted words back into a string: 'HellO WorlOd!!!'

Therefore, the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input 'Hello World!!!' is 'HellO WorlOd!!!'.
