The function `will_it_fly` is called with ( q = [1, 2, 3], w = 6 ).
The condition `sum(q) > w` is false, so the first branch is not taken.
The loop iterates from 0 through 1 (since len(q) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1).
First Iteration (i = 0, j = 1):
    - `i < j` is true.
    - The condition `q[i] != q[j]` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - The function returns False.
