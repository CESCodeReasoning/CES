The function `change_base` is called with ( x = 9, base = 3 ).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to an empty string.
First Iteration:
    - x = 9, x > 0 is True.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "0".
    - `x //= base` updates `x` to 3.
Second Iteration:
    - x = 3, x > 0 is True.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "00".
    - `x //= base` updates `x` to 1.
Third Iteration:
    - x = 1, x > 0 is True.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "001".
    - `x //= base` updates `x` to 0.
x is no longer greater than 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `ret`, which is now "001".
