The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [135, 103, 31] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `odd_digit_elements` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 135 is not all odd digits, so it is not added to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 103 is not all odd digits, so it is not added to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 31 is all odd digits, so it is added to `odd_digit_elements`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the sorted list of `odd_digit_elements`, which is [31].
