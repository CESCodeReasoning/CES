[REASONING]
The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string that contains all integers from 0 to n (inclusive) separated by a space.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3, we need to generate a string that contains all integers from 0 to 3 (inclusive) separated by a space.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3 is "0 1 2 3".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"0 1 2 3"
[/OUTPUT]
