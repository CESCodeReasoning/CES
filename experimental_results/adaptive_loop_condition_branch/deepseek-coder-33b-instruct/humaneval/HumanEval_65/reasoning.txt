The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 100, shift = 2 ).
`s` is the string representation of `x`, which is "100".
The condition `shift > len(s)` is false, because `shift` (2) is not greater than the length of `s` (3).
The else branch is taken, and the function returns the string `s[len(s) - shift:] + s[:len(s) - shift]`.
This is equivalent to "100"[3 - 2 :] + "100"[:3 - 2], which is "00" + "1" = "001".

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(100, 2)` is "001".
