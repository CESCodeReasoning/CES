The function sort_array takes an array arr as input. It first sorts the array in ascending order. Then it sorts the sorted array again, but this time it sorts it based on the number of 1's in the binary representation of each number.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4], we need to follow the steps:

1. Sort the array in ascending order: [1,2,3,4,5]
2. Sort the sorted array again, but this time based on the number of 1's in the binary representation of each number:
    - 1 in binary is 1, so it has 1 one.
    - 2 in binary is 10, so it has 1 one.
    - 3 in binary is 11, so it has 2 ones.
    - 4 in binary is 100, so it has 1 one.
    - 5 in binary is 101, so it has 2 ones.

So, the sorted array based on the number of 1's in the binary representation of each number is [1,2,4,3,5].

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4] is [1,2,4,3,5].
