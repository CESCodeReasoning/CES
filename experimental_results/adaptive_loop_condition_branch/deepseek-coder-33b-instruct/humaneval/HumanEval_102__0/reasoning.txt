The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 13, y = 12 ).
`x` is 13 and `y` is 12.
The condition `x > y` is false, so the if branch is not taken.
The condition `y % 2 == 0` is also false, so the next if branch is not taken.
The condition `x == y` is false, so the next if branch is not taken.
The function returns `y - 1`, which is 11.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(13, 12)` is 11.
