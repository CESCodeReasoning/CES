[REASONING]
The function derivative takes a list of numbers xs as input. It then enumerates over the list, multiplying each number by its index. The result is a new list where each element is the product of the number at that index and its index. The [1:] at the end of the list comprehension is used to exclude the first element of the list, as the derivative of the first element is undefined.

To determine the output of executing the function derivative on the input [3, 2, 1], we need to enumerate over the list [3, 2, 1] and multiply each number by its index. The resulting list is [0*3, 1*2, 2*1] which equals [0, 2, 2].
