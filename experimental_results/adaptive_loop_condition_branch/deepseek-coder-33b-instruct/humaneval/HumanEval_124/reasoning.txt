The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '03-11-2000' ).
The date string is stripped of leading and trailing spaces.
The date string is split into month, day, and year components.
The month, day, and year are converted to integers.
The month is checked to see if it is between 1 and 12.
   - The month is 3, which satisfies ( 1 <= month <= 12 ).
   - The condition `month < 1 or month > 12` is false.
The day is checked to see if it is valid for the month.
   - The month is 3, which is not in [1,3,5,7,8,10,12], so the condition `month in [1,3,5,7,8,10,12] and day < 1 or day > 31` is false.
   - The month is 3, which is not in [4,6,9,11], so the condition `month in [4,6,9,11] and day < 1 or day > 30` is false.
   - The month is 3, which is not 2, so the condition `month == 2 and day < 1 or day > 29` is false.
The function returns True, indicating that the date is valid.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('03-11-2000')` is True.
