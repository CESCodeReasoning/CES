The function `move_one_ball` is called with ( arr = [3, 5, 4, 1, 2] ).

First, it checks if the length of the array is 0.
   - The condition `len(arr) == 0` is false.
   - The `else` block is executed.

Next, it sorts the array and finds the minimum value and its index.

Then, it creates a new array `my_arr` by moving the elements from the beginning of the original array to the position of the minimum value.

Finally, it checks if each element in `my_arr` is equal to the corresponding element in the sorted array.
   - For the first element, `my_arr[0]` is 1 and `sorted_array[0]` is also 1, so the condition `my_arr[i] != sorted_array[i]` is false.
   - For the second element, `my_arr[1]` is 2 and `sorted_array[1]` is also 2, so the condition is false.
   - For the third element, `my_arr[2]` is 3 and `sorted_array[2]` is also 3, so the condition is false.
   - For the fourth element, `my_arr[3]` is 4 and `sorted_array[3]` is also 4, so the condition is false.
   - For the fifth element, `my_arr[4]` is 5 and `sorted_array[4]` is also 5, so the condition is false.

Since all elements are equal, the function returns `True`.
