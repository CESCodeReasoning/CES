The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input. It splits the string s into a list of words using the split() method. Then, for each word in the list, it converts the word into a list of characters, sorts the list, and joins the characters back into a string. Finally, it joins all the sorted words back into a string with spaces in between.

To determine the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input '', we need to follow the steps above.

The input '' is split into an empty list of words. Then, for each word in the list, it converts the word into a list of characters, sorts the list, and joins the characters back into a string. Finally, it joins all the sorted words back into a string with spaces in between.

Since there are no words in the input '', the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input '' is ''.
