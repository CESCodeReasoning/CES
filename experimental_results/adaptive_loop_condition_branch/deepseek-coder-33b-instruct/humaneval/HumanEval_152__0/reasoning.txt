The function compare takes two lists, game and guess, as input. It returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists.

To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input ([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4]), we need to calculate the absolute difference between corresponding elements of the two lists.

The first element of game is 1 and the first element of guess is -1. The absolute difference between 1 and -1 is 2.
The second element of game is 2 and the second element of guess is 2. The absolute difference between 2 and 2 is 0.
The third element of game is 3 and the third element of guess is 3. The absolute difference between 3 and 3 is 0.
The fourth element of game is 5 and the fourth element of guess is 4. The absolute difference between 5 and 4 is 1.

Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input ([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4]) is [2, 0, 0, 1].
