[REASONING]
The function incr_list takes a list l as input and returns a new list where each element of l is incremented by 1.
To determine the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [], we need to increment each element of [] by 1.
Since there are no elements in the list, there is no incrementation to be done.
Therefore, the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [] is [].

[OUTPUT]

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"


def incr_list(l: list):
    return [(e + 1) for e in l]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
print(f("hi"))
print(incr_list([]))
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
