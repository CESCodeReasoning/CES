The function incr_list takes a list l as input and returns a new list where each element of l is incremented by 1.
To determine the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [], we need to increment each element of [] by 1.
Since there are no elements in the list, there is no incrementation to be done.
Therefore, the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [] is [].
