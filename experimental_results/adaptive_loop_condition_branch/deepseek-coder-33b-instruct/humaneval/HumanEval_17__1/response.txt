[REASONING]
The function parse_music takes a string music_string as input. It first defines a dictionary note_map where the keys are the musical notes and the values are the corresponding integer values.

The function then splits the input string music_string into a list of substrings using the space character as the delimiter. It then iterates over each substring in the list. If the substring is not empty (i.e., it is not a space character), it looks up the substring in the note_map dictionary and appends the corresponding integer value to the result list.

To determine the output of executing the function parse_music on the input ".| .| .| .", we need to split the input string into substrings and look up each substring in the note_map dictionary.

The input string ".| .| .| ." is split into the substrings ['.|', '.|', '.|'] and the corresponding integer values are [1, 1, 1]. Therefore, the output of executing the function parse_music on the input ".| .| .| ." is [1, 1, 1].
