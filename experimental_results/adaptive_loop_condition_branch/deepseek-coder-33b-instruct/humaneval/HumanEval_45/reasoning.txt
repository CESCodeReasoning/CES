The function triangle_area takes two parameters: a and h. It calculates the area of a triangle using the formula: area = (base * height) / 2.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input 5 and 3, we need to substitute a = 5 and h = 3 into the formula.
Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input 5 and 3 is (5 * 3) / 2 = 7.5.
