[REASONING]
The function add takes a list of integers as input. It then creates a new list that includes only the elements at odd indices (1-indexed) that are even. It then returns the sum of this new list.

In the given list [4, 88], the element at index 1 (0-indexed) is 88, which is even. Therefore, the new list is [88]. The sum of this list is 88.
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
88
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"

def add(lst):
    return sum([lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i]%2 == 0])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
print(f("hi"))
print(add([4, 88]))
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The first line of the input is calling the function f with the string "hi". This concatenates "hi" with "a" to get "hia".
The second line of the input is calling the function add with the list [4, 88]. This function creates a new list that includes only the elements at odd indices (1-indexed) that are even. In this case, the only element at an odd index that is even is 88. Therefore, the new list is [88]. The sum of this list is 88.
