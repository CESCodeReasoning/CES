The function `rounded_avg` is called with ( n = 1, m = 5 ).
The condition ( m < n ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken.
A variable `summation` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( n = 1, m = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 3 ( 1 + 2 = 3 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 6 ( 3 + 3 = 6 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 10 ( 6 + 4 = 10 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 15 ( 10 + 5 = 15 ).
After the loop completes, the function calculates the average of the numbers from n to m ( 15 / (5 - 1 + 1) = 3 ) and returns the binary representation of the rounded average ( bin(round(3)) = '0b11' ).
