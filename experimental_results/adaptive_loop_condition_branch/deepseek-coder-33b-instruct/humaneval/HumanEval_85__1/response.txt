[REASONING]
The function add takes a list of integers as input. It then creates a new list that includes every second element of the input list starting from the second element (index 1), only if the element is even. It then returns the sum of this new list.

To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 4, 6, 8], we need to consider the second and fourth elements of the list (index 1 and 3). The second element is 4, which is even, so it is included in the new list. The fourth element is 8, which is also even, so it is also included in the new list.

The sum of the new list is 4 + 8 = 12. Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 4, 6, 8] is 12.
