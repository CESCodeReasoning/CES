[REASONING]
The function filter_integers takes a list of values as input. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each value in the list. For each value, it checks if the value is an instance of the int class using the isinstance function. If the value is an integer, it is included in the output list.

In the given input, the list contains integers (4 and 23.2), a dictionary ({}), a list ([]), and a string ('adasd'). The function filter_integers will return a list containing only the integers from the input list, which are 4 and 9.
