[REASONING]
The function parse_music takes a string music_string as input. It then creates a dictionary note_map where the keys are musical notes and the values are their corresponding integer values. The function then splits the input string into a list of notes using the split() method. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list of notes, and for each note, it retrieves its corresponding integer value from the note_map dictionary. The function returns a list of these integer values.

In the case of the input ''. The function splits the input string into an empty list, as there are no spaces in the string. The list comprehension then iterates over this empty list, and since there are no elements to iterate over, it returns an empty list.
