The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "2/4", n = "8/4" ).
The function splits the input strings into numerators and denominators.
The numerator and denominator are then multiplied together.
The condition `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` is checked.
Here, `numerator` is 2 * 8 = 16 and `denom` is 4 * 4 = 16.
16 / 16 = 1, which is an integer.
The condition is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("2/4", "8/4")` is True.
