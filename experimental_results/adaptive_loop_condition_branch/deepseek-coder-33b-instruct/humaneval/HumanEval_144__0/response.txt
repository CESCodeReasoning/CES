[REASONING]
The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "2/4", n = "8/4" ).
The function splits the input strings into numerators and denominators.
The numerator and denominator are then multiplied together.
The condition `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` is checked.
Here, `numerator` is 2 * 8 = 16 and `denom` is 4 * 4 = 16.
16 / 16 = 1, which is an integer.
The condition is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("2/4", "8/4")` is True.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def simplify(x, n):
    a, b = x.split("/")
    c, d = n.split("/")
    numerator = int(a) * int(c)
    denom = int(b) * int(d)
    if (numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)): ## [CONDITION](numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom))=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return True
    return False
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
True
