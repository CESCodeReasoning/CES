The function `exchange` is called with ( lst1 = [3, 2, 6, 1, 8, 9] and lst2 = [3, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 3 is odd, so odd becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 2 is even, so even becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 6 is even, so even becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 1 is odd, so odd becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The number 8 is even, so even becomes 3.
Iteration 6:
    -The number 9 is odd, so odd becomes 3.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 3 is even, so even becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 5 is odd, so odd becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 5 is odd, so odd becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 1 is odd, so odd becomes 3.
Iteration 5:
    -The number 1 is odd, so odd becomes 4.
Iteration 6:
    -The number 1 is odd, so odd becomes 5.

Finally, the condition `even >= odd` is checked.
Since `even` (3) is greater than or equal to `odd` (5), the function returns "YES".
