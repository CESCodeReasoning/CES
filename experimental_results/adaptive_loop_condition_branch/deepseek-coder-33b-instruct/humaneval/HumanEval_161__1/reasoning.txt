The function `solve` is called with ( s = "ab" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` is initialized to 0, `idx` is initialized to 0, and `new_str` is initialized to a list of characters in `s`.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'a' is an alphabet, so it is swapped to 'A' and `flg` is set to 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'b' is an alphabet, so it is swapped to 'B'.

After the loop, `s` is converted back to a string from `new_str`.

Since `flg` is not 0, the function returns `s`, which is "AB".
