[REASONING]
The function decimal_to_binary takes a decimal number as input and returns a string that represents the binary equivalent of the input number.

The function uses the built-in Python function bin() to convert the decimal number to binary. The bin() function returns a string that starts with "0b" to indicate that it's a binary number, so we use [2:] to slice off the first two characters.

To determine the output of executing the function decimal_to_binary on the input 103, we need to convert 103 to binary and add "db" at the beginning and end of the binary string.

The binary representation of 103 is "1101001", so the output of executing the function decimal_to_binary on the input 103 is "db1101001db".
