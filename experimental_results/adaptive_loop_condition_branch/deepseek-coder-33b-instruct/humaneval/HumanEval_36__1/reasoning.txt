The function `fizz_buzz` is called with ( n = 200 ).
Inside the function, an empty list `ns` is initialized.
The loop iterates from 0 through 199 (since ( n = 200 )).
For each iteration, the number is checked if it is divisible by 11 or 13.
If it is, the number is appended to the list `ns`.
After the loop, the list `ns` is converted to a string `s`.
Then, for each character in the string `s`, if the character is '7', `ans` is incremented by 1.
Finally, the function returns the value of `ans`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fizz_buzz(200)` is the count of '7's in the numbers divisible by 11 or 13 from 0 to 199.
