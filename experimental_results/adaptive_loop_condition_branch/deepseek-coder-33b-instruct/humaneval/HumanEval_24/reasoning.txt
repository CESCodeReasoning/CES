The function `largest_divisor` is called with ( n = 3 ).

Iteration 1:
    -The number '3' is not divisible by '3', so the loop continues.
Iteration 2:
    -The number '3' is not divisible by '2', so the loop continues.
Iteration 3:
    -The number '3' is divisible by '1', so the function returns '1'.
