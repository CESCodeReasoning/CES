The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 33, y = 12354 ).
`x` is 33 and `y` is 12354.
The condition `x > y` is false, so the if branch is not taken.
The condition `y % 2 == 0` is also false, so the if branch is not taken.
The condition `x == y` is also false, so the if branch is not taken.
The function returns `y - 1`, which is 12353.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(33, 12354)` is 12353.
