[REASONING]
The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "(()())" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is an opening bracket, so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is an opening bracket, so depth becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ')' is a closing bracket, so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '(' is an opening bracket, so depth becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ')' is a closing bracket, so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ')' is a closing bracket, so depth becomes 0.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `depth == 0`, which is True.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets: ## [STATE]brackets=['(', '(', ')', '(', ')', ')'][/STATE]
        if b == "(": ## [CONDITION](b == "(")=[True, True, False, True, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y, N, Y, N, N][/BRANCH]
            depth += 1
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N, N, Y, N, Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0: ## [CONDITION](depth < 0)=[False, False, False, False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            return False
    return depth == 0
