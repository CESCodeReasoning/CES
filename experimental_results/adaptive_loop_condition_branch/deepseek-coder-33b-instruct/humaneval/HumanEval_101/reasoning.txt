The function `words_string` is called with ( s = "Hi, my name is John" ).

First Iteration:
    - The condition `not s` is False, so the `else` block is executed.
    - The character 'H' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Second Iteration:
    - The character 'i' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Third Iteration:
    - The character ',' is equal to ',', so a space is appended to `s_list`.
Fourth Iteration:
    - The character ' ' (space) is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Fifth Iteration:
    - The character 'm' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Sixth Iteration:
    - The character 'y' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Seventh Iteration:
    - The character ' ' (space) is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Eighth Iteration:
    - The character 'n' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Ninth Iteration:
    - The character 'a' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Tenth Iteration:
    - The character 'm' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Eleventh Iteration:
    - The character 'e' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Twelfth Iteration:
    - The character ' ' (space) is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Thirteenth Iteration:
    - The character 'i' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Fourteenth Iteration:
    - The character 's' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Fifteenth Iteration:
    - The character ' ' (space) is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Sixteenth Iteration:
    - The character 'J' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Seventeenth Iteration:
    - The character 'o' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Eighteenth Iteration:
    - The character 'h' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Nineteenth Iteration:
