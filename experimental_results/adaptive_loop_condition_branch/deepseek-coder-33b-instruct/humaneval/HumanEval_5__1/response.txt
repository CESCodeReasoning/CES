        return []

    result = []

    for n in numbers[:-1]: ## [STATE]n=[2, 2][/STATE][STATE]numbers[:(- 1)]=[2, 2, 2][/STATE]
        result.append(n)
        result.append(delimeter)

    result.append(numbers[-1])

    return result
[/ANSWER]

[REASONING]
The function `intersperse` is called with ( numbers = [2, 2, 2], delimeter = 2 ).
The condition (not numbers) is not satisfied, therefore the else branch is taken.
The loop iterates over the list `numbers` excluding the last element.
First Iteration (n = 2):
    n is appended to `result`, then `delimeter` is appended to `result`.
Second Iteration (n = 2):
    n is appended to `result`, then `delimeter` is appended to `result`.
The last element of `numbers` (2) is appended to `result`.
Finally, `result` is returned as the output.
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
[/OUTPUT]
