[REASONING]
The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input. It uses the Counter class from the collections module to count the frequency of each number in the list. Then it returns a new list that contains only the numbers that appear once or not at all in the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [], we need to count the frequency of each number in the list. Since the list is empty, there are no numbers to count, so the output is an empty list.
