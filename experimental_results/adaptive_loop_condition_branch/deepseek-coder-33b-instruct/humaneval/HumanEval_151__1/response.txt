[REASONING]
The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input. It then iterates over each number in the list. For each number, it checks if the number is positive, odd, and does not contain a decimal point. If the number satisfies all these conditions, it squares the number and adds it to the sum.

In the given input, the list is empty. Therefore, the function will return 0 as there are no numbers in the list that satisfy the conditions.
