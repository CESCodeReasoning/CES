[REASONING]
The function triples_sum_to_zero(l) takes a list of numbers([1, 2, 3, 7]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
In the innermost loop, for each element indexed by j in the inner loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3.
    - For j=1, k in the innermost loop is 2, 3.
    - l[i]+l[j]+l[k] = 1+2+3 = 6 != 0, the if branch is not taken.
    - For j=2, k in the innermost loop is 3.
    - l[i]+l[j]+l[k] = 1+3+7 = 11 != 0, the if branch is not taken.
    - For j=3, k in the innermost loop is 3.
    - l[i]+l[j]+l[k] = 1+7+3 = 11 != 0, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3.
    - For j=2, k in the innermost loop is 3.
    - l[i]+l[j]+l[k] = 2+3+7 = 12 != 0, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3.
    - For j=3, k in the innermost loop is 3.
    - l[i]+l[j]+l[k] = 3+7+3 = 13 != 0, the if branch is not taken.
Fourth iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, no more elements to compare.
No triples sum to zero, return False.
