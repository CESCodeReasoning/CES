The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "bYe" ).
The string "bYe" has 2 vowels ('e' and 'Y').
The condition `s[-1] == 'y' or s[-1] == 'Y'` is true, because the last character of the string is 'Y'.
The action: `n_vowels += 1` updates `n_vowels` to 3 (`2 + 1 = 3`).
Return Statement
   - After the if-else block, the function returns the value of `n_vowels`, which is now 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("bYe")` is 3.
