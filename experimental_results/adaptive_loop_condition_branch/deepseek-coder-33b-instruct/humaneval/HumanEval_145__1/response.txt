[REASONING]
The function `order_by_points` is called with an empty list (nums = []).
The function `order_by_points` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where the numbers are sorted based on the sum of their digits.

The function `digits_sum` is defined inside `order_by_points`. It takes an integer as input and returns the sum of its digits.

The `sorted` function is used to sort the list `nums`. The `key` argument is set to `digits_sum`, which means that the list will be sorted based on the sum of the digits of the numbers in the list.

Since the input list is empty, the output will also be an empty list.

Therefore, the final output of the function `order_by_points([])` is an empty list [].
