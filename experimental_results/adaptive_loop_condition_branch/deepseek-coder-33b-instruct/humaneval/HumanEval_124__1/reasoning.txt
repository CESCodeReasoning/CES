The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '04-2003' ).
The date string is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.
The date string is split into month, day, and year using the '-' as the delimiter.
The month, day, and year are converted from string to integer.
The month is checked to be between 1 and 12. If not, the function returns False.
The day is checked to be between 1 and 31 for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12. If not, the function returns False.
The day is checked to be between 1 and 30 for months 4, 6, 9, 11. If not, the function returns False.
The day is checked to be between 1 and 29 for month 2. If not, the function returns False.
If any of the above checks fail, the function returns False.
If all checks pass, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('04-2003')` is False.
