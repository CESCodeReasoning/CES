The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = 'I563_No.exe' ).
The file name is split into two parts by the '.' separator.
The length of the resulting list is checked. If it's not 2, the function returns 'No'.
The second part of the file name is checked to see if it's in the list of valid suffixes. If it's not, the function returns 'No'.
The first part of the file name is checked to see if it's empty. If it is, the function returns 'No'.
The first character of the first part of the file name is checked to see if it's a letter. If it's not, the function returns 'No'.
The number of digits in the first part of the file name is counted. If it's more than 3, the function returns 'No'.
If all these conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `file_name_check('I563_No.exe')` is 'Yes'.
