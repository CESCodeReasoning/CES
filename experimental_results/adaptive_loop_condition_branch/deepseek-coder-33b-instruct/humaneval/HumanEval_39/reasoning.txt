The function `prime_fib` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, a list `f` is initialized with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1).
The function `is_prime` checks if a number is prime.
The loop continues until `n` is 0.
First Iteration:
    - The last Fibonacci number is 1, which is not prime.
Second Iteration:
    - The last Fibonacci number is 1, which is not prime.
Third Iteration:
    - The last Fibonacci number is 2, which is prime.
    - `n` is decremented to 0.
Fourth Iteration:
    - The last Fibonacci number is 3, which is prime.
    - `n` is decremented to -1.
The loop continues until `n` is 0.
After the loop completes, the function returns the last Fibonacci number, which is 3.
