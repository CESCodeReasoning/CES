[REASONING]
The function `prime_fib` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, a list `f` is initialized with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1).
The function `is_prime` checks if a number is prime.
The loop continues until `n` is 0.
First Iteration:
    - The last Fibonacci number is 1, which is not prime.
Second Iteration:
    - The last Fibonacci number is 1, which is not prime.
Third Iteration:
    - The last Fibonacci number is 2, which is prime.
    - `n` is decremented to 0.
Fourth Iteration:
    - The last Fibonacci number is 3, which is prime.
    - `n` is decremented to -1.
The loop continues until `n` is 0.
After the loop completes, the function returns the last Fibonacci number, which is 3.

from typing import *
def prime_fib(n: int):
    import math

    def is_prime(p):
        if p < 2: ## [CONDITION](p < 2)=[False, False, True, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            return False
        for k in range(2, min(int(math.sqrt(p)) + 1, p - 1)):
            if p % k == 0:
                return False
        return True
    f = [0, 1]
    while True:
        f.append(f[-1] + f[-2])
        if is_prime(f[-1]): ## [CONDITION](is_prime(f[-1]))=[False, False, True, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            n -= 1
        if n == 0: ## [CONDITION](n == 0)=[False, False, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            return f[-1]
