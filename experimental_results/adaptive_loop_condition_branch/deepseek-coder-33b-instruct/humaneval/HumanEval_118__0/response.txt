[REASONING]
The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "full" ).
The length of the word is 4, which is not less than 3.
The loop starts from the third character from the end of the word and goes backwards to the second character.

Iteration 1:
    - The character 'l' is in vowels, but its neighbors 'f' and 'u' are not in vowels.
    - The condition `(word[i + 1] not in vowels) and (word[i - 1] not in vowels)` is true.
    - Action: The function returns 'l'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `get_closest_vowel("full")` is 'l'.
