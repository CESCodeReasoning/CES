The function `search` is called with ( lst = [2, 7, 8, 8, 4, 8, 7, 3, 9, 6, 5, 10, 4, 3, 6, 7, 1, 7, 4, 10, 8, 1] ).
Inside the function, a list `frq` is initialized with zeros.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 2 is encountered, so frq[2] becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 7 is encountered, so frq[7] becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 8 is encountered, so frq[8] becomes 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 8 is encountered, so frq[8] becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The number 4 is encountered, so frq[4] becomes 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The number 8 is encountered, so frq[8] becomes 3.
Iteration 7:
    -The number 7 is encountered, so frq[7] becomes 2.
Iteration 8:
    -The number 3 is encountered, so frq[3] becomes 1.
Iteration 9:
    -The number 9 is encountered, so frq[9] becomes 1.
Iteration 10:
    -The number 6 is encountered, so frq[6] becomes 1.
Iteration 11:
    -The number 5 is encountered, so frq[5] becomes 1.
Iteration 12:
    -The number 10 is encountered, so frq[10] becomes 1.
Iteration 13:
    -The number 4 is encountered, so frq[4] becomes 2.
Iteration 14:
    -The number 3 is encountered, so frq[3] becomes 2.
Iteration 15:
    -The number 6 is encountered, so frq[6] becomes 2.
Iteration 16:
    -The number 7 is encountered, so frq[7] becomes 3.
Iteration 17:
    -The number 1 is encountered, so frq[1] becomes 1.
Iteration 18:
    -The number 7 is encountered, so frq[7] becomes 4.
Iteration 19:
    -The number 4 is encountered, so frq[4] becomes 3.
Iteration 20:
    -The number 10 is encountered, so frq[10] becomes 2.
Iteration 21:
    -The number 8 is encountered, so frq[8] becomes 4.
Iteration 22:
    -The number 1 is encountered, so frq[1] becomes 2.

The loop iterates from 1 through 10 (since max(lst) = 10).
First Iteration (i = 1)
   - `frq[1]` is 2, which is not greater than or equal to 1.
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Second Iteration (i = 2)
   - `frq[2]` is 1, which is not greater than or equal to 2.
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Third Iteration (i = 3)
   - `frq[3]` is 2, which is not greater than or equal to 3.
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `frq[4]` is 3, which is not greater than or equal to 4.
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `frq[5]` is 1, which is not greater than or equal to 5.
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i`
