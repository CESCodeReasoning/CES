[REASONING]
The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input. It first removes any duplicate values from the list by converting it to a set and then back to a list. It then sorts the list in ascending order. If the length of the list is less than 2, it returns None because there is no second smallest number. Otherwise, it returns the second smallest number, which is the second element in the sorted list.

To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we first remove any duplicate values from the list. Since there are no duplicates, the list remains the same. Then, we sort the list in ascending order, which gives us [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Since the length of the list is 5, which is greater than 2, the function returns the second smallest number, which is 2.
