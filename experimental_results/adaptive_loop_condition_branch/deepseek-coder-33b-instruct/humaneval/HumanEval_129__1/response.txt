[REASONING]
The function `minPath` is called with ( grid = [[8, 14, 9, 2], [6, 4, 13, 15], [5, 7, 1, 12], [3, 10, 11, 16]], k = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `val` is initialized to `n * n + 1`.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '8' is not in vowels,so consonant_count becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'e' is in vowels, so vowel_count becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'l' is not in vowels, so consonant_count becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'l' is not in vowels, so consonant_count becomes 3.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 'o' is in vowels, so vowel_count becomes 2.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ',' is not in vowels, so consonant_count becomes 4.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not in vowels, so consonant_count becomes 5.
Iteration 8:
    -The character 'W' is not in vowels, so consonant_count becomes 6.
Iteration 9:
    -The character 'o' is in vowels, so vowel_count becomes 3.
Iteration 10:
    -The character 'r' is not in vowels, so consonant_count becomes 7.
Iteration 11:
    -The character 'l' is not in vowels, so consonant_count becomes 8.
Iteration 12:
    -The character 'd' is not in vowels, so consonant_count becomes 9.
Iteration 13:
    -The character '!' is not in vowels, so consonant_count becomes 10.

[ANSWER]
def count_vowels_consonants(input_string):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    vowel_count = 0
    consonant_count = 0
    
    for char in input_string: ## [STATE]char=['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!'][/STATE][STATE]input_string=["Hello, World!"][/STATE]
        if char in vowels: ## [CONDITION](char in vowels)=[False, True, False, False, True, False, False, False, True, False, False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, Y, N, N, Y, N, N, N, Y, N, N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            vowel_count += 1  
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y, N, Y, Y, N, Y, Y, Y, N, Y, Y, Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            consonant_count += 1 
    return (vowel_count, consonant_count)
