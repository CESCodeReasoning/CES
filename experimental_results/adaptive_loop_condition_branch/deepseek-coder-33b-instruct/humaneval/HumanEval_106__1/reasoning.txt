The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
For each iteration, if the current number i is even, calculate the factorial of i and append it to the list ret. If i is odd, calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to i and append it to the list ret.
First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, which is odd.
    - `x` is initialized to 0.
    - For each j in the inner loop, add j to `x`.
    - Append `x` to `ret`.
Second Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, which is even.
    - `x` is initialized to 1.
    - For each j in the inner loop, multiply `x` by j.
    - Append `x` to `ret`.
Third Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, which is odd.
    - `x` is initialized to 0.
    - For each j in the inner loop, add j to `x`.
    - Append `x` to `ret`.
Fourth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, which is even.
    - `x` is initialized to 1.
    - For each j in the inner loop, multiply `x` by j.
    - Append `x` to `ret`.
Fifth Iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, which is odd.
    - `x` is initialized to 0.
    - For each j in the inner loop, add j to `x`.
    - Append `x` to `ret`.
Sixth Iteration (i=6):
    - `i` is 6, which is even.
    - `x` is initialized to 1.
    - For each j in the inner loop, multiply `x` by j.
    - Append `x` to `ret`.
Seventh Iteration (i=7):
    - `i` is 7, which is odd.
    - `x` is initialized to 0.
    - For each j in the inner loop, add j to `x`.
    - Append `x` to `ret`.
