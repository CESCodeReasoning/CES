The function `total_match` is called with ( lst1 = ['4'], lst2 = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'] ).
Inside the function, two variables `l1` and `l2` are initialized to 0.
The first loop iterates over the list `lst1`. For each string `st` in `lst1`, `l1 += len(st)` updates `l1` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
The second loop iterates over the list `lst2`. For each string `st` in `lst2`, `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 5 ( 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 ).
After the loops complete, the condition ( l1 <= l2 ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `lst1` as the output.
