The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [3,2,3,100,3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None.

Iteration 1:
    - `running_max` is None, so `running_max` is set to 3.
    - `3` is appended to `result`.
Iteration 2:
    - `running_max` is not None, so `running_max` is set to the maximum of 3 and 2, which is 3.
    - `3` is appended to `result`.
Iteration 3:
    - `running_max` is not None, so `running_max` is set to the maximum of 3 and 3, which is 3.
    - `3` is appended to `result`.
Iteration 4:
    - `running_max` is not None, so `running_max` is set to the maximum of 3 and 100, which is 100.
    - `100` is appended to `result`.
Iteration 5:
    - `running_max` is not None, so `running_max` is set to the maximum of 100 and 3, which is 100.
    - `100` is appended to `result`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `rolling_max([3,2,3,100,3])` is [3, 3, 3, 100, 100].
