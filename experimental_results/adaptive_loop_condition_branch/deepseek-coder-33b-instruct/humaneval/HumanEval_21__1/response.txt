[REASONING]
The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of floating point numbers as input. It first finds the minimum and maximum numbers in the list. Then it rescales each number in the list by subtracting the minimum number and dividing by the range of the numbers (maximum - minimum). The rescaled numbers are returned as a new list.

To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0], we first find the minimum and maximum numbers in the list, which are 1.0 and 5.0, respectively. Then we rescale each number in the list by subtracting the minimum number and dividing by the range of the numbers (5.0 - 1.0 = 4.0). The rescaled numbers are [(2.0 - 1.0) / 4.0, (1.0 - 1.0) / 4.0, (5.0 - 1.0) / 4.0, (3.0 - 1.0) / 4.0, (4.0 - 1.0) / 4.0] = [1.0, 0.0, 4.0/4.0, 2.0/4.0, 3.0/4.0] = [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75].
