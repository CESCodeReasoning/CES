The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with ( paren_string = '(()(())((())))' ).
Inside the function, two variables `result` and `current_string` are initialized to empty lists. A variable `current_depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 2 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 2 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -The condition `current_depth == 0` is true, so `current_string` is joined into a string and appended to `result`.
    -`current_string` is cleared.
Iteration 7:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 8:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 2 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 9:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 10:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -The condition `current_depth == 0` is true, so `current_string` is joined into a string and appended to `result`.
    -`current_string` is cleared.
Iteration 11:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 12:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -The condition `current_depth == 0` is true, so `current_string` is joined into a string and appended to `result`.
    -`current_string` is cleared.
Iteration 13:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -The condition `current_depth == 0` is true, so `current_string` is joined into a string and appended to `result`.
    -`current_string` is cleared.

Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `result`, which is now ['()', '(())', '((()))'].
