The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "yogurt" ).
The length of the word is 6, which is not less than 3.
The loop starts from the third last character of the word (index `len(word) - 2`) and goes backwards to the second character (index `1`).

Iteration 1:
    - The character 'r' is not a vowel.
Iteration 2:
    - The character 't' is not a vowel.
Iteration 3:
    - The character 'u' is a vowel.
    - The characters before and after 'u' are not vowels.
    - So, 'u' is returned as the closest vowel.
