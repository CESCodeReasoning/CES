[REASONING]
The function `exchange` is called with ( lst1 = [1, 2, 3, 4] and lst2 = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is odd, so odd becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 2 is even, so even becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 3 is odd, so odd becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 4 is even, so even becomes 2.

The condition `even >= odd` is false (2 >= 2 is false), so the function returns "NO".

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    odd = 0
    even = 0
    for i in lst1: ## [STATE]i=[1, 2, 3, 4][/STATE][STATE]lst1=[[1, 2, 3, 4]][/STATE]
        if i%2 == 1: ## [CONDITION](i%2 == 1)=[True, False, True, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, N, Y, N][/BRANCH]
            odd += 1
    for i in lst2: ## [STATE]i=[1, 2, 3, 4][/STATE][STATE]lst2=[[1, 2, 3, 4]][/STATE]
        if i%2 == 0: ## [CONDITION](i%2 == 0)=[False, True, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, Y, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            even += 1
    if even >= odd: ## [CONDITION](even >= odd)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return "YES"
    return "NO"
