The function `is_happy` is called with ( s = "xyy" ).
The length of the string "xyy" is 3, which is not less than 3.
The loop iterates from 0 through 1 (since ( len(s) - 2 ) is 1).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `s[i]` is 'x', `s[i + 1]` is 'y', and `s[i + 2]` is 'y'.
   - The condition `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `s[i]` is 'y', `s[i + 1]` is 'y', and `s[i + 2]` is 'y'.
   - The condition `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` is executed, so the function returns False.
Therefore, the final output of the function `is_happy("xyy")` is False.
