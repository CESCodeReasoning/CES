The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [1,2,3] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `result` is initialized.
The loop iterates from 0 through 2 (since len(lst) = 3).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( i % 3 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` results in `result = [1]`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which does not satisfy ( i % 3 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 4 == 0 and i%3 != 0` is false.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i])` updates `result` to `[1, 2]`.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which satisfies ( i % 3 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` updates `result` to `[1, 2, 9]`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the sum of the elements in `result`, which is 12.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_squares([1,2,3])` is 12.
