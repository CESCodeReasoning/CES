The function next_smallest takes a list lst as input. It first removes any duplicate values in the list by converting the list to a set and then back to a list. It then sorts the list in ascending order. If the length of the list is less than 2, it means there are less than 2 unique elements in the list, so it returns None. Otherwise, it returns the second element in the sorted list, which is the next smallest element after the smallest element.

To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [], we first remove any duplicate values in the list. Since there are no elements in the list, there are no duplicates to remove. Then, we sort the list. Since there are no elements in the list, the sorted list is also empty. Since the length of the list is less than 2, the function returns None.
