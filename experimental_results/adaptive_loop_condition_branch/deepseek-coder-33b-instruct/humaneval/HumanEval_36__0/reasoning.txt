The function `fizz_buzz` is called with ( n = 100000 ).
Inside the function, an empty list `ns` is initialized.
The loop iterates from 0 through 99999 (since ( n = 100000 )).
For each iteration, the number `i` is checked if it is divisible by 11 or 13.
   - If `i` is divisible by 11 or 13, `i` is appended to the list `ns`.
After the loop, all numbers in `ns` are converted to strings and joined into a single string `s`.
Then, for each character `c` in the string `s`, if `c` is '7', `ans` is incremented by 1.
Finally, the function returns the value of `ans`.
