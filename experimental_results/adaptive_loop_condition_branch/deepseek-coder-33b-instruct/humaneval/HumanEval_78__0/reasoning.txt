The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "2020" ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the characters in the string `num`.
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `num[i]` is '2', which is in the tuple `primes`.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` results in `total = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `num[i]` is '0', which is not in the tuple `primes`.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `num[i]` is '2', which is in the tuple `primes`.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `num[i]` is '0', which is not in the tuple `primes`.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `total`, which is now 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `hex_key("2020")` is 2.
