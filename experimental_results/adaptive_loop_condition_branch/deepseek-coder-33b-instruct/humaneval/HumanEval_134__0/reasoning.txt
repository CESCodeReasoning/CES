The function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter takes a string txt as input. It splits the string into a list of words using the split(' ') method. The last word in the list is then accessed using the index -1.

The function then checks if the length of the last word is 1 (i.e., it's a single character) and if the ASCII value of the lowercase version of the last character is between 97 and 122 (inclusive), which are the ASCII values for lowercase letters.

The ASCII values for lowercase letters are 97 to 122. If the last character of the last word is a lowercase letter, the ASCII value of the character will be between 97 and 122. Therefore, the function returns True.

If the last word is not a single character or if the last character is not a lowercase letter, the function returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter on the input "apple pi e ", the last word is "e". The length of "e" is 1 and it's a lowercase letter. Therefore, the output of executing the function on the input "apple pi e " is True.
