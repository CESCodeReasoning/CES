[REASONING]
The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 3, b = 7 ).
Inside the function, a while loop is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers.
First Iteration:
    - b = 7, a % b = 3.
    - `a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 7 and `b` to 3.
Second Iteration:
    - b = 3, a % b = 1.
    - `a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 3 and `b` to 1.
Third Iteration:
    - b = 1, a % b = 0.
    - `a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 1 and `b` to 0.
b is now 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 1.

def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    while b: ## [STATE]b=[7, 3, 1, 0][/STATE]
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
