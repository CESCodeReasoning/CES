[REASONING]
The function `get_odd_collatz` is called with ( n = 1 ).
The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false, so the else branch is taken. `odd_collatz` is initialized with a list containing only `n`.
The loop iterates as long as `n` is greater than 1.
First Iteration (n = 1):
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The else branch is taken. `odd_collatz` is initialized with a list containing only `n`.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. So, `n = n * 3 + 1` is executed. `n` becomes 4.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is true. `n` is appended to `odd_collatz`.
Second Iteration (n = 4):
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. So, `n = n / 2` is executed. `n` becomes 2.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is false. So, `n` is not appended to `odd_collatz`.
Third Iteration (n = 2):
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. So, `n = n / 2` is executed. `n` becomes 1.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is false. So, `n` is not appended to `odd_collatz`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the sorted list `odd_collatz`, which is now [1].

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def get_odd_collatz(n):
    if n % 2 == 0: ## [CONDITION](n % 2 == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        odd_collatz = []
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        odd_collatz = [n]
    while n > 1: ## [STATE](n > 1)=[True, True, True, False][/STATE][STATE]n=[1, 4, 2, 1][/STATE]
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n / 2
        else:
            n = n * 3 + 1

        if n % 2 == 1:
            odd_collatz.append(int(n))

    return sorted(odd_collatz)
