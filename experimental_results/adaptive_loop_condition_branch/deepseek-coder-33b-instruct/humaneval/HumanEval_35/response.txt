[REASONING]
The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list, which is 1.

Iteration 1:
    -The element 1 is not greater than 1, so `m` remains 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 2 is greater than 1, so `m` becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The element 3 is not greater than 2, so `m` remains 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `max_element([1, 2, 3])` is 2.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def max_element(l: list):
    m = l[0]
    for e in l: ## [STATE]e=[1, 2, 3][/STATE][STATE]l=[[1, 2, 3]][/STATE]
        if e > m: ## [CONDITION](e > m)=[False, True, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, Y, N][/BRANCH]
            m = e
    return m
