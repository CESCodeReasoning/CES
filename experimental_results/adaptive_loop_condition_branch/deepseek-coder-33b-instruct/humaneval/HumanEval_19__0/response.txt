[REASONING]
The function sort_numbers takes a string of numbers as input, where each number is represented as a word (e.g., 'one', 'two', 'three', etc.). It then splits this string into a list of words, maps each word to its corresponding integer value using the value_map dictionary, and sorts the list of integers. Finally, it joins the sorted list of integers back into a string, with each integer separated by a space.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_numbers on the input '', we need to split the input string into a list of words, map each word to its corresponding integer value, and sort the list of integers. However, since the input string is empty, the list of words is also empty. Therefore, the sorted list of integers is also empty. Finally, the output of executing the function sort_numbers on the input '' is ''.
