[REASONING]
The function string_to_md5 takes a string text as input. It first checks if the text is not empty. If it is not empty, it encodes the text into ASCII format, computes the MD5 hash of the encoded text, and returns the hexadecimal representation of the hash. If the text is empty, it returns None.

To determine the output of executing the function string_to_md5 on the input '', we need to follow the steps above. Since the input is an empty string, the function returns None.
