The function `move_one_ball` is called with ( arr = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] ).

First, it checks if the length of the array is 0. In this case, it is not, so it proceeds to the next step.

Next, it sorts the array and creates a new array `my_arr` by rotating the original array so that the smallest element is at the start.

Then, it iterates over the elements of `my_arr` and `sorted_array`. If any element in `my_arr` is not equal to the corresponding element in `sorted_array`, it returns `False`.

In this case, all elements in `my_arr` are equal to the corresponding elements in `sorted_array`, so it returns `True`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])` is `True`.
