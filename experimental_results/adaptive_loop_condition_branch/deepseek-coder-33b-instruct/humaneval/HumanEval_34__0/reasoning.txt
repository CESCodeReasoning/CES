The function unique takes a list l as input. It first converts the list to a set to remove any duplicate elements, then converts the set back to a list and sorts it. The sorted list is then returned.

To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input ['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd'], we first convert the list to a set to remove any duplicate elements. The set will only contain unique elements, so the set will be {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}.

Next, we convert the set back to a list. Since sets are unordered in Python, the list might not be in the same order as the original list.

Finally, we sort the list in ascending order. The sorted list is then returned.

Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input ['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd'] is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].
