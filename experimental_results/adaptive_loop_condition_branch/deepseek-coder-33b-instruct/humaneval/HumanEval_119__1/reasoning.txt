Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is in S1, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 2:

Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is in S1, so val becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is not in S1, so val becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ')' is not in S1, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ')' is not in S1, so val becomes 0.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ')' is not in S1, so val becomes -1.
Iteration 8:
    -The character '(' is in S1, so val becomes 0.
Iteration 9:
    -The character ')' is not in S1, so val becomes -1.
Iteration 10:
    -The character ')' is not in S1, so val becomes -2.
Iteration 11:
    -The character ')' is not in S1, so val becomes -3.
Iteration 12:
    -The character ')' is not in S1, so val becomes -4.
