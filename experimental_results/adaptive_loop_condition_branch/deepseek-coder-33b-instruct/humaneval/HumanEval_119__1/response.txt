[REASONING]
The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['(()(())', '())())'] ).

The function `check` is defined inside `match_parens`. It takes a string `s` as input and checks if the parentheses in `s` are balanced.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is in S1, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is in S1, so val becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is in S1, so val becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is not in S1, so val becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ')' is not in S1, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ')' is not in S1, so val becomes 0.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ')' is not in S1, so val becomes -1.
Iteration 8:
    -The character '(' is in S1, so val becomes 0.
Iteration 9:
    -The character ')' is not in S1, so val becomes -1.
Iteration 10:
    -The character ')' is not in S1, so val becomes -2.
Iteration 11:
    -The character ')' is not in S1, so val becomes -3.
Iteration 12:
    -The character ')' is not in S1, so val becomes -4.

        for i in s: ## [STATE]i=['(', '(', '(', ')', ')', ')', ')', '(', ')', ')', ')'][/STATE][STATE]s=["(()(())", "())())"]

                return False
        return True if val == 0 else False

    S1 = lst[0] + lst[1]
    S2 = lst[1] + lst[0]
    return 'Yes' if check(S1) or check(S2) else 'No'
