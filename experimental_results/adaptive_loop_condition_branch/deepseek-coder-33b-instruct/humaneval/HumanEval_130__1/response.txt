The function `tri` is called with ( n = 8 ).

First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which satisfies ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` results in `my_tri = [1, 3, 2]`.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which does not satisfy ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` results in `my_tri = [1, 3, 2, 6]`.
Third Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which satisfies ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` results in `my_tri = [1, 3, 2, 6, 3]`.
Fourth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which does not satisfy ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` results in `my_tri = [1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 11]`.
Fifth Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is 6, which satisfies ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` results in `my_tri = [1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 11, 4]`.
Sixth Iteration (i = 7)
   - `i` is 7, which does not satisfy ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` results in `my_tri = [1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 11, 4, 18]`.
Seventh Iteration (i = 8)
   - `i` is 8, which satisfies ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` results in `my_tri = [1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 11, 4, 18, 5]`.
Eighth Iteration (i = 9)
   - `i` is 9, which does not satisfy ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` results in `my_tri = [1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 11, 4, 18, 5, 28]`.

Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `my_tri`, which is now [1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 11, 4, 18, 5, 28].

Therefore, the final output of the function `tri(8)` is [1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 11, 4, 18, 5, 28].
