The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 3 (since ( len(arr) // 2 ) is 3).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, so `arr[i]` is 1 and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 2.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` results in `ans = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, so `arr[i]` is 2 and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 2.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, so `arr[i]` is 3 and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 2.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` updates `ans` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, but since 3 is not less than 3 (len(arr) // 2), the loop ends.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is now 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2])` is 2.
