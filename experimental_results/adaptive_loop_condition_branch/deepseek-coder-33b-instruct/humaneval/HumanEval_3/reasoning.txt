The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -3, 1, 2, -3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The operation 1 is added to balance, so balance becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The operation 2 is added to balance, so balance becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The operation -3 is added to balance, so balance becomes 0.
Iteration 4:
    -The operation 1 is added to balance, so balance becomes 1.
Iteration 5:
    -The operation 2 is added to balance, so balance becomes 3.
Iteration 6:
    -The operation -3 is added to balance, so balance becomes 0.

The balance never goes below zero, so the function returns False.
