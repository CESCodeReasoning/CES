[REASONING]
The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -3, 1, 2, -3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The operation 1 is added to balance, so balance becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The operation 2 is added to balance, so balance becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The operation -3 is added to balance, so balance becomes 0.
Iteration 4:
    -The operation 1 is added to balance, so balance becomes 1.
Iteration 5:
    -The operation 2 is added to balance, so balance becomes 3.
Iteration 6:
    -The operation -3 is added to balance, so balance becomes 0.

The balance never goes below zero, so the function returns False.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0

    for op in operations: ## [STATE]op=[1, 2, -3, 1, 2, -3][/STATE][STATE]operations=[[1, 2, -3, 1, 2, -3]][/STATE]
        balance += op
        if balance < 0: ## [CONDITION](balance < 0)=[False, False, True, False, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            return True

    return False
