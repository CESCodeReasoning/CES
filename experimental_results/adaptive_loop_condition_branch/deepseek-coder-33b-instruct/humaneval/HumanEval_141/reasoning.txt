The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = "example.txt" ).
The file name is split into two parts by the '.' separator.
The length of the resulting list is 2, so the first condition `len(lst) != 2` is not true.
The second part of the file name is "txt", which is in the list of valid suffixes ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'], so the second condition `not lst[1] in suf` is not true.
The first part of the file name is "example", which is not empty, so the third condition `len(lst[0]) == 0` is not true.
The first character of the first part of the file name is "e", which is an alphabet, so the fourth condition `not lst[0][0].isalpha()` is not true.
The number of digits in the first part of the file name is 0, which is not more than 3, so the fifth condition `t > 3` is not true.
Therefore, all conditions are true, and the function returns 'Yes'.
