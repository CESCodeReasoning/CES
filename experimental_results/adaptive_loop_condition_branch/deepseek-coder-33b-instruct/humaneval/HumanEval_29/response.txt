[REASONING]
The function filter_by_prefix takes a list of strings and a prefix as input. It returns a new list that contains only the strings from the input list that start with the given prefix.

In the given input, the list is empty and the prefix is 'john'. Since there are no strings in the list, the function will return an empty list.
