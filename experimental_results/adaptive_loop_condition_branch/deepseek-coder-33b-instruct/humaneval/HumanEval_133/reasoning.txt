The function `sum_squares` is called with (lst = [1,2,3]).
Inside the function, a variable `squared` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`.
First Iteration (i = 1):
    `math.ceil(i)**2` results in 1**2 = 1.
    This is then added to `squared`, updating `squared` to 1.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    `math.ceil(i)**2` results in 2**2 = 4.
    This is then added to `squared`, updating `squared` to 5.
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    `math.ceil(i)**2` results in 3**2 = 9.
    This is then added to `squared`, updating `squared` to 14.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `squared`, which is now 14.
