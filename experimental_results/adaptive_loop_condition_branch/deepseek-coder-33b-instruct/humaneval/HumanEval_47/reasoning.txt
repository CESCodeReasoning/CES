The function `median` is called with ( l = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5] ).
The list `l` is sorted to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The length of the list `l` is 5, which is odd.
The condition `len(l) % 2 == 1` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns the middle element of the list, which is 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])` is 3.
