The function `eat` is called with ( number = 2, need = 11, remaining = 5 ).
`need` is 11, which is greater than `remaining` which is 5.
The condition `need <= remaining` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
The `else` block's action: `return [number + remaining, 0]` returns `[2 + 5, 0]` which is `[7, 0]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `eat(2, 11, 5)` is `[7, 0]`.
