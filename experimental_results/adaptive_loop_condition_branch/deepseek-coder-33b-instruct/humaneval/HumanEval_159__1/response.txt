[REASONING]
The function `eat` is called with ( number = 2, need = 11, remaining = 5 ).
`need` is 11, which is greater than `remaining` which is 5.
The condition `need <= remaining` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
The `else` block's action: `return [number + remaining, 0]` returns `[2 + 5, 0]` which is `[7, 0]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `eat(2, 11, 5)` is `[7, 0]`.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def eat(number, need, remaining):
    if (need <= remaining): ## [CONDITION](need <= remaining)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return [number + need, remaining - need]
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return [number + remaining, 0]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[7, 0]
[/OUTPUT]
