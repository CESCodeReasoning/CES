[REASONING]
The function `is_prime` is called with ( n = 6 ).

First Condition:
    - `n` is 6, which is not less than 2.
    - The condition `n < 2` is false.
    - Action: The loop is not executed.

Second Iteration (k = 2)
    - `n` is 6, which is divisible by 2.
    - The condition `n % k == 0` is true.
    - Action: The function returns `False`.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2: ## [CONDITION](n < 2)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return False
    for k in range(2, n - 1): ## [STATE]k=[2][/STATE][STATE]range(2, (n - 1))=[2, 3, 4, 5][/STATE][STATE](n - 1)=[5][/STATE]
        if n % k == 0: ## [CONDITION](n % k == 0)=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
            return False
    return True
