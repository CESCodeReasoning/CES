The function triangle_area takes two parameters: a and h. It calculates the area of a triangle using the formula: area = (base * height) / 2.

Given a = 2 and h = 2, we substitute these values into the formula.

The calculation is: (2 * 2) / 2.0 = 2.0

Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (2, 2) is 2.0.
