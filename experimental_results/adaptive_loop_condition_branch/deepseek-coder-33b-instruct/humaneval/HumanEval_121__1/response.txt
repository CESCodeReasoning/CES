[REASONING]
The function solution takes a list of integers as input. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list, keeping only the elements at even indices (where the index is even) and where the element is odd. It then sums up these elements and returns the result.

To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32], we need to find the elements at even indices in the list that are also odd. In this case, the elements at even indices are 30 and 23. However, only 30 is odd, so the sum is 30.
