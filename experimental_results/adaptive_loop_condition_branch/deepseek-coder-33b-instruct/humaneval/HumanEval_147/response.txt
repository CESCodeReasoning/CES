[REASONING]
The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list A to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4.
    - A[i]=1: compare with 4, 9, 16, 25:
        - When j = 1 (A[j]=4), k in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4.
            - When k = 2 (A[k]=9), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
            - When k = 3 (A[k]=16), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
            - When k = 4 (A[k]=25), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (A[j]=9), k in the inner loop is 3, 4.
            - When k = 3 (A[k]=16), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
            - When k = 4 (A[k]=25), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (A[j]=16), k in the inner loop is 4.
            - When k = 4 (A[k]=25), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4.
    - A[i]=4: compare with 9, 16, 25:
        - When j = 2 (A[j]=9), k in the inner loop is 3, 4.
            - When k = 3 (A[k]=16), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
            - When k = 4 (A[k]=25), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (A[j]=16), k in the inner loop is 4.
            - When k = 4 (A[k]=25), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4.
    - A[i]=9: compare with 16, 25:
        - When j = 3 (A[j]=16), k in the inner loop is 4.
            - When k = 4 (A[k]=25), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4.
    - A[i]=16: compare with 25:
        - When j = 4 (A[j]=25), k in the inner loop is 4.
            - When k = 4 (A[k]=25), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
