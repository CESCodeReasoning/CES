The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1 ).
`k` is 1, which is not equal to 0.
The condition `k == 0` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
Action: `arr.sort()` sorts the array in ascending order.
Action: `ans = arr[-k:]` takes the last `k` elements from the sorted array.
Return Statement
   - After the if-else block, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is the last element of the sorted array.

Therefore, the final output of the function `maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1)` is [1].
