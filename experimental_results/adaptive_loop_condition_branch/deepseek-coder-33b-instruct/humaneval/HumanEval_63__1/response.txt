[REASONING]
The function `fibfib` is called with ( n = 10 ).
`n` is 10, which does not satisfy any of the conditions (n == 0, n == 1, n == 2).
Therefore, none of the if branches are taken.
The function then recursively calls itself with (n - 1), (n - 2), and (n - 3) as arguments.

The recursive calls are:
1. fibfib(9)
2. fibfib(8)
3. fibfib(7)

Each of these calls will again make recursive calls until the base cases are reached.

The final output of the function `fibfib(10)` is the sum of the outputs of the recursive calls.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def fibfib(n: int):
    if n == 0: ## [CONDITION](n == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return 0
    if n == 1: ## [CONDITION](n == 1)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return 0
    if n == 2: ## [CONDITION](n == 2)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return 1
    return fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
The output of fibfib(10) will be the sum of the outputs of the recursive calls.
