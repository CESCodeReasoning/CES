The function `intersperse` is called with ( numbers = [5, 6, 3, 2], delimeter = 8 ).
The condition (not numbers) is not satisfied, therefore the else branch is taken.
The loop iterates over the list `numbers` excluding the last element.
First Iteration (n = 5):
    n is appended to `result`, then `delimeter` is appended to `result`.
Second Iteration (n = 6):
    n is appended to `result`, then `delimeter` is appended to `result`.
Third Iteration (n = 3):
    n is appended to `result`, then `delimeter` is appended to `result`.
Finally, the last element of `numbers` (2) is appended to `result`.
The function returns `result` as the output.
