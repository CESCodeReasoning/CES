def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    if not numbers: ## [CONDITION](not numbers)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return []

    result = []

    for n in numbers[:-1]: ## [STATE]n=[5, 6, 3][/STATE][STATE]numbers[:(- 1)]=[5, 6, 3, 2][/STATE]
        result.append(n)
        result.append(delimeter)

    result.append(numbers[-1])

    return result
[/ANSWER]

[REASONING]
The function `intersperse` is called with ( numbers = [5, 6, 3, 2], delimeter = 8 ).
The condition (not numbers) is not satisfied, therefore the else branch is taken.
The loop iterates over the list `numbers` excluding the last element.
First Iteration (n = 5):
    n is appended to `result`, then `delimeter` is appended to `result`.
Second Iteration (n = 6):
    n is appended to `result`, then `delimeter` is appended to `result`.
Third Iteration (n = 3):
    n is appended to `result`, then `delimeter` is appended to `result`.
Finally, the last element of `numbers` (2) is appended to `result`.
The function returns `result` as the output.
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[5, 8, 6, 8, 3, 8, 2]
[/OUTPUT]
