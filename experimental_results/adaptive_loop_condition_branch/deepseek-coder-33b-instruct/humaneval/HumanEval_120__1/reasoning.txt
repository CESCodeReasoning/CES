The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [123, -123, 20, 0 , 1, 2, -3], k = 3 ).
`k` is 3, which is not equal to 0.
The condition `k == 0` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
Action: `arr.sort()` sorts the array in ascending order.
Action: `ans = arr[-k:]` takes the last `k` elements from the sorted array.
Return Statement
   - After the if-else block, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is [0, 1, 2].

Therefore, the final output of the function `maximum([123, -123, 20, 0 , 1, 2, -3], 3)` is [0, 1, 2].
