[REASONING]
The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "<<<><>>>>" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '<' is equal to "<", so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '<' is equal to "<", so depth becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '<' is equal to "<", so depth becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes 0.
Iteration 7:
    -The character '<' is equal to "<", so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 8:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes 0.
Iteration 9:
    -The character '>' is not equal to "<", so depth becomes -1.

At this point, depth is -1, which is less than 0, so the function returns False.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets: ## [STATE]b=['<', '<', '<', '>', '>', '>', '<', '>', '>'][/STATE][STATE]brackets=["<<<><>>>>"][/STATE]
        if b == "<": ## [CONDITION](b == "<")=[True, True, True, False, False, False, True, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y, Y, N, N, N, Y, N, N][/BRANCH]
            depth += 1
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, Y, Y, Y, N, Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0: ## [CONDITION](depth < 0)=[False, False, False, False, False, False, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N, N, N, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            return False
    return depth == 0
