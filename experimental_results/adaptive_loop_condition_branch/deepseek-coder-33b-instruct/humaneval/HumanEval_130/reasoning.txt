The function `tri` is called with ( n = 3 ).

First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which satisfies ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` results in `my_tri = [1, 3, 2]`.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which does not satisfy ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` results in `my_tri = [1, 3, 2, 6]`.

Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `my_tri`, which is now [1, 3, 2, 6].

Therefore, the final output of the function `tri(3)` is [1, 3, 2, 6].
