The function `is_multiply_prime` checks if a number `a` can be expressed as the product of three prime numbers.

The helper function `is_prime` checks if a number `n` is prime. It does this by checking if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to `n-1`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime and the function returns `False`. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime and the function returns `True`.

The main function `is_multiply_prime` checks if `a` can be expressed as the product of three prime numbers. It does this by checking all possible combinations of three prime numbers. If it finds a combination that multiplies to `a`, it returns `True`. If it checks all combinations and does not find a match, it returns `False`.

The prime numbers between 2 and 100 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.

The number `a` is `3 * 6 * 7`, which is 126.

The combinations of three prime numbers that multiply to 126 are:
- 2 * 6 * 73
- 3 * 4 * 11
- 5 * 2 * 7
- 7 * 2 * 3

None of these combinations match 126, so the function returns `False`.
