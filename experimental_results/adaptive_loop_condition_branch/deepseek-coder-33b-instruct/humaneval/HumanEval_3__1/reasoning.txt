The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, -1, 2, -2, 5, -5, 4, -4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The operation 1 is added to balance, so balance becomes 1.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is false.
Iteration 2:
    -The operation -1 is added to balance, so balance becomes 0.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is false.
Iteration 3:
    -The operation 2 is added to balance, so balance becomes 2.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is false.
Iteration 4:
    -The operation -2 is added to balance, so balance becomes 0.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is false.
Iteration 5:
    -The operation 5 is added to balance, so balance becomes 5.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is false.
Iteration 6:
    -The operation -5 is added to balance, so balance becomes 0.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is false.
Iteration 7:
    -The operation 4 is added to balance, so balance becomes 4.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is false.
Iteration 8:
    -The operation -4 is added to balance, so balance becomes 0.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is false.

The function `below_zero` returns False, as no balance was ever less than 0.
