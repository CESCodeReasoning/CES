[REASONING]
The function `sum_squares` is called with (lst = [1,3,5,7]).
Inside the function, a variable `squared` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`.
First Iteration (i = 1):
    `math.ceil(i)**2` results in 1**2 = 1, which is then added to `squared`.
Second Iteration (i = 3):
    `math.ceil(i)**2` results in 3**2 = 9, which is then added to `squared`.
Third Iteration (i = 5):
    `math.ceil(i)**2` results in 5**2 = 25, which is then added to `squared`.
Fourth Iteration (i = 7):
    `math.ceil(i)**2` results in 7**2 = 49, which is then added to `squared`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `squared`, which is now 84.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def sum_squares(lst):
    import math
    squared = 0
    for i in lst: ## [STATE]i=[1, 3, 5, 7][/STATE][STATE]lst=[[1, 3, 5, 7]][/STATE]
        squared += math.ceil(i)**2
    return squared
