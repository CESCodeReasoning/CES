[REASONING]
The function incr_list takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1.
To determine the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [3, 2, 1], we need to increment each element of the list by 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [3, 2, 1] is [4, 3, 2].
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[4, 3, 2]
