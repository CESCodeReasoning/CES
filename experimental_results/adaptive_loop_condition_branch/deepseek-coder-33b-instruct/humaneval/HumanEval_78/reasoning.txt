The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "AB" ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 2 (since ( len(num) = 2 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `num[i]` is 'A', which is not in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - Action: `total += 1` is not executed.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `num[i]` is 'B', which is not in primes.
   - The same condition is false.
   - Action: `total += 1` is not executed.

Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `total`, which is still 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `hex_key("AB")` is 0.
