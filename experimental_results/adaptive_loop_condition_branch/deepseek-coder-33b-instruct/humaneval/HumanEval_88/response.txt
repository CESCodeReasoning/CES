[REASONING]
The function sort_array takes an array as input. It first checks if the length of the array is 0. If it is, it returns an empty array. If not, it sorts the array in descending order if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, and in ascending order if it is odd.

In the given array [15, 42, 87, 32 ,11, 0], the sum of the first and last elements is 15, which is odd. Therefore, the array is sorted in ascending order.

The sorted array is [0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87].
