[REASONING]
The function `is_multiply_prime` checks if a number `a` can be expressed as the product of three prime numbers.

The helper function `is_prime` checks if a number `n` is prime. It does this by checking if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to `n-1`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime and the function returns `False`. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime and the function returns `True`.

The main function `is_multiply_prime` checks if `a` can be expressed as the product of three prime numbers. It does this by checking all possible combinations of three prime numbers. If it finds a combination that multiplies to `a`, it returns `True`. If it checks all combinations and does not find a match, it returns `False`.

The prime numbers between 2 and 100 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.

The function `is_multiply_prime(125)` checks if 125 can be expressed as the product of three prime numbers. It does this by checking all possible combinations of three prime numbers.

The first combination it checks is 2 * 3 * 5 = 30. Since 30 is not equal to 125, the function continues to the next combination.

The next combination it checks is 2 * 3 * 7 = 42. Since 42 is not equal to 125, the function continues to the next combination.

This process continues until it checks the combination 7 * 11 * 13 = 1001. Since 1001 is not equal to 125, the function continues to the next combination.

The function checks all possible combinations and does not find a match, so it returns `False`.

Therefore, the function `is_multiply_prime(125)` returns `False`.
