The function `split_words` is called with ( txt = "" ).
The condition `" " in txt` is False, so the first branch is not taken.
The condition `"," in txt` is also False, so the second branch is not taken.
The `else` branch is taken.
In the `else` branch, the function returns the length of a list comprehension.
The list comprehension iterates over each character in `txt`, and includes the character in the list if it is a lowercase letter and its ASCII value is even.
Since `txt` is an empty string, the list comprehension returns an empty list, and `len([])` returns 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `split_words("")` is 0.
