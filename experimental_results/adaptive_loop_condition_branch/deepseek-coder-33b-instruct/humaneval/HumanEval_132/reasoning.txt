The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = '[[]]' ).
Inside the function, two empty lists `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` are initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '[' is an opening bracket, so it's index (0) is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '[' is an opening bracket, so it's index (1) is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ']' is a closing bracket, so it's index (2) is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ']' is a closing bracket, so it's index (3) is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.

After the loop, `closing_bracket_index` is reversed to [3, 2].

Then, a counter `cnt` is initialized to 0 and an index `i` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The index (0) from `opening_bracket_index` is less than the length of `closing_bracket_index` (2) and less than the index (3) from `closing_bracket_index`.
    -The condition is true, so `cnt` becomes 1 and `i` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The index (1) from `opening_bracket_index` is less than the length of `closing_bracket_index` (2) and less than the index (2) from `closing_bracket_index`.
    -The condition is true, so `cnt` becomes 2 and `i` becomes 2.

Finally, the function returns `cnt >= 2`, which is true (2 >= 2).
