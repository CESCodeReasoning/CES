The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "5/1", n = "3/1" ).
The function splits the input strings into numerators and denominators.
The numerator and denominator are then multiplied together.
The condition `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` is checked.
Here, `numerator` is 5 * 3 = 15 and `denom` is 1 * 1 = 1.
15 / 1 = 15.0, which is not equal to 15 when converted to an integer.
Therefore, the condition is false and the else branch is taken.

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("5/1", "3/1")` is False.
