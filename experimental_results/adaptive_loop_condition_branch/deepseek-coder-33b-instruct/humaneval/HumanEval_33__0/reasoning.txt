The function sort_third takes a list l as input. It first makes a copy of the list to avoid modifying the original list. Then it sorts every third element in the list. The sorted list is then returned.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], we need to sort every third element in the list.

The third, sixth, and ninth elements in the list are -5, 3, and 0. After sorting these elements, the list becomes [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 0, 9, 123, 1, -10].

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] is [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 0, 9, 123, 1, -10].
