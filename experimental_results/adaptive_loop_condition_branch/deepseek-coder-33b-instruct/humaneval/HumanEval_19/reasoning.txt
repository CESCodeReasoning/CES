The function sort_numbers takes a string of numbers as input, where the numbers are represented as words. It then maps these words to their corresponding numerical values using the value_map dictionary. The function then splits the input string into a list of words, sorts this list based on the numerical values of the words, and joins the sorted list back into a string.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_numbers on the input 'five zero four seven nine eight', we first map the words to their numerical values:

'five' -> 5
'zero' -> 0
'four' -> 4
'seven' -> 7
'nine' -> 9
'eight' -> 8

Then we sort the list of numbers based on their numerical values:

[0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]

Finally, we join the sorted list back into a string:

'zero four five seven eight nine'

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_numbers on the input 'five zero four seven nine eight' is 'zero four five seven eight nine'.
