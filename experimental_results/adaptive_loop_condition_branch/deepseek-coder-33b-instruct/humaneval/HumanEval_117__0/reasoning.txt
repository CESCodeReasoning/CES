The function select_words(s, n) takes a string s and an integer n as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each word in the string s.
For each word, it counts the number of consonants in the word.
If the number of consonants equals to n, it appends the word to the result list.
First Iteration (word="Hello"):
    - `word` is "Hello", i in the inner loop is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
    - `n_consonants` is 3, because "H", "l", "l" are consonants.
    - `n_consonants` is not equal to `n`, so the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (word="world"):
    - `word` is "world", i in the inner loop is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
    - `n_consonants` is 3, because "w", "r", "l" are consonants.
    - `n_consonants` is not equal to `n`, so the if branch is not taken.
