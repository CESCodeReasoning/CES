The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3 ).
`k` is 3, which is not equal to 0.
The condition `k == 0` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
Action: `arr.sort()` sorts the array in ascending order, resulting in `arr = [-4, -3, 5]`.
Action: `ans = arr[-k:]` takes the last `k` elements from the sorted array, resulting in `ans = [5]`.
Return Statement
   - After the if-else block, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is now [5].

Therefore, the final output of the function `maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3)` is [5].
