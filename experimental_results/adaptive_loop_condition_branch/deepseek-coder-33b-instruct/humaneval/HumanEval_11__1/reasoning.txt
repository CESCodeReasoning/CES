The function `string_xor` is called with ( a = '0101', b = '0000' ).
The function `xor` is defined inside `string_xor`. It takes two arguments `i` and `j` and returns '0' if `i` and `j` are equal and '1' otherwise.
The `xor` function is used in a generator expression inside the `join` method. The `zip` function is used to pair the characters of `a` and `b`. For each pair, `xor` is called with the pair of characters.

First Pair (x = '0', y = '0')
   - `x` and `y` are equal, so the condition `x == y` is true.
   - The condition `x == y` is true.
   - Action: `xor(x, y)` returns '0'.
Second Pair (x = '1', y = '0')
   - `x` and `y` are not equal, so the condition `x == y` is false.
   - The condition `x == y` is false.
   - Action: `xor(x, y)` returns '1'.
Third Pair (x = '0', y = '0')
   - `x` and `y` are equal, so the condition `x == y` is true.
   - The condition `x == y` is true.
   - Action: `xor(x, y)` returns '0'.
Fourth Pair (x = '1', y = '0')
   - `x` and `y` are not equal, so the condition `x == y` is false.
   - The condition `x == y` is false.
   - Action: `xor(x, y)` returns '1'.

The `join` method concatenates all the '0's and '1's returned by `xor` into a single string.

Therefore, the final output of the function `string_xor('0101', '0000')` is '0101'.
