The function `find_zero` is called with ( xs = [5, 3, -5] ).
Inside the function, two variables `begin` and `end` are initialized to -1. and 1. respectively.
The first while loop continues until the product of `poly(xs, begin)` and `poly(xs, end)` is greater than 0.
The second while loop continues until `(end - begin)` is greater than 1e-10.
In each iteration of the second while loop, a variable `center` is calculated as the average of `begin` and `end`.
If the product of `poly(xs, center)` and `poly(xs, begin)` is greater than 0, `begin` is updated to `center`. Otherwise, `end` is updated to `center`.
After the second while loop completes, the function returns the value of `begin`, which is the zero of the polynomial.
