[REASONING]
The function `find_zero` is called with ( xs = [5, 3, -5] ).
Inside the function, two variables `begin` and `end` are initialized to -1. and 1. respectively.
The first while loop continues until the product of `poly(xs, begin)` and `poly(xs, end)` is greater than 0.
The second while loop continues until `(end - begin)` is greater than 1e-10.
In each iteration of the second while loop, a variable `center` is calculated as the average of `begin` and `end`.
If the product of `poly(xs, center)` and `poly(xs, begin)` is greater than 0, `begin` is updated to `center`. Otherwise, `end` is updated to `center`.
After the second while loop completes, the function returns the value of `begin`, which is the zero of the polynomial.

from typing import *
import math


def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_zero(xs: list):
    begin, end = -1., 1.
    while poly(xs, begin) * poly(xs, end) > 0:
        begin *= 2.0
        end *= 2.0
    while end - begin > 1e-10: ## [STATE]((end - begin) > 1e-10)=[True, True, True, True, False][/STATE][STATE](end - begin)=[2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125][/STATE]
        center = (begin + end) / 2.0
        if poly(xs, center) * poly(xs, begin) > 0: ## [CONDITION](poly(xs, center) * poly(xs, begin) > 0)=[True, True, False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y, N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            begin = center
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N, N, Y, Y, N][/BRANCH]
            end = center
    return begin
