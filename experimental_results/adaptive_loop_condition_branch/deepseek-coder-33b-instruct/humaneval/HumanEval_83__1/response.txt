[REASONING]
The function `starts_one_ends` is called with ( n = 2 ).
`n` is 2, which does not equal 1.
The condition `n == 1` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
The method returns `18 * (10 ** (n - 2))` which is `18 * (10 ** (2 - 2))` which is `18 * 1 = 18`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `starts_one_ends(2)` is 18.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def starts_one_ends(n):
    if n == 1: ## [CONDITION](n == 1)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return 1
    return 18 * (10 ** (n - 2))
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
18
