The function `parse_nested_parens` is called with ( paren_string = "((()))" ).
The function `parse_paren_group` is defined inside `parse_nested_parens`.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is in '(', so depth becomes 1 and max_depth becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is in '(', so depth becomes 2 and max_depth becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is in '(', so depth becomes 3 and max_depth becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is not in '(', so depth becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ')' is not in '(', so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ')' is not in '(', so depth becomes 0.

The function `parse_paren_group` returns the max_depth, which is 3.

The function `parse_nested_parens` returns a list with the max_depth, which is [3].
