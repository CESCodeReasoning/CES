[REASONING]
The function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter takes a string txt as input. It splits the string into a list of words using the split(' ') method. The last word in the list is then accessed using the index -1.

The function then checks if the length of the last word is 1 (i.e., it's a single character) and if the ASCII value of the lowercase version of the last character is between 97 and 122 (inclusive), which are the ASCII values for lowercase letters.

In the case of the input "A", the last word is "A", which is a single character. The ASCII value of the lowercase version of "A" is 97, which is between 97 and 122. Therefore, the function returns True.
