[REASONING]
The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'b b b b a' ).
Inside the function, a variable `dict1` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
The string `test` is split into a list `list1`.
The variable `t` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'b' is in `list1` four times, but it is not greater than `t` (which is 0), so it is not added to `dict1`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'a' is in `list1` once, which is greater than `t` (which is 0), so `t` is updated to 1.

After the loop, `t` is 1.

Since `t` is greater than 0, the second loop is executed.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'b' is in `list1` four times, which is equal to `t` (which is 1), so it is added to `dict1` with a value of 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'a' is in `list1` once, which is not equal to `t` (which is 1), so it is not added to `dict1`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `histogram('b b b b a')` is {'b': 1}.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def histogram(test):
    dict1 = {}
    list1 = test.split(" ")
    t = 0

    for i in list1: ## [STATE]i=['b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'a'][/STATE][STATE]list1=['b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'a'][/STATE]
        if (list1.count(i) > t) and i != '': ## [CONDITION]((list1.count(i) > t) and i != '')=[False, False, False, False, True][/CONDITION][CONDITION](i != '')=[True, True, True, True, False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](list1.count(i) > t)=[False, False, False, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            t = list1.count(i)
    if t > 0: ## [CONDITION](t > 0)=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        for i in list1: ## [STATE]i=['b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'a'][/STATE][STATE]list1=['b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'a'][/STATE]
            if (list1.count(i) == t): ## [CONDITION](list1.count(i) == t)=[True, True, True, True, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y, Y, Y, N][/BRANCH]

                dict1[i] = t
    return dict1
