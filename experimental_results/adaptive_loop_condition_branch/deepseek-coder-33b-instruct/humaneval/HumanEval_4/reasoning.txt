The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of floats as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list.

The mean absolute deviation is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between each number and the mean of the numbers.

To calculate the mean absolute deviation of the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], we first calculate the mean of the numbers. The mean is calculated as the sum of the numbers divided by the count of the numbers.

The mean of the numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] is (1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0) / 3 = 2.0.

Next, we calculate the absolute differences between each number and the mean. The absolute differences are calculated as the absolute value of the difference between each number and the mean.

The absolute differences are |1.0 - 2.0|, |2.0 - 2.0|, and |3.0 - 2.0|, which are 1.0, 0.0, and 1.0 respectively.

Finally, we calculate the mean of the absolute differences. The mean is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences divided by the count of the numbers.

The mean of the absolute differences 1.0, 0.0, and 1.0 is (1.0 + 0.0 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.6666666666666666.

Therefore, the output of executing the function mean_absolute_deviation on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] is 0.6666666666666666.
