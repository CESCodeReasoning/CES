[REASONING]
The function `fizz_buzz` is called with ( n = 50 ).
Inside the function, an empty list `ns` is initialized.
The loop iterates from 0 through 49 (since ( n = 50 )).

Iteration 1:
   - `i` is 0, which does not satisfy the condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0`.
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is false.
   - Action: No action is performed.

Iteration 2:
   - `i` is 1, which does not satisfy the condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0`.
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is false.
   - Action: No action is performed.

...

Iteration 11:
   - `i` is 10, which satisfies the condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0`.
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `i` is appended to `ns`.

...

Iteration 23:
   - `i` is 22, which satisfies the condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0`.
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `i` is appended to `ns`.

...

Iteration 44:
   - `i` is 43, which satisfies the condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0`.
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `i` is appended to `ns`.

After the loop completes, `ns` becomes [0, 11, 22, 33, 44].

The list `ns` is then converted to a string `s`, which becomes "011223344".

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
   - `c` is '0', which is not equal to '7'.
   - Action: `ans` remains 0.

Iteration 2:
   - `c` is '1', which is not equal to '7'.
   - Action: `ans` remains 0.

...

Iteration 5:
   - `c` is '7', which is equal to '7'.
   - Action: `ans` becomes 1.

...

After the loop completes, `ans` remains 1.

Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is now 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fizz_buzz(50)` is 1.
