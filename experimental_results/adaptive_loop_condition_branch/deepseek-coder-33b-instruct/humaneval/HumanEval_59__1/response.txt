[REASONING]
The function `largest_prime_factor` is called with ( n = 63 ).
Inside the function, a nested function `is_prime` is defined.
The function `is_prime` checks if a number is prime.
The outer loop iterates from 2 through 63 (since ( n = 63 )).
First Iteration (j = 2)
   - `j` is 2, which is a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 2.
Second Iteration (j = 3)
   - `j` is 3, which is a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 3.
Third Iteration (j = 4)
   - `j` is 4, which is not a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
Fourth Iteration (j = 5)
   - `j` is 5, which is a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 5.
Fifth Iteration (j = 6)
   - `j` is 6, which is not a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
Sixth Iteration (j = 7)
   - `j` is 7, which is a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 7.
Seventh Iteration (j = 8)
   - `j` is 8, which is not a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
Eighth Iteration (j = 9)
   - `j` is 9, which is not a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
Ninth Iteration (j = 10)
   - `j` is 10, which is not a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
Tenth Iteration (j = 11)
   - `j` is 11, which is a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 11.
Eleventh Iteration (j = 12)
   - `j` is 12, which is not a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
Twelfth Iteration (j = 13)
   - `j` is 13, which is a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 13.
Thirteenth Iteration (j = 14)

   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
Fifteenth Iteration (j = 16)
   - `j` is 16, which is not a prime number.
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
Sixteenth Iteration (j = 17)
