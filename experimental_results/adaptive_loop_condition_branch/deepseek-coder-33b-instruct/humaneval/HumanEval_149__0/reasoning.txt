The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["d", "dcba", "abcd", "a"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order.

Iteration 1:
    -The string 'd' has an odd length, so it is not appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 2:
    -The string 'dcba' has an even length, so it is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The string 'abcd' has an even length, so it is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 4:
    -The string 'a' has an odd length, so it is not appended to `new_lst`.

After the loop, `new_lst` is sorted by length in ascending order.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sorted_list_sum(["d", "dcba", "abcd", "a"])` is ['abcd', 'dcba'].
