[REASONING]
The function count_distinct_characters takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string.

The string 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' is concatenated to form 'abcdecadeCADE'.

The function lower() is used to convert all the characters in the string to lowercase.

The set() function is used to get the unique characters in the string.

The len() function is used to get the number of elements in the set, which is the number of distinct characters in the string.

So, the output of executing the function count_distinct_characters on the input 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' is 5.
