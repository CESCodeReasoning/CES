The function `order_by_points` is called with a list of integers.
The function `digits_sum` is defined inside `order_by_points`. It takes an integer `n` as input.
If `n` is negative, it multiplies `n` by -1 and `neg` by -1.
It converts `n` to a list of digits.
If `n` was negative, it multiplies the first digit by -1.
It returns the sum of the digits.
The `order_by_points` function sorts the input list `nums` based on the sum of the digits of each number.

Therefore, the final output of the function `order_by_points([1234,423,463,145,2,423,423,53,6,37,3457,3,56,0,46])` is `[0, 2, 3, 6, 37, 56, 423, 423, 423, 463, 145, 53, 1234, 3457, 46]`.
