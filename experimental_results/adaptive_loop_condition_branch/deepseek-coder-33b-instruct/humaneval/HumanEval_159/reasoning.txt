The function `eat` is called with ( number = 5, need = 6, remaining = 10 ).
`need` is less than or equal to `remaining`, therefore the if branch is taken.
The action: `return [ number + need , remaining-need ]` results in `[ 5 + 6 , 10-6 ]` which is `[11, 4]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `eat(5, 6, 10)` is `[11, 4]`.
