[REASONING]
The function filter_by_prefix takes a list of strings and a prefix as input. It returns a new list that contains only the strings from the input list that start with the given prefix.

To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_prefix on the input ['a', 'ab', 'abc', 'ba', 'bb', 'bc'] and 'a', we need to filter the list to only include the strings that start with 'a'.

The strings that start with 'a' are 'a', 'ab', and 'abc'. Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_by_prefix on the input ['a', 'ab', 'abc', 'ba', 'bb', 'bc'] and 'a' is ['a', 'ab', 'abc'].
