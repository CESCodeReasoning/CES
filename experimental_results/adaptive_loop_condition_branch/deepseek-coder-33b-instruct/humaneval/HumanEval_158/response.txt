[REASONING]
The function find_max takes a list of strings as input. It sorts the list in descending order of the length of the unique characters in each string. If two strings have the same length of unique characters, it sorts them in lexicographical order. The function then returns the first element of the sorted list, which is the string with the most unique characters.

To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "of", "string"], we need to sort the list in the specified way.

1. Sort the list by the length of unique characters in each string.
2. If two strings have the same length of unique characters, sort them in lexicographical order.
3. Return the first element of the sorted list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "of", "string"] is "string".
