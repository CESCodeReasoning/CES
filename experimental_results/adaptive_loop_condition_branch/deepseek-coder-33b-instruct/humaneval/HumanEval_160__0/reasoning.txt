The function `do_algebra` is called with (operator = ['//', '*'], operand = [7, 3, 4]).
Inside the function, a variable `expression` is initialized to '7'.
`zip(operator, operand[1:])` pairs each operator with its corresponding operand.

First Iteration(oprt = '//', oprn = 3):
    expression = '7//3'
Second Iteration(oprt = '*', oprn = 4):
    expression = '7//3*4'

After the loop completes, `eval(expression)` is called which evaluates the string as a Python expression.
The expression '7//3*4' is evaluated as (7//3)*4 = 8*4 = 32.
