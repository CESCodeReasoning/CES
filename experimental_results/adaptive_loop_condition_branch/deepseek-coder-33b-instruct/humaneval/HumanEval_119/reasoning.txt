The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['()(', ')'] ).
Inside the function, two strings S1 and S2 are created by concatenating the first and second elements of the list, and the second and first elements of the list respectively.

The function `check` is defined to check if the parentheses in a string are balanced.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ')' is encountered, but val is already 0, so val remains 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes -1.

The function `check` returns True if the parentheses in a string are balanced, and False otherwise.

In the main function, `check` is called with S1 and S2.

S1 = '()(' + ')' = '()()'
S2 = ')' + '()(' = '())('

For S1, the parentheses are balanced, so `check(S1)` returns True.
For S2, the parentheses are not balanced, so `check(S2)` returns False.

Since `check(S1)` or `check(S2)` is True, the function returns 'Yes'.
