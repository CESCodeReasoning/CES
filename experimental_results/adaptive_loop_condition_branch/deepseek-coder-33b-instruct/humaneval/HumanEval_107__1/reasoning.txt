The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is an odd number and a palindrome.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is true.
    -Action: `odd_palindrome_count += 1` results in `odd_palindrome_count = 1`.

Return Statement
    -After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `(even_palindrome_count, odd_palindrome_count)`, which is now (0, 1).

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_palindrome(1)` is (0, 1).
