The function `how_many_times` is called with ( string = 'xyxyxyx', substring = 'x' ).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The substring 'xyxyxyx'[0:1] is 'x', which is equal to 'x'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is true.
    -Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The substring 'xyxyxyx'[1:2] is 'y', which is not equal to 'x'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is false.
    -Action: `times += 1` is not executed.
Iteration 3:
    -The substring 'xyxyxyx'[2:3] is 'x', which is equal to 'x'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is true.
    -Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The substring 'xyxyxyx'[3:4] is 'y', which is not equal to 'x'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is false.
    -Action: `times += 1` is not executed.
Iteration 5:
    -The substring 'xyxyxyx'[4:5] is 'x', which is equal to 'x'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is true.
    -Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 3.
Iteration 6:
    -The substring 'xyxyxyx'[5:6] is 'y', which is not equal to 'x'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is false.
    -Action: `times += 1` is not executed.
Iteration 7:
    -The substring 'xyxyxyx'[6:7] is 'x', which is equal to 'x'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is true.
    -Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 4.

Return Statement
    -After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `times`, which is now 4.

Therefore, the final output of the function `how_many_times('xyxyxyx', 'x')` is 4.
