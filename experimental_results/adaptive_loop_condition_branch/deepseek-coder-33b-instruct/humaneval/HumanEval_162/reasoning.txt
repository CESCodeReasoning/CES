The function string_to_md5 takes a string text as input. It first checks if the text is not empty. If it is not empty, it encodes the text into ASCII format, computes the MD5 hash of the encoded text, and returns the hexadecimal representation of the hash. If the text is empty, it returns None.

To determine the output of executing the function string_to_md5 on the input 'Hello world', we need to follow the steps outlined above.

The input 'Hello world' is not empty, so we proceed to the next step. We encode 'Hello world' into ASCII format, which gives us the bytes object b'Hello world'.

Next, we compute the MD5 hash of the encoded text. The MD5 hash of b'Hello world' is '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'.

Finally, we return the hexadecimal representation of the hash, which is '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'.
