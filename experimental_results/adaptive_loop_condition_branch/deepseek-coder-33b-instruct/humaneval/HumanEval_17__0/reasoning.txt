The function parse_music takes a string music_string as input. It first defines a dictionary note_map where the keys are musical notes and the values are their corresponding integer values.

The function then splits the input string music_string into a list of substrings using the space character as a delimiter. It then iterates over each substring in the list. If the substring is not empty (i.e., it is not a space character), it looks up the substring in the note_map dictionary and appends the corresponding integer value to the result list.

To determine the output of executing the function parse_music on the input 'o| .| o| .| o o| o o|', we need to split the input string into substrings using the space character as a delimiter. The substrings are 'o|', '.|', 'o|', '.|', 'o', 'o|', 'o', 'o|'.

For each substring, if it is not empty, we look up its value in the note_map dictionary. The values corresponding to 'o|', '.|', 'o|', 'o', 'o|', 'o|' are 2, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4 respectively.

Therefore, the output of executing the function parse_music on the input 'o| .| o| .| o o| o o|' is [2, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4].
