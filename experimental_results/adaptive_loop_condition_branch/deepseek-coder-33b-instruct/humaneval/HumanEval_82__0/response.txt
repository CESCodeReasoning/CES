[REASONING]
The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Wow' ).
The length of the string 'Wow' is 3.

First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which is less than 3.
   - The condition `l % i == 0` is false (since 3 % 2 != 0).
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which is not less than 3.
   - The loop ends.

The function `prime_length` returns True, as no factors of 3 were found.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def prime_length(string):
    l = len(string)
    if l == 0 or l == 1: ## [CONDITION](l == 0 or l == 1)=[False, False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](l == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](l == 1)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N][/BRANCH]
        return False
    for i in range(2, l): ## [STATE]i=[2][/STATE][STATE]range(2, l)=[2][/STATE][STATE]l=[3][/STATE]
        if l % i == 0: ## [CONDITION](l % i == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
            return False
    return True
