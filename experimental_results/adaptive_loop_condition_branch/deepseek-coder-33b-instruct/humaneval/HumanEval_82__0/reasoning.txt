The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Wow' ).
The length of the string 'Wow' is 3.

First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which is less than 3.
   - The condition `l % i == 0` is false (since 3 % 2 != 0).
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which is not less than 3.
   - The loop ends.

The function `prime_length` returns True, as no factors of 3 were found.
