[REASONING]
The function sort_array takes an array arr as input. It first sorts the array in ascending order and then sorts the sorted array again based on the number of 1's in the binary representation of each element.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [], we need to follow the steps:
1. Sort the array [] in ascending order, which gives [].
2. Sort the sorted array [] again based on the number of 1's in the binary representation of each element. Since there are no elements in the array, there are no 1's in the binary representation, so the sorted array remains [].

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [] is [].
