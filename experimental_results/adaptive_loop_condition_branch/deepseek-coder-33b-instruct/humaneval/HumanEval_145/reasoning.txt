The function `order_by_points` is called with ( nums = [1, 11, -1, -11, -12] ).
The function `digits_sum` is defined inside `order_by_points`.
The function `digits_sum` takes an integer `n` as input.
If `n` is negative, it is converted to positive and a flag `neg` is set to -1.
The digits of `n` are converted to a list of integers.
The first digit of `n` is multiplied by `neg`.
The sum of the digits is returned.
The `sorted` function is used to sort `nums` based on the `digits_sum` function.

First Iteration (n = 1)
   - `n` is 1, which is positive.
   - The condition `n < 0` is false.
   - Action: `n` is not changed and `neg` remains 1.
   - `n` is converted to a list of integers, which is `[1]`.
   - The first digit of `n` is multiplied by `neg`, which is `1 * 1 = 1`.
   - The sum of the digits is `1`.
Second Iteration (n = 11)
   - `n` is 11, which is positive.
   - The condition `n < 0` is false.
   - Action: `n` is not changed and `neg` remains 1.
   - `n` is converted to a list of integers, which is `[1, 1]`.
   - The first digit of `n` is multiplied by `neg`, which is `1 * 1 = 1`.
   - The sum of the digits is `2`.
Third Iteration (n = -1)
   - `n` is -1, which is negative.
   - The condition `n < 0` is true.
   - Action: `n` is converted to positive and `neg` is set to -1.
   - `n` is converted to a list of integers, which is `[1]`.
   - The first digit of `n` is multiplied by `neg`, which is `-1 * 1 = -1`.
   - The sum of the digits is `0`.
Fourth Iteration (n = -11)
   - `n` is -11, which is negative.
   - The condition `n < 0` is true.
   - Action: `n` is converted to positive and `neg` is set to -1.
   - `n` is converted to a list of integers, which is `[1, 1]`.
   - The first digit of `n` is multiplied by `neg`, which is `-1 * 1 = -1`.
   - The sum of the digits is `0`.
Fifth Iteration (n = -12)
   - `n` is -12, which is negative.
   - The condition `n < 0` is true.
   - Action: `n` is converted to positive and `neg` is set to -1.
   - `n` is converted to a list of integers, which is `[1, 2]`.
   - The first digit of `n` is multiplied by `neg`, which is `-1 * 1 = -1`.
   - The sum of the digits is `-1`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12])` is `[-1, 1, 11, -11, -12]`.
