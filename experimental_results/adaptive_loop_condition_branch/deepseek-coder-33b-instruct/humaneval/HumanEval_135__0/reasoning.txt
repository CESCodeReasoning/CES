The function `can_arrange` is called with ( arr = [1,2,4,5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The loop iterates from 1 through the length of the array (since len(arr) = 4).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    - `i < len(arr)` when i=1
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - `i < len(arr)` when i=2
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - `i < len(arr)` when i=3
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    - `i < len(arr)` when i=4
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is still -1.
