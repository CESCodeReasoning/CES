The function find_max takes a list of words as input. It sorts the list in descending order of the length of the words and in case of a tie, it sorts them in ascending order of the words themselves. The sorted function returns a list, and we are interested in the first element of this list, which is the word with the maximum length.

To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["play", "this", "game", "of","footbott"], we need to sort the list in the specified way.

After sorting, the list becomes ["footbott", "play", "this", "game", "of"]. Therefore, the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["play", "this", "game", "of","footbott"] is "footbott".
