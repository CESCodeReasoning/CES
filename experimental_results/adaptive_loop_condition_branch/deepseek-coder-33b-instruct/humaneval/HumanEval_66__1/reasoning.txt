The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "aAaaaXa" ).
`s` is "aAaaaXa", which does not equal to "".
The condition `s == ""` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
The function returns the sum of the ASCII values of the uppercase characters in the string.
In this case, the uppercase characters are 'A' and 'X', whose ASCII values are 65 and 88 respectively.
Therefore, the final output of the function `digitSum("aAaaaXa")` is 65 + 88 = 153.
