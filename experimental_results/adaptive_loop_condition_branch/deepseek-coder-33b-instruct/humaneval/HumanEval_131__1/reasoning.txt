The function `digits` is called with ( n = 5576543 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` and `odd_count` are initialized to 1 and 0 respectively.

Iteration 1:
    -The digit '5' is odd, so product becomes 5 and odd_count becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The digit '5' is odd, so product becomes 25 and odd_count becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The digit '7' is odd, so product becomes 175 and odd_count becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The digit '6' is not odd, so product remains 175 and odd_count remains 3.
Iteration 5:
    -The digit '5' is odd, so product becomes 875 and odd_count becomes 4.
Iteration 6:
    -The digit '4' is not odd, so product remains 875 and odd_count remains 4.
Iteration 7:
    -The digit '3' is odd, so product becomes 30375 and odd_count becomes 5.

The condition `odd_count == 0` is false, so the `else` block is executed.

Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `product`, which is now 30375.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digits(5576543)` is 30375.
