The function `compare_one` is called with ( a = 1, b = 2 ).
`a` and `b` are integers, so the conditions `isinstance(temp_a, str)` and `isinstance(temp_b, str)` are false.
The condition `float(temp_a) == float(temp_b)` is also false, because 1 is not equal to 2.
Therefore, the `if` and `elif` branches are not taken, and the function returns `a` if `float(temp_a) > float(temp_b)`, which is false, so it returns `b`, which is 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one(1, 2)` is 2.
