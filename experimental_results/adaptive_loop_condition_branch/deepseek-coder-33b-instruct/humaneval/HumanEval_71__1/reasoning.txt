The function `triangle_area` is called with ( a = 1, b = 2, c = 10 ).
`a`, `b`, and `c` do not form a valid triangle as the sum of any two sides is less than or equal to the third side.
The condition `a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken and the method returns -1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `triangle_area(1, 2, 10)` is -1.
