[REASONING]
The function `triangle_area` is called with ( a = 1, b = 2, c = 10 ).
`a`, `b`, and `c` do not form a valid triangle as the sum of any two sides is less than or equal to the third side.
The condition `a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken and the method returns -1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `triangle_area(1, 2, 10)` is -1.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a: ## [CONDITION](a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a)=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](b + c <= a)=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](a + b <= c)=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](a + c <= b)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return -1
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
    area = round(area, 2)
    return area

[OUTPUT]
