[REASONING]
The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and returns True if n is even and greater than or equal to 8. Otherwise, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 4, we need to check if 4 is even and greater than or equal to 8.

4 is an even number because it can be divided by 2 without a remainder.

4 is not greater than or equal to 8.

Therefore, the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 4 is False.
