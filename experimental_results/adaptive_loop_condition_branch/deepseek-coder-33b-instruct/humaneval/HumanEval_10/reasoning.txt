The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( string = 'jerry' ).
The condition ( not string ) is not satisfied, therefore the else branch is taken.
The variable `beginning_of_suffix` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates until the condition ( is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) ) is satisfied.
First Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 0):
    - The condition ( is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) ) is not satisfied, therefore `beginning_of_suffix` is incremented by 1.
Second Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 1):
    - The condition ( is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) ) is not satisfied, therefore `beginning_of_suffix` is incremented by 1.
Third Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 2):
    - The condition ( is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) ) is not satisfied, therefore `beginning_of_suffix` is incremented by 1.
Fourth Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 3):
    - The condition ( is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) ) is not satisfied, therefore `beginning_of_suffix` is incremented by 1.
Fifth Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 4):
    - The condition ( is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) ) is not satisfied, therefore `beginning_of_suffix` is incremented by 1.
After the loop completes, the function returns the string 'jerry' concatenated with the reverse of the string 'jerry' ( 'jerry' ) as the output.
