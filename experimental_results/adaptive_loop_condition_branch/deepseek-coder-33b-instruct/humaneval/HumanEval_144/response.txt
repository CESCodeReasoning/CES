[REASONING]
The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "1/5", n = "5/1" ).
The function splits the input strings into numerators and denominators.
The numerator is calculated as the product of the numerators of x and n.
The denominator is calculated as the product of the denominators of x and n.
The condition `numerator/denom == int(numerator/denom)` is checked.
Here, `numerator` is 5 and `denom` is 25.
`numerator/denom` is 0.2, which is not equal to `int(numerator/denom)` which is 0.
Therefore, the if branch is not taken and the method returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("1/5", "5/1")` is False.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def simplify(x, n):
    a, b = x.split("/")
    c, d = n.split("/")
    numerator = int(a) * int(c)
    denom = int(b) * int(d)
    if (numerator/denom == int(numerator/denom)): ## [CONDITION](numerator/denom == int(numerator/denom))=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return True
    return False

[OUTPUT]
False
