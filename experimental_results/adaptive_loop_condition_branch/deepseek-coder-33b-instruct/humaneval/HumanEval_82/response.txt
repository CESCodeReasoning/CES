[REASONING]
The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Hello' ).
The length of the string 'Hello' is 5.
The condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is false (since 5 is not equal to 0 or 1).
The loop iterates from 2 through 4 (since the length of the string is 5).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which does not divide 5.
   - The condition `l % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which does not divide 5.
   - The condition `l % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
Third Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which does not divide 5.
   - The condition `l % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
Fourth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which does not divide 5.
   - The condition `l % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
No iteration satisfies the condition `l % i == 0`, so the function returns True.

from typing import *
def prime_length(string):
    l = len(string)
    if l == 0 or l == 1: ## [CONDITION](l == 0 or l == 1)=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](l == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](l == 1)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return False
    for i in range(2, l): ## [STATE]i=[2, 3, 4, 5][/STATE][STATE]range(2, l)=[2, 3, 4][/STATE][STATE]l=[5][/STATE]
        if l % i == 0: ## [CONDITION](l % i == 0)=[False, False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            return False
    return True
