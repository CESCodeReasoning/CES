The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Hello' ).
The length of the string 'Hello' is 5.
The condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is false (since 5 is not equal to 0 or 1).
The loop iterates from 2 through 4 (since the length of the string is 5).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which does not divide 5.
   - The condition `l % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which does not divide 5.
   - The condition `l % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
Third Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which does not divide 5.
   - The condition `l % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
Fourth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which does not divide 5.
   - The condition `l % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
No iteration satisfies the condition `l % i == 0`, so the function returns True.
