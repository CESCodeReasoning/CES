[REASONING]
The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'aaaaa' ).
Inside the function, the loop iterates from 0 through 4 (since `len(text)` is 5).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `text[i]` is 'a' and `text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is also 'a'.
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
   - Action: The function continues to the next iteration.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `text[i]` is 'a' and `text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is also 'a'.
   - The condition is false.
   - Action: The function continues to the next iteration.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `text[i]` is 'a' and `text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is also 'a'.
   - The condition is false.
   - Action: The function continues to the next iteration.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `text[i]` is 'a' and `text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is also 'a'.
   - The condition is false.
   - Action: The function continues to the next iteration.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `text[i]` is 'a' and `text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is also 'a'.
   - The condition is false.
   - Action: The function continues to the next iteration.

Since the condition is always false, the function returns True, indicating that the string is a palindrome.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def is_palindrome(text: str):
    for i in range(len(text)): ## [STATE]i=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4][/STATE][STATE]range(len(text))=[5][/STATE][STATE]len(text)=[5][/STATE]
        if text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]: ## [CONDITION](text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i])=[False, False, False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            return False
    return True
