The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'aaaaa' ).
Inside the function, the loop iterates from 0 through 4 (since `len(text)` is 5).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `text[i]` is 'a' and `text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is also 'a'.
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
   - Action: The function continues to the next iteration.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `text[i]` is 'a' and `text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is also 'a'.
   - The condition is false.
   - Action: The function continues to the next iteration.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `text[i]` is 'a' and `text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is also 'a'.
   - The condition is false.
   - Action: The function continues to the next iteration.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `text[i]` is 'a' and `text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is also 'a'.
   - The condition is false.
   - Action: The function continues to the next iteration.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `text[i]` is 'a' and `text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is also 'a'.
   - The condition is false.
   - Action: The function continues to the next iteration.

Since the condition is always false, the function returns True, indicating that the string is a palindrome.
