The function `intersection` is called with ( interval1 = [-1, 1], interval2 = [0, 4] ).

The function `is_prime` checks if a number is prime.

The function `intersection` calculates the intersection of two intervals.

The intersection of two intervals is defined as the interval that contains all points that are in both intervals.

In this case, the intersection of [-1, 1] and [0, 4] is [0, 1].

The length of this intersection is 1 - 0 = 1.

The function `is_prime` checks if 1 is a prime number.

1 is not a prime number, so the function `intersection` returns "NO".
