The function `is_happy` is called with ( s = "aabb" ).
The length of the string is 4, which is not less than 3.
The loop iterates from 0 through 1 (since ( len(s) - 2 ) is 2).

First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `s[i]` is 'a', `s[i + 1]` is 'a', and `s[i + 2]` is 'b'.
   - The condition `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]` is true (`s[i] == s[i + 1]` is true).
   - Action: `return False`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_happy("aabb")` is False.
