The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '01-01-2007' ).
The date string is stripped of leading and trailing spaces.
The date string is split into month, day, and year components.
The month, day, and year are converted to integers.
The month is checked to be between 1 and 12.
   - The month is 1, which satisfies ( 1 <= month <= 12 ).
   - The condition `month < 1 or month > 12` is false.
   - The if branch is not taken.
The day is checked to be between 1 and 31 for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12.
   - The month is 1, which is in the list [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12].
   - The day is 1, which satisfies ( 1 <= day <= 31 ).
   - The condition `month in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and day < 1 or day > 31` is false.
   - The if branch is not taken.
The day is checked to be between 1 and 30 for months 4, 6, 9, 11.
   - The month is 1, which is not in the list [4, 6, 9, 11].
   - The condition `month in [4, 6, 9, 11] and day < 1 or day > 30` is false.
   - The if branch is not taken.
The day is checked to be between 1 and 29 for month 2.
   - The month is 1, which is not 2.
   - The condition `month == 2 and day < 1 or day > 29` is false.
   - The if branch is not taken.
No exceptions are raised during the execution of the function.
