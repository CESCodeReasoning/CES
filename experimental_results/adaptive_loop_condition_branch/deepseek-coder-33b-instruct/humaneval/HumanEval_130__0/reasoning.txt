The function `tri` is called with ( n = 20 ).

First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which does not satisfy ( i == 0 ).
   - The condition `i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return [1]` returns `[1]`.

Second Iteration (i = 1)

Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which satisfies ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` updates `my_tri` to `[1, 3, 2]`.

Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which does not satisfy ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` updates `my_tri` to `[1, 3, 2, 6]`.

Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which satisfies ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.

Sixth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which does not satisfy ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` updates `my_tri` to `[1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 10]`.

Seventh Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is 6, which satisfies ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` updates `my_tri` to `[1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 10, 4]`.

Eighth Iteration (i = 7)
