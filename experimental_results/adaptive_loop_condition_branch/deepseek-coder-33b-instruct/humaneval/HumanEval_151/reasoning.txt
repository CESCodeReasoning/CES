The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input. It then iterates over each number in the list. If the number is greater than 0, is odd, and does not contain a decimal point, it squares the number and adds it to the sum.

For the input [0.2, 3, 5], the function will only consider the number 5, as it is the only number in the list that is greater than 0, is odd, and does not contain a decimal point. Therefore, the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [0.2, 3, 5] is 25.
