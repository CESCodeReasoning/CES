The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string that contains the sequence of numbers from 0 to n, separated by spaces.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 10, we need to generate a string that contains the sequence of numbers from 0 to 10, separated by spaces.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 10 is "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10".
