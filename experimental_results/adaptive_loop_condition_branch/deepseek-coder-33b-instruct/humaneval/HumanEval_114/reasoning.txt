The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `s` is updated to `-2`.
    - `s` is less than 0, so `s` is reset to 0.
    - `max_sum` remains 0.
Iteration 2:
    - `s` is updated to `-5`.
    - `s` is less than 0, so `s` is reset to 0.
    - `max_sum` remains 0.
Iteration 3:
    - `s` is updated to `-9`.
    - `s` is less than 0, so `s` is reset to 0.
    - `max_sum` remains 0.
Iteration 4:
    - `s` is updated to `-10`.
    - `s` is less than 0, so `s` is reset to 0.
    - `max_sum` remains 0.
Iteration 5:
    - `s` is updated to `-12`.
    - `s` is less than 0, so `s` is reset to 0.
    - `max_sum` remains 0.
Iteration 6:
    - `s` is updated to `-16`.
    - `s` is less than 0, so `s` is reset to 0.
    - `max_sum` remains 0.

Since `max_sum` is still 0, the condition `max_sum == 0` is true.
Therefore, `max_sum` is updated to the maximum negative number in `nums`, which is `-1`.

Finally, `min_sum` is calculated as `-max_sum`, which is `1`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4])` is 1.
