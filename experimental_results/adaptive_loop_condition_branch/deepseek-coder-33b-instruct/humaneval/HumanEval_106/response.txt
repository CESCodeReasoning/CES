[REASONING]
The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if the current number is even or odd.
If the number is even, it calculates the factorial of the number and appends it to the list ret.
If the number is odd, it calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to the current number and appends it to the list ret.
First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, which is odd.
    - x = 0, j in the inner loop is 1.
    - x += j, j in the inner loop is [1]. x becomes 1.
    - Append 1 to ret.
Second Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, which is even.
    - x = 1, j in the inner loop is 1, 2.
    - x *= j, j in the inner loop is [1, 2]. x becomes 2.
    - Append 2 to ret.
Third Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, which is odd.
    - x = 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3.
    - x += j, j in the inner loop is [1, 2, 3]. x becomes 6.
    - Append 6 to ret.
Fourth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, which is even.
    - x = 1, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4.
    - x *= j, j in the inner loop is [1, 2, 3, 4]. x becomes 24.
    - Append 24 to ret.
Fifth Iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, which is odd.
    - x = 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
    - x += j, j in the inner loop is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. x becomes 15.
    - Append 15 to ret.
