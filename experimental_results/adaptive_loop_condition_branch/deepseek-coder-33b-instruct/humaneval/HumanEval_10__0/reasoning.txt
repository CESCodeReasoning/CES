The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( string = 'xyx' ).
The condition ( not string ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The variable `beginning_of_suffix` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates until the condition ( not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) ) is satisfied.
First Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 0):
    - The condition ( not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) ) is not satisfied, therefore the loop continues.
Second Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 1):
    - The condition ( not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) ) is not satisfied, therefore the loop continues.
Third Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 2):
    - The condition ( not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) ) is satisfied, therefore the loop breaks.
The function returns the string 'xyx' + 'x'[::-1] = 'xyxx' as the output.
