The function `count_nums` is called with ( arr = [1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5] ).
Inside the function, a helper function `digits_sum` is defined.
The function `digits_sum` takes an integer `n` as input.
If `n` is negative, it is converted to positive and a flag `neg` is set to -1.
The digits of `n` are converted to a list of integers.
The first digit is multiplied by `neg`.
The sum of the digits is returned.
The main function `count_nums` returns the count of positive numbers in the list of sums of digits of the numbers in `arr`.

First Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which is positive.
   - The condition `i > 0` is true.
   - Action: `count` is incremented by 1.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which is positive.
   - The condition `i > 0` is true.
   - Action: `count` is incremented by 1.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which is positive.
   - The condition `i > 0` is true.
   - Action: `count` is incremented by 1.
Fourth Iteration (i = -2)
   - `i` is -2, which is negative.
   - The condition `i > 0` is false.
   - Action: `count` is not incremented.
Fifth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which is positive.
   - The condition `i > 0` is true.
   - Action: `count` is incremented by 1.
Sixth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which is positive.
   - The condition `i > 0` is true.
   - Action: `count` is incremented by 1.
Seventh Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which is positive.
   - The condition `i > 0` is true.
   - Action: `count` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `count_nums([1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5])` is 6.
