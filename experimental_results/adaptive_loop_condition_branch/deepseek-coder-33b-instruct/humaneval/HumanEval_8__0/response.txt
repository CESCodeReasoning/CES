[REASONING]
The function `sum_product` is called with an empty list (numbers = [] ).
Inside the function, two variables `sum_value` and `prod_value` are initialized to 0 and 1 respectively.
The loop iterates over the list `numbers` which is empty.
Since the list is empty, the loop does not execute.
After the loop completes, the function returns the values of `sum_value` and `prod_value`, which are still 0 and 1 respectively.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    sum_value = 0
    prod_value = 1

    for n in numbers: ## [STATE]numbers=[][/STATE]
        sum_value += n
        prod_value *= n
    return sum_value, prod_value
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
(0, 1)
[/OUTPUT]
