The function `longest` is called with ( strings = ['x', 'y', 'z'] ).

First Iteration:
    - The condition `not strings` is false, so the `if` block is not executed.

Second Iteration:
    - The variable `maxlen` is set to the maximum length of the strings in the list, which is 1.

Third Iteration:
    - The variable `s` is set to the first string in the list, which is 'x'.
    - The condition `len(s) == maxlen` is true, so the function returns 'x'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `longest(['x', 'y', 'z'])` is 'x'.
