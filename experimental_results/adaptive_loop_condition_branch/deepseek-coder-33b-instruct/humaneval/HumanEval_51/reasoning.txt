The function remove_vowels takes a string text as input. It then creates a new string by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is not a vowel (i.e., it is not in the list ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]), it is included in the new string. The function then returns this new string.

To determine the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input 'fedcba', we need to create a new string by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is not a vowel (i.e., it is not in the list ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]), it is included in the new string.

The characters in 'fedcba' are 'f', 'e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a'. The vowels are 'e', 'a'. So, the new string is 'fdcba'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input 'fedcba' is 'fdcba'.
