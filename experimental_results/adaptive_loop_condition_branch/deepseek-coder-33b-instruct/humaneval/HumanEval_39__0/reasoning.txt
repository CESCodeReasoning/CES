The function `prime_fib` is called with ( n = 9 ).
Inside the function, a list `f` is initialized with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1).
The loop continues indefinitely.
In each iteration, a new Fibonacci number is calculated by adding the last two numbers in the list.
The function `is_prime` is then called with the last number in the list.
If the number is prime, `n` is decremented.
If `n` reaches 0, the function returns the last number in the list.

First Iteration:
    - The last number in the list is 1.
    - The number is not prime, so `n` is not decremented.
Second Iteration:
    - The last number in the list is 1.
    - The number is not prime, so `n` is not decremented.
Third Iteration:
    - The last number in the list is 2.
    - The number is prime, so `n` is decremented to 8.
Fourth Iteration:
    - The last number in the list is 3.
    - The number is prime, so `n` is decremented to 7.
Fifth Iteration:
    - The last number in the list is 5.
    - The number is prime, so `n` is decremented to 6.
Sixth Iteration:
    - The last number in the list is 8.
    - The number is not prime, so `n` is not decremented.
Seventh Iteration:
    - The last number in the list is 13.
    - The number is prime, so `n` is decremented to 5.
Eighth Iteration:
    - The last number in the list is 21.
    - The number is not prime, so `n` is not decremented.
Ninth Iteration:
    - The last number in the list is 34.
    - The number is not prime, so `n` is not decremented.
Tenth Iteration:
    - The last number in the list is 55.
    - The number is not prime, so `n` is not decremented.
Eleventh Iteration:
    - The last number in the list is 89.
    - The number is not prime, so `n` is not decremented.

    - The last number in the list is 144.
    - The number is not prime, so `n` is not decremented.
Thirteenth Iteration:
    - The last number in the list is 233.
    - The number is not prime, so `n` is not decremented.
Fourteenth Iteration:
    - The last number in the list is 377.
    - The number is not prime, so `n` is not decremented.
Fifteenth Iteration:
    - The last number in the list is 610.
    - The number is not prime, so `n` is not decremented.
Sixteenth Iteration:
    - The last number in the list is 987.
    - The number is prime, so `n` is decremented to 4.
