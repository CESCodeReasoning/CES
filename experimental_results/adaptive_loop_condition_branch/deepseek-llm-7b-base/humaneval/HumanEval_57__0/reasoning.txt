The function `monotonic` is called with ( l = [4, 1, 0, -10] ).
`l` is [4, 1, 0, -10], which satisfies ( 4 <= 4, 1 <= 1, 0 <= 0, -10 <= -10 ).
The condition `l == sorted(l)` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns True

The condition `l == sorted(l, reverse=True)` is also true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns True

Therefore, the final output of the function `monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10]` is True.
