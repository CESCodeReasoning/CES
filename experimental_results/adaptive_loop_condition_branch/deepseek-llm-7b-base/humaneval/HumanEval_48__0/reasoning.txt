Iteration 1:
    -The character 'x' is not equal to the character 'z', so the function returns False.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'y' is not equal to the character 'x', so the function returns False.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'w' is not equal to the character 'z', so the function returns False.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'w' is not equal to the character 'x', so the function returns False.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 'w' is not equal to the character 'y', so the function returns False.
Iteration 6:
    -The character 'w' is not equal to the character 'z', so the function returns False.
Iteration 7:
    -The character 'z' is not equal to the character 'x', so the function returns False.
Iteration 8:
    -The character 'z' is not equal to the character 'y', so the function returns False.
Iteration 9:
    -The character 'z' is not equal to the character 'w', so the function returns False.
Iteration 10:
