The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input and returns the next smallest integer in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we need to find the next smallest integer in the list.
The list is sorted in ascending order, so the next smallest integer is the second smallest integer in the list, which is 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 2.
