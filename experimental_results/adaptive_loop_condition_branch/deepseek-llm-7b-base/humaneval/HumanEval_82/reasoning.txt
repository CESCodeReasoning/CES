Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the length of the string.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'H' is not in the range of 2 to l, so the loop continues.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'e' is in the range of 2 to l, so the loop continues.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'l' is not in the range of 2 to l, so the loop continues.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'l' is not in the range of 2 to l, so the loop continues.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 'o' is in the range of 2 to l, so the loop continues.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ',' is not in the range of 2 to l, so the loop continues.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not in the range of 2 to l, so the loop continues.
Iteration 8:
    -The character 'W' is not in the range of 2 to l, so the loop continues.
Iteration 9:
    -The character 'o' is in the range of 2 to l, so the loop continues.
Iteration 10:
    -The character 'r' is not in the range of 2 to l, so the loop continues.
Iteration 11:
    -The character 'l' is not in the range of 2 to l, so the loop continues.
Iteration 12:
    -The character 'd' is not in the range of 2 to l, so the loop continues.
Iteration 13:
    -The character '!' is not in the range of 2 to l, so the loop continues.
