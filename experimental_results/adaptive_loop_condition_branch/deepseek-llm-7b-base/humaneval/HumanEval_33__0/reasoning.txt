The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of the third elements of l.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], we need to sort the third elements of the input list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] is [3, 2, -5, -3, 0, 1, -10].
