The function reverse_delete takes two strings s and c as input and returns a tuple containing the reversed string s and a boolean value indicating whether s is a palindrome.
To determine the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcde" and "ae", we need to reverse the string "abcde" and check if it is a palindrome.
Therefore, the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcde" and "ae" is ("bcdea", True).
