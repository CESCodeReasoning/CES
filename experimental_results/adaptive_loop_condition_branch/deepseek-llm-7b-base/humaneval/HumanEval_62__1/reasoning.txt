The function derivative takes a list xs as input and returns a list of the derivatives of the elements of xs.
To determine the output of executing the function derivative on the input [3, 2, 1], we need to calculate the derivatives of the elements of the input.
Therefore, the output of executing the function derivative on the input [3, 2, 1] is [6, 4, 2].
