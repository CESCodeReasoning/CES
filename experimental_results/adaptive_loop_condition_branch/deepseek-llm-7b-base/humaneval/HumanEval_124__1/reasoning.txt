The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '04-2003' ).
The function tries to convert the input string to a date.
The input string is converted to a list of three integers: month, day, and year.
The month, day, and year are converted to integers.
The month is checked to ensure it is between 1 and 12.
The day is checked to ensure it is between 1 and 31.
The year is checked to ensure it is between 1900 and 2099.
If any of these checks fail, the function returns False.
If all checks pass, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('04-2003')` is True.
