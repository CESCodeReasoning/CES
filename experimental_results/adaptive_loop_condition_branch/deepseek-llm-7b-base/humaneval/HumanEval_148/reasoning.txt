The function `bf` is called with ( planet1 = "Jupiter" and planet2 = "Neptune" ).
`planet1` is "Jupiter", which satisfies ( planet1 not in planet_names or planet2 not in planet_names or planet1 == planet2 ) (since `planet1` is not in the list of planet names).
The condition `planet1 not in planet_names` is true.
The condition `planet1 == planet2` is false.
The condition `planet1 not in planet_names` is true.
The condition `planet2 not in planet_names` is true.
The condition `planet1 == planet2` is false.
The condition `planet1 not in planet_names` is true.
The condition `planet2 not in planet_names` is true.
The condition `planet1 == planet2` is false.
