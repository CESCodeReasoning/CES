The function get_row takes a list lst and a value x as input and returns a list of tuples representing the coordinates of the first occurrence of x in lst.
To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [], we need to find the first occurrence of 1 in the empty list.
Since there is no element in the empty list, the function returns an empty list.
