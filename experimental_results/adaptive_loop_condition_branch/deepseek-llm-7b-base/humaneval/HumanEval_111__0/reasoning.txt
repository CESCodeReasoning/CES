The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'a b c d g' ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `dict1` is initialized to `{}`.
The list `list1` is initialized to `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'g']`.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'a' is in the list, so the count of 'a' is incremented.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'b' is in the list, so the count of 'b' is incremented.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'c' is in the list, so the count of 'c' is incremented.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'd' is in the list, so the count of 'd' is incremented.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 'g' is in the list, so the count of 'g' is incremented.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not in the list, so the count of ' ' is not incremented.
Iteration 7:
    -The character 'h' is not in the list, so the count of 'h' is not incremented.
Iteration 8:
    -The character 'i' is not in the list, so the count of 'i' is not incremented.
Iteration 9:
    -The character 'j' is not in the list, so the count of 'j' is not incremented.
Iteration 10:
    -The character 'k' is not in the list, so the count of 'k' is not incremented.
Iteration 11:
    -The character 'l' is not in the list, so the count of 'l' is not incremented.
Iteration 12:
    -The character 'm' is not in the list, so the count of 'm' is not incremented.
Iteration 13:
    -The character 'n' is not in the list, so the count of 'n' is not incremented.
Iteration 14:
    -The character 'o' is not in the list, so the count of 'o' is not incremented.
Iteration 15:
    -The character 'p' is not in the list, so the count of 'p' is not incremented.
Iteration 16:
    -The character 'q' is not in the list, so the count of 'q' is not incremented.
Iteration 17:
