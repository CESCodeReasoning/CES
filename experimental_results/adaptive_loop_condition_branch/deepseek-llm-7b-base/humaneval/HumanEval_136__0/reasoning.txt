The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest and smallest integers in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the empty list, we need to determine the largest and smallest integers in the empty list.
Since there are no integers in the empty list, the largest and smallest integers are None.
Therefore, the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the empty list is (None, None).
