The function find_max takes a list of strings as input and returns the first string in the list that is sorted in descending order by the length of its set of unique characters and then by the string itself.
To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "of", "string"], we need to sort the input list in descending order by the length of its set of unique characters and then by the string itself.
Therefore, the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "of", "string"] is "of".
