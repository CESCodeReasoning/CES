The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the range(1, n + 1).
In the inner loop, for each element i in the outer loop, check if i is even.
If i is even, multiply i by each element in the range(1, i + 1).
If i is odd, add each element in the range(1, i + 1) to a variable x.
The function returns a list of all the results.
First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3.
    - `i` is even, multiply `i` by each element in the range(1, i + 1):
        - `i` is 1, `i` is even, multiply `i` by each element in the range(1, i + 1):
            - `i` is 1, `i` is even, multiply `i` by each element in the range(1, i + 1):
                - `i` is 1, `i` is even, multiply `i` by each element in the range(1, i + 1):
                    - `i` is 1, `i` is even, multiply `i` by each element in the range(1, i + 1):
