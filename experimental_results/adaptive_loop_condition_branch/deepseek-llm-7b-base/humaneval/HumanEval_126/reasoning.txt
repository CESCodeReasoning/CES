The function `is_sorted` is called with ( lst = [5] ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `count_digit` is initialized with the key-value pairs ( 5, 0 ).
The loop iterates from 0 through 0 (since ( len(lst) = 1 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    count_digit[i] = 1, `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit[i]` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst) ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `False` as the output.
