The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input and returns the next smallest integer in the list.
To determine the next smallest integer in the list [5, 1, 4, 3, 2], we need to find the smallest integer that is not already in the list.
The smallest integer that is not already in the list is 1.
Therefore, the next smallest integer in the list [5, 1, 4, 3, 2] is 1.
