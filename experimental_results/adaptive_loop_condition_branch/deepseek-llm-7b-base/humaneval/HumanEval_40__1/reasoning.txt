The function triples_sum_to_zero(l) takes a list of numbers as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, iterate through every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
    - l[i]=2: compare with 4, -5, 3, 9, 7:
        - When j = 1 (l[j]=4), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=-5), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=3), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (l[j]=9), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (l[j]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
    - l[i]=4: compare with 2, -5, 3, 9, 7:
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=2), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=-5), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (l[j]=3), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (l[j]=9), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 6 (l[j]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5, 6.
    - l[i]=5: compare with 2, -5, 3, 9
