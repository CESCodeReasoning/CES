The function common(l1, l2) takes two lists as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the first list, l1.
The inner loop iterates through each element in the second list, l2.
First Iteration (l1=[5, 3, 2, 8], l2=[3, 2]):
    - `l1[i]=5`: compare with `l2[j]=3`:
        - When `j=0`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=1`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=2`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Add 5 to ret.
    - `l1[i]=3`: compare with `l2[j]=2`:
        - When `j=0`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=1`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=2`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - `l1[i]=2`: compare with `l2[j]=8`:
        - When `j=0`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=1`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=2`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - `l1[i]=8`: compare with `l2[j]=2`:
        - When `j=0`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=1`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=2`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
