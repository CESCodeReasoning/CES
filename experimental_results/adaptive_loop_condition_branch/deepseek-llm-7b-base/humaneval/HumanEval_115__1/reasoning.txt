The function max_fill takes a 2D list of integers representing the grid and a positive integer representing the capacity as input.
The function returns the maximum number of filled cells in the grid, assuming that each cell can be filled with at most one unit of water.
To determine the maximum number of filled cells in the grid, we need to calculate the sum of the water volume of each cell in the grid.
The water volume of a cell is the product of the cell's width and height, multiplied by the capacity.
Therefore, the maximum number of filled cells in the grid is the sum of the water volume of each cell in the grid, divided by the capacity.
