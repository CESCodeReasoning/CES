The function `starts_one_ends` is called with ( n = 4 ).
`n` is 4, which satisfies ( 1 <= n < 5 ).
The condition `n == 1` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken and the method returns 18 * (10 ** (n - 2))

Therefore, the final output of the function `starts_one_ends(4)` is 18 * (10 ** (4 - 2)) = 18 * (10 ** 2) = 180.
