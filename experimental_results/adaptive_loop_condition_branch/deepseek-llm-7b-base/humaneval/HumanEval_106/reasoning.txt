The function f(n) takes a number n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the range(1, n + 1).
In the inner loop, for each element i in the outer loop, check if i is even.
If i is even, multiply i by each element in the range(1, i + 1).
If i is odd, add each element in the range(1, i + 1) to a variable x.
The function returns a list of all the results.
First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
    - `i` is even, multiply `i` by each element in the range(1, i + 1):
        - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
        - `i` is even, multiply `i` by each element in the range(1, i + 1):
            - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
            - `i` is even, multiply `i` by each element in the range(1, i + 1):
                - `i` is 8, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
                - `i` is even, multiply `i` by each element in the range(1, i + 1):
                    - `i` is 16, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
                    - `i` is even, multiply `i` by each element in the range(1, i + 1):
                        - `i` is 32, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
                        - `i` is even, multiply `i` by each element in the range(1, i + 1):
                            - `i` is 64, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
                            - `i` is even, multiply `i` by each element in the range(1, i + 1):
                                - `i` is 128, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
                                - `i` is even, multiply `i` by each element in the range(1, i + 1):
                                    - `i` is 256, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
                                    - `i` is even, multiply `i` by each element in the range(1, i + 1):
                                        - `i` is 512, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
                                        - `i` is even, multiply `i` by each element in the range(1, i + 1):
                                            - `i` is 1024, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4,
