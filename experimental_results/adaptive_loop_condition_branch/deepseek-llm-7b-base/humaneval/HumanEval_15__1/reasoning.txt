The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string consisting of the numbers from 0 to n.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 10, we need to concatenate the numbers from 0 to 10.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 10 is "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9".
