The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of `l`, which is 1.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of `l` is 1, which is greater than `m`, so the condition `e > m` is true.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element of `l` is 2, which is greater than `m`, so the condition `e > m` is true.
Iteration 3:
    -The third element of `l` is 3, which is not greater than `m`, so the condition `e > m` is false.
