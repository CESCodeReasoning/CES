The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string consisting of n spaces and n + 1 numbers from 0 to n.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3, we need to concatenate 3 spaces and 3 + 1 numbers from 0 to 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3 is " 0 1 2 3 ".
