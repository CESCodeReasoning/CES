The function `any_int` is called with ( x = 2, y = 3, z = 1 ).
`x` is an integer, which satisfies (isinstance(x, int)).
`y` is an integer, which satisfies (isinstance(y, int)).
`z` is an integer, which satisfies (isinstance(z, int)).
The if branch is taken.
`x` is 2, which satisfies ( x + y == z ) but doesn't satisfy ( x + z == y ) or ( y + z == x ). Thus, the condition `(x+y==z) or (x+z==y) or (y+z==x)` is False, and the branch is not taken.
The else branch is taken.

Therefore, the final output of the function `any_int(2, 3, 1)` is False.
