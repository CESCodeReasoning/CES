The function encode takes a string message as input and returns a string that encodes the message.
To determine the output of executing the function encode on the input "I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE", we need to encode the message "I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE".
Therefore, the output of executing the function encode on the input "I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE" is "I D0N'T K0W W0R3T".
