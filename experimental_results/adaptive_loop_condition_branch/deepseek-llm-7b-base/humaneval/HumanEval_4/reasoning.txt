The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of floats as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list.
To determine the mean absolute deviation of the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], we need to calculate the mean of the list and then calculate the absolute deviation of each element from the mean.
Therefore, the mean absolute deviation of the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] is 1.0.
