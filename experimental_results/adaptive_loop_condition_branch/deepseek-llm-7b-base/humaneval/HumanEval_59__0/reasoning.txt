The function `largest_prime_factor` is called with ( n = 330 ).
Inside the function, a variable `largest` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 2 through 330 (since ( n = 330 )).
First Iteration (j = 2)
   - `j` is 2, which satisfies ( 2 <= j < 330 ).
   - The condition `j % i == 0` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 2.
Second Iteration (j = 3)
   - `j` is 3, which satisfies ( 3 <= j < 330 ).
   - The condition `j % i == 0` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 3.
Third Iteration (j = 4)
   - `j` is 4, which satisfies ( 4 <= j < 330 ).
   - The condition `j % i == 0` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 4.
Fourth Iteration (j = 5)
   - `j` is 5, which satisfies ( 5 <= j < 330 ).
   - The condition `j % i == 0` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 5.
Fifth Iteration (j = 6)
   - `j` is 6, which satisfies ( 6 <= j < 330 ).
   - The condition `j % i == 0` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 6.
Sixth Iteration (j = 7)
   - `j` is 7, which satisfies ( 7 <= j < 330 ).
   - The condition `j % i == 0` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 7.
Seventh Iteration (j = 8)
   - `j` is 8, which satisfies ( 8 <= j < 330 ).
   - The condition `j % i == 0` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 8.
Eighth Iteration (j = 9)
   - `j` is 9, which satisfies ( 9 <= j < 330 ).
   - The condition `j % i == 0` is true.
   - Action: `largest = max(largest, j)` updates `largest` to 9.
Ninth Iteration (j = 10)
   - `j` is 10, which satisfies ( 10 <= j < 330 ).
   - The condition `j % i == 0` is true
