The function solution takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list that are odd.
To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [2, 4, 8], we need to find the sum of all even numbers in the list that are odd.
The even numbers in the list are 2 and 4, and the odd numbers are 8.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [2, 4, 8] is 10.
