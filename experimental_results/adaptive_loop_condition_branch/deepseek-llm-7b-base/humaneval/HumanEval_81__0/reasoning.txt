The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( word = "racecar" ).
Inside the function, a variable `word` is initialized to `"racecar"`.
The function checks if the word is equal to its reverse, i.e. `word == word[::-1]`.
If the word is equal to its reverse, the function returns `True`.
Otherwise, the function returns `False`.
