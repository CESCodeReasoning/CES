The function right_angle_triangle takes three integers a, b, and c as input and returns True if the triangle formed by the sides a, b, and c is a right-angled triangle, or False otherwise.
To determine whether the triangle formed by the sides a, b, and c is a right-angled triangle, we need to check if the following conditions are met:
a * a == b * b + c * c
b * b == a * a + c * c
c * c == a * a + b * b
Therefore, the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input (7, 24, 25) is True.
