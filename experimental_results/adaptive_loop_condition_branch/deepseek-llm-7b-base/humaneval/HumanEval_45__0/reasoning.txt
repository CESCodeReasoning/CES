The function triangle_area takes two parameters, a and h, which represent the length of the base and the height of a triangle, respectively.
To calculate the area of a triangle, we need to multiply the length of the base by the height and divide the result by 2.0.
Therefore, the area of a triangle with a base length of 10 and a height of 8 is 10 * 8 / 2.0 = 40.
