The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest and smallest integers in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [-1, -3, -5, -6], we need to find the largest and smallest integers in the list.
The largest integer in the list is -1, and the smallest integer is -6.
Therefore, the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [-1, -3, -5, -6] is (-1, -6).
