The function iscube takes an integer a as input and returns True if a is a perfect cube, and False otherwise.
To determine whether the input 1 is a perfect cube, we need to determine whether 1 is a perfect cube.
Since 1 is a positive integer, we can use the function abs to convert it to its absolute value.
Then, we can use the function round to round the value to the nearest integer.
Finally, we can use the function int to convert the rounded value to an integer.
Therefore, the output of executing the function iscube on the input 1 is True.
