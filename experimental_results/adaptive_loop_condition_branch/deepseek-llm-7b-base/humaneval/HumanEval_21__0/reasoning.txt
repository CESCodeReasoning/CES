The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers that have been rescaled to the unit range of [0, 1].
To rescale the numbers in the list to the unit range, we need to subtract the minimum number from each number and divide the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum numbers.
Therefore, the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] is [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0].
