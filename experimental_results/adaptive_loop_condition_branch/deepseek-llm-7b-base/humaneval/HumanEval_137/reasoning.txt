The function `compare_one` is called with ( a = 1, b = 2 ).
`a` is 1, which satisfies ( 1 <= a < 3 ).
`b` is 2, which satisfies ( 1 <= b < 3 ).
The condition `isinstance(temp_a, str)` and `isinstance(temp_b, str)` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns None.

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one(1, 2)` is None.
