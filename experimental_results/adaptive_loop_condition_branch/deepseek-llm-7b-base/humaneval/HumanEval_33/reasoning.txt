The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of every third element of l.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to sort every third element of [1, 2, 3].
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2].
