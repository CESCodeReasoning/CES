Iteration 8:
    -The character 's' is in the list, so the list becomes ['H', 'i', ' ', 'm', 'y', 'a', 'n', 's'].
Iteration 9:
    -The character 'i' is in the list, so the list becomes ['H', 'i', ' ', 'm', 'y', 'a', 'n', 's', 'i'].
Iteration 10:

Iteration 13:
    -The character 'w' is in the list, so the list becomes ['H', 'i', ' ', 'm', 'y', 'a', 'n', 's', 'i', 's', 'e', 'o', 'w'].
Iteration 14:
    -The character 'l' is in the list, so the list becomes ['H', 'i', ' ', 'm', 'y', 'a', 'n', 's', 'i', 's', 'e', 'o', 'w', 'l'].
