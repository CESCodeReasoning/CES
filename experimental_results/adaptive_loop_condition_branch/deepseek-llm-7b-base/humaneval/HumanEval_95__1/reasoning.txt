The function `check_dict_case` is called with ( dict = {"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"} ).
Inside the function, a variable `state` is initialized to `"start"`.

Iteration 1:

    -The condition `key.isupper()` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "lower"` is false.

    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
