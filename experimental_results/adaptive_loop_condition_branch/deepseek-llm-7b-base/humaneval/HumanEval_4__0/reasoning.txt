The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers.
To determine the mean absolute deviation of the numbers, we need to calculate the mean of the numbers and then calculate the absolute deviation of each number from the mean.
Therefore, the mean absolute deviation of the numbers is the sum of the absolute deviations of each number from the mean divided by the number of numbers.
