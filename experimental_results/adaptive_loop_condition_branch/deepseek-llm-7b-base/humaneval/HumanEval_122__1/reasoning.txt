The function add_elements takes an array arr and a number k as input and returns the sum of the elements in arr that have a length of at most 2.
To determine the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9] and k = 4, we need to find the sum of the elements in arr that have a length of at most 2.
The elements in arr that have a length of at most 2 are [11, 21, 3, 90, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
Therefore, the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9] and k = 4 is 11 + 21 + 3 + 90 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 240.
