The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest and smallest integers in the list.
To determine the largest and smallest integers in the list, we need to iterate over the list and compare each integer to the previous one.
If the current integer is larger than the previous one, we can set the largest integer to the current integer.
Similarly, if the current integer is smaller than the previous one, we can set the smallest integer to the current integer.
Once we have determined the largest and smallest integers in the list, we can return them as a tuple.
