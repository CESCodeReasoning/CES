The function filter_by_substring takes a list of strings strings and a substring substring as input and returns a list of strings that contain the substring in them.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input [], "john", we need to determine if the substring "john" is present in any of the strings in the list [].
Since the list [] does not contain any strings, the function filter_by_substring returns an empty list [] as its output.
