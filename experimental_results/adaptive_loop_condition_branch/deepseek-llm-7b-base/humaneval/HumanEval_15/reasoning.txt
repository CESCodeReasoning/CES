The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string consisting of n spaces and n + 1 numbers from 0 to n.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 0, we need to concatenate 0 spaces and 0 numbers from 0 to 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 0 is "0 ".
