The function count_distinct_characters takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function count_distinct_characters on the input "abcde" + "cade" + "CADE", we need to count the number of distinct characters in the concatenation of the three strings.
Therefore, the output of executing the function count_distinct_characters on the input "abcde" + "cade" + "CADE" is 5.
