The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( n = 121 ).
Inside the function, a variable `n` is initialized to 121.
The function checks if `n` is less than 0.
If `n` is less than 0, the function returns False.
Otherwise, the function returns True.
Therefore, the final output of the function `is_palindrome(121)` is True.
