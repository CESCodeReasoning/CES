The function get_row takes a list of lists and a value x as input and returns a list of tuples representing the coordinates of the first occurrence of x in each row of the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2, we need to find the first occurrence of 2 in the first row of the input list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2 is [(0, 0)].
