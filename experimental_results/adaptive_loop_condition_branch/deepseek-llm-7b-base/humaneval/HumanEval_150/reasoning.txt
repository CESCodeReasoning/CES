The function `is_prime` is called with ( n = 7 ).
Inside the function, a variable `n` is initialized to 7.
The loop iterates from 2 through 7 (since ( n = 7 )).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < 7 ).
   - The condition `i < 7` is true.
   - Action: `n % i` evaluates to 0, which is false.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which satisfies ( 3 <= i < 7 ).
   - The condition `i < 7` is true.
   - Action: `n % i` evaluates to 0, which is false.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Third Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which satisfies ( 4 <= i < 7 ).
   - The condition `i < 7` is true.
   - Action: `n % i` evaluates to 0, which is false.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Fourth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which satisfies ( 5 <= i < 7 ).
   - The condition `i < 7` is true.
   - Action: `n % i` evaluates to 0, which is false.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Fifth Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is 6, which satisfies ( 6 <= i < 7 ).
   - The condition `i < 7` is true.
   - Action: `n % i` evaluates to 0, which is false.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Sixth Iteration (i = 7)
   - `i` is 7, which satisfies ( 7 <= i < 7 ).
   - The condition `i < 7` is false.
   - Action: `n % i` evaluates to 0, which is false.
   - The loop completes.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `is_prime`, which is now `False`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_prime(7)` is `False`.
