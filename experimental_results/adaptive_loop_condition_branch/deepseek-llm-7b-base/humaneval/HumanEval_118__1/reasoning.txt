Iteration 5:
    -The character 'a' is in vowels, so the function returns 'a'.
Iteration 6:
    -The character 'a' is in vowels, so the function returns 'a'.
Iteration 7:
    -The character 'a' is in vowels, so the function returns 'a'.
Iteration 8:
    -The character 'a' is in vowels, so the function returns 'a'.
Iteration 9:
    -The character 'a' is in vowels, so the function returns 'a'.
Iteration 10:
    -The character 'a' is in vowels, so the function returns 'a'.
Iteration 11:
    -The character 'a' is in vowels, so the function returns 'a'.
Iteration 12:
    -The character 'a' is in vowels, so the function returns 'a'.
