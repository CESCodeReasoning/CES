The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The value of `i` is 0, which satisfies ( i % 3 = 0 ) and ( i % 4 != 0 ).
    -The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
    -The condition `i % 4 != 0` is false.
    -The action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` updates `result` to [0, 1, 4, 9].
Iteration 2:
    -The value of `i` is 1, which satisfies ( i % 3 = 0 ) and ( i % 4 != 0 ).
    -The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
    -The condition `i % 4 != 0` is false.
    -The action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` updates `result` to [0, 1, 4, 9, 1].
Iteration 3:
    -The value of `i` is 2, which satisfies ( i % 3 != 0 ) and ( i % 4 != 0 ).
    -The condition `i % 3 != 0` is true.
    -The condition `i % 4 != 0` is false.
    -The action: `result.append(lst[i]**3)` updates `result` to [0, 1, 4, 9, 1, 81].
Iteration 4:
    -The value of `i` is 3, which satisfies ( i % 3 != 0 ) and ( i % 4 != 0 ).
    -The condition `i % 3 != 0` is true.
    -The condition `i % 4 != 0` is false.
    -The action: `result.append(lst[i]**3)` updates `result` to [0, 1, 4, 9, 1, 81, 27].
Iteration 5:
    -The value of `i` is 4, which satisfies ( i % 3 != 0 ) and ( i % 4 != 0 ).
    -The condition `i % 3 != 0` is true.
    -The condition `i % 4 != 0` is false.
    -The action: `result.append(lst[i])` updates `result` to [0, 1, 4, 9, 1, 81, 27, 4].
Iteration 6:
