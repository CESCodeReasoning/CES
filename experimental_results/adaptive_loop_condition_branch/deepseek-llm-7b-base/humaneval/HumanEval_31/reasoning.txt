The function `is_prime` is called with ( n = 6 ).
Inside the function, a variable `n` is initialized to 6.
The loop iterates from 2 through 6 (since ( n = 6 )).
First Iteration (k = 2)
   - `k` is 2, which satisfies ( 2 <= k < 6 ).
   - The condition `k < 6` is true.
   - Action: `n % k` results in `6 % 2 = 0`.
Second Iteration (k = 3)
   - `k` is 3, which satisfies ( 3 <= k < 6 ).
   - The condition `k < 6` is true.
   - Action: `n % k` results in `6 % 3 = 0`.
Third Iteration (k = 4)
   - `k` is 4, which satisfies ( 4 <= k < 6 ).
   - The condition `k < 6` is true.
   - Action: `n % k` results in `6 % 4 = 0`.
Fourth Iteration (k = 5)
   - `k` is 5, which satisfies ( 5 <= k < 6 ).
   - The condition `k < 6` is true.
   - Action: `n % k` results in `6 % 5 = 0`.
Fifth Iteration (k = 6)
   - `k` is 6, which satisfies ( 6 <= k < 6 ).
   - The condition `k < 6` is true.
   - Action: `n % k` results in `6 % 6 = 0`.
Therefore, the final output of the function `is_prime(6)` is `False`.
