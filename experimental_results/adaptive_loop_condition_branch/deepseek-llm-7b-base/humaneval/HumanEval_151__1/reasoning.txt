The function double_the_difference takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the integers in the list that are greater than 0, are not divisible by 2, and do not contain a decimal point.
To determine the output of executing the function double_the_difference on an empty list, we need to determine the sum of the squares of the integers in the empty list that are greater than 0, are not divisible by 2, and do not contain a decimal point.
Since there are no integers in the empty list that meet these criteria, the output of executing the function double_the_difference on an empty list is 0.
