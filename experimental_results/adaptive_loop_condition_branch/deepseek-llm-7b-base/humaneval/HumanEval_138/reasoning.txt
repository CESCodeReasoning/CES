The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and returns True if n is even and greater than or equal to 8, and False otherwise.
To determine whether the input 4 is equal to the sum of even numbers greater than or equal to 8, we need to check if 4 is even and greater than or equal to 8.
Since 4 is even and greater than or equal to 8, the function is_equal_to_sum_even returns True.
