The function `even_odd_count` is called with ( num = -345821 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_count` and `odd_count` are initialized to 0.

    -The character '4' is not in the range of 0 to 9, so odd_count becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '5' is not in the range of 0 to 9, so odd_count becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '8' is not in the range of 0 to 9, so odd_count becomes 4.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '2' is not in the range of 0 to 9, so odd_count becomes 5.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '1' is not in the range of 0 to 9, so odd_count becomes 6.
