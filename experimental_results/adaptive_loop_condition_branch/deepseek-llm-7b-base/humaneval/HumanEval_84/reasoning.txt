The function solve takes an integer N as input and returns the binary representation of the sum of all the digits in the string representation of N.
To determine the output of executing the function solve on the input 1000, we need to sum all the digits in the string representation of 1000.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solve on the input 1000 is "1010".
