The function `order_by_points` is called with ( nums = [1, 11, -1, -11, -12] ).
Inside the function, a variable `nums` is initialized to the list [1, 11, -1, -11, -12].
The function `digits_sum` is called with ( n = -12 ).
The condition `n < 0` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns `-12`.
The function `digits_sum` is called with ( n = -11 ).
The condition `n < 0` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns `-11`.
