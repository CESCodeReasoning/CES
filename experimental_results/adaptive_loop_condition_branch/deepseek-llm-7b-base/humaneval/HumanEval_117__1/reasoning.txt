The function select_words(s, n) takes a string s and an integer n as its parameters.
The function splits the string s into a list of words using the split() method.
The for loop iterates through each word in the list of words.
The variable n_consonants keeps track of the number of consonants in the current word.
The for loop iterates through each character in the current word.
If the current character is not a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), then the variable n_consonants is incremented by 1.
If the number of consonants in the current word is equal to n, then the current word is added to the result list.
The return statement returns the result list.
