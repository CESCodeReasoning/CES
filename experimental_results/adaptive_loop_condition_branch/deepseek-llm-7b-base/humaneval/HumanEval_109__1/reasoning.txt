    -The character 'a' is in s, so the function returns True.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'c' is in s, so the function returns True.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'e' is in s, so the function returns True.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 'c' is in s, so the function returns True.
Iteration 6:
    -The character 'a' is in s, so the function returns True.
Iteration 7:
    -The character 'r' is in s, so the function returns True.
Iteration 8:
    -The character 'e' is in s, so the function returns True.
Iteration 9:
    -The character 'c' is in s, so the function returns True.
Iteration 10:
    -The character 'a' is in s, so the function returns True.
Iteration 11:
    -The character 'r' is in s, so the function returns True.
Iteration 12:
