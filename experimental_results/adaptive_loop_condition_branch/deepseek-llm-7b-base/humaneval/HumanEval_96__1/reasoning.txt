The function count_up_to(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each number from 2 to n.
In the inner loop, for each number i in the outer loop, check if it is prime by iterating through each number j from 2 to i.
First Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
    - `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `i % j` is 0, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is_prime` is False, `is
