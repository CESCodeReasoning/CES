The function solution takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list that are odd.
To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32], we need to find the sum of all even numbers in the list that are odd.
The first even number in the list is 30, which is odd.
The second even number in the list is 13, which is odd.
The third even number in the list is 23, which is odd.
The fourth even number in the list is 32, which is odd.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32] is 30 + 13 + 23 + 32 = 98.
