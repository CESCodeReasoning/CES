The function `rounded_avg` is called with ( n = 1, m = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `summation` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( m = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 3 ( 1 + 2 = 3 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 6 ( 3 + 3 = 6 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 10 ( 6 + 4 = 10 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 15 ( 10 + 5 = 15 ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( m - n + 1 > 0 ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `10101` as the output.
