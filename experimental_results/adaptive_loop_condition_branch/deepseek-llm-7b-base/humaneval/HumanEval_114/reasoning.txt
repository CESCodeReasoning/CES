The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of the array is 2, which is added to `s` and `max_sum`.
    -Since `s` is negative, the `if` condition is true and `s` is set to 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element of the array is 3, which is added to `s` and `max_sum`.
    -Since `s` is negative, the `if` condition is true and `s` is set to 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The third element of the array is 4, which is added to `s` and `max_sum`.
    -Since `s` is negative, the `if` condition is true and `s` is set to 0.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth element of the array is 1, which is added to `s` and `max_sum`.
    -Since `s` is negative, the `if` condition is true and `s` is set to 0.
Iteration 5:
    -The fifth element of the array is 2, which is added to `s` and `max_sum`.
    -Since `s` is negative, the `if` condition is true and `s` is set to 0.
Iteration 6:
    -The sixth element of the array is 4, which is added to `s` and `max_sum`.
    -Since `s` is negative, the `if` condition is true and `s` is set to 0.
Iteration 7:
    -The seventh element of the array is 2, which is added to `s` and `max_sum`.
    -Since `s` is negative, the `if` condition is true and `s` is set to 0.
Iteration 8:
    -The eighth element of the array is 4, which is added to `s` and `max_sum`.
    -Since `s` is negative, the `if` condition is true and `s` is set to 0.
Iteration 9:
    -The ninth element of the array is 4, which is added to `s` and `max_sum`.
    -Since `s` is negative, the `if` condition is true and `s` is set to 0.
Iteration 10:
    -The tenth element of the array is 4, which is added to `s` and `max_sum`.
    -Since `s` is negative, the `if` condition is true and `s` is set to 0.
Iteration 11:
    -The eleventh element of the array is 4, which is added to `s` and `max_sum`.
    -Since `s` is negative, the `if` condition is true and `s` is set to 0.
Iteration 12:
    -The twelfth element of the array is 4, which
