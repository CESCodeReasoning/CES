The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input and returns the next smallest integer in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the empty list [], we need to find the next smallest integer in the empty list.
Since there are no integers in the empty list, the next smallest integer is None.
Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the empty list [] is None.
