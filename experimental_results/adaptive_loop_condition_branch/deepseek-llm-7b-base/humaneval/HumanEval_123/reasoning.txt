The function `get_odd_collatz` is called with ( n = 14 ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_collatz` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 1 through 14 (since ( n = 14 )).
First Iteration (n = 1):
    - n <= 14 when n=1
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is true. The second branch is taken.
    -`odd_collatz.append(n)` updates `odd_collatz` to [1].
Second Iteration (n = 2):
    - n <= 14 when n=2
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is true. The second branch is taken.
    -`odd_collatz.append(n)` updates `odd_collatz` to [1, 2].
Third Iteration (n = 3):
    - n <= 14 when n=3
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is true. The second branch is taken.
    -`odd_collatz.append(n)` updates `odd_collatz` to [1, 2, 3].
Fourth Iteration (n = 4):
    - n <= 14 when n=4
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is true. The second branch is taken.
    -`odd_collatz.append(n)` updates `odd_collatz` to [1, 2, 3, 4].
Fifth Iteration (n = 5):
    - n <= 14 when n=5
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is true. The second branch is taken.
    -`odd_collatz.append(n)` updates `odd_collatz` to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Sixth Iteration (n = 6):
    - n <= 14 when n=6
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is true. The second branch is taken.
    -`odd_collatz.append(n)` updates `odd_collatz` to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
Seventh Iteration (n = 7):
    - n <= 14 when n=7
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is true. The second branch is taken.
    -`odd_collatz.append(n)` updates `odd
