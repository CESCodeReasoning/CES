The function compare takes two lists as input and returns a list of the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of the two lists.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], we need to compare the corresponding elements of the two lists and return the absolute differences between them.
Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
