The function filter_by_prefix takes a list of strings and a prefix as input and returns a list of strings that start with the given prefix.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_prefix on the input [], "john", we need to determine if any of the strings in the list start with the given prefix "john".
Since there are no strings in the list, the function returns an empty list.
