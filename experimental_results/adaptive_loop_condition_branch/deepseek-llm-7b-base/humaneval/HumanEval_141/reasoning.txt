The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = "example.txt" ).
The function splits the file name into two parts, `lst = file_name.split(sep='.')`.
The length of the list `lst` is 2, which satisfies ( len(lst) != 2 ).
The condition `not lst[1] in suf` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns `No`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `file_name_check("example.txt")` is `No`.
