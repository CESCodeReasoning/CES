The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of floats as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list.
To determine the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list, we need to calculate the mean of the numbers and then calculate the absolute deviation of each number from the mean.
Therefore, the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list is the sum of the absolute deviations of each number from the mean divided by the length of the list.
