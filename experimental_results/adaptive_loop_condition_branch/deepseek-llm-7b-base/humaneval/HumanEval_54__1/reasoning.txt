The function same_chars takes two strings s0 and s1 as input and returns True if the sets of characters in s0 and s1 are equal, and False otherwise.
To determine whether the sets of characters in "eabcd" and "dddddddabc" are equal, we need to compare the sets of characters in each string.
The set of characters in "eabcd" is {"e", "a", "b", "c", "d"}.
The set of characters in "dddddddabc" is {"d", "d", "d", "d", "d", "a", "b", "c"}.
Since the sets of characters in "eabcd" and "dddddddabc" are not equal, the function same_chars returns False.
