The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input and returns a string that is the concatenation of the words in s, with each word being sorted in alphabetical order.
To determine the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input "Hello World!!!", we need to concatenate the words in "Hello World!!!", sorted in alphabetical order.
Therefore, the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input "Hello World!!!" is "Hello World!!!".
