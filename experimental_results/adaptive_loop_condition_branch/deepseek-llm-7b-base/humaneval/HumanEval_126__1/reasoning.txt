The function `is_sorted` is called with ( lst = [3, 2, 1] ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `count_digit` is initialized with the key-value pairs ( 3, 0 ), ( 2, 0 ), and ( 1, 0 ).
The loop iterates from 0 through 2 (since ( len(lst) = 3 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit` to ( 3, 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit` to ( 2, 2 ).
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit` to ( 1, 3 ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst) ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `False` as the output.
