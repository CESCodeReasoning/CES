The function encode takes a string message as input and returns the encoded version of the message.
To determine the output of executing the function encode on the input "YES", we need to encode the string "YES".
The string "YES" contains the letters "Y", "E", and "S".
The letter "Y" is encoded to "Y", the letter "E" is encoded to "E", and the letter "S" is encoded to "S".
Therefore, the output of executing the function encode on the input "YES" is "YES".
