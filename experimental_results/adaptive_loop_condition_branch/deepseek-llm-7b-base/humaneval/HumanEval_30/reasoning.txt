The function get_positive takes a list l as input and returns a list of all positive elements in l.
To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6], we need to find all positive elements in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6] is [4, 5, 6].
