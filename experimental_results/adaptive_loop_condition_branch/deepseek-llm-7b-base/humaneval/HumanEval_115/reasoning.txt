The function max_fill takes a 2D list grid and a positive integer capacity as input and returns the maximum number of filled cells in the grid.
To determine the maximum number of filled cells in the grid, we need to calculate the sum of the number of filled cells in each row and column of the grid.
Therefore, the maximum number of filled cells in the grid is 3.
