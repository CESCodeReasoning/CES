The function `is_prime` is called with (n = 10 ).
Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to 2.
The loop iterates from 2 to 10 ( since ( n = 10 )).
First Iteration (i = 2):
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 ( 10 % 2 = 0 ).
Since `n % i` evaluates to 0, the loop exits and the function returns False.
