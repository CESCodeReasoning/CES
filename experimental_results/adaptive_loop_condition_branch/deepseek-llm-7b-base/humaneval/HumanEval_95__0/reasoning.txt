The function `check_dict_case` is called with ( dict = {"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345" } ).
Inside the function, a variable `state` is initialized to `"start"`.

Iteration 1:
    -The key `"STATE"` is a string, so the condition `isinstance(key, str) == False` is false.
    -The condition `state == "start"` is true.
    -The condition `key.isupper()` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "mixed"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
    -The condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` is false.
