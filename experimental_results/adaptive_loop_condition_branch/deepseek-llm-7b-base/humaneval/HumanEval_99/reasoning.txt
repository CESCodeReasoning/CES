The function `closest_integer` is called with ( value = 10 ).
The function checks if the number of decimal places in the input is 1.
If the number of decimal places is 1, then the trailing zeros are removed from the input.
The function then converts the input to a floating-point number.
If the last two digits of the input are '.5', then the function checks if the number is greater than 0.
If the number is greater than 0, then the function returns the ceiling of the number.
If the number is less than 0, then the function returns the floor of the number.
If the number has more than one decimal place, then the function returns the integer closest to the input.
