The function sort_array takes an array arr as input and returns a sorted array.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4], we need to sort the array [1,5,2,3,4].
The sorted array is [1,2,3,4,5].
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4] is [1,2,3,4,5].
