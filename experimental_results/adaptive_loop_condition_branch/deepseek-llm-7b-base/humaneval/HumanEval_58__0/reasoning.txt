The function common(l1, l2) takes two lists as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the first list, l1.
The inner loop iterates through each element in the second list, l2.
First Iteration (l1=[4, 3, 2, 8], l2=[3, 2, 4]):
    - `l1[i]=4`: compare with `l2[j]=3`, `l2[j]=2`, `l2[j]=8`:
        - When `j=0`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=1`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=2`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Add 4 to ret.
        - When `j=3`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (l1=[4, 3, 2, 8], l2=[3, 2, 4]):
    - `l1[i]=3`: compare with `l2[j]=3`, `l2[j]=2`, `l2[j]=4`:
        - When `j=0`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=1`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=2`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=3`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Add 3 to ret.
        - When `j=4`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (l1=[4, 3, 2, 8], l2=[3, 2, 4]):
    - `l1[i]=2`: compare with `l2[j]=2`, `l2[j]=4`:
        - When `j=0`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=1`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=2`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Add 2 to ret.
        - When `j=3`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (l1=[4, 3, 2, 8], l2=[3, 2, 4]):
    - `l1[i]=8`: compare with `l2[j]=8`:
        - When `j=0`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=1`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `j=2`, the condition `l1[i] == l2[j]` is False
