The function compare takes two lists as input and returns a list of the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of the two lists.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input [1,2,3,5] and [-1,2,3,4], we need to calculate the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of the two lists.
Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input [1,2,3,5] and [-1,2,3,4] is [1,1,1,1].
