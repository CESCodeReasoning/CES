The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is not a palindrome, so the condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1` is true, so the branch `taken = Y` is taken.
    -The condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false, so the branch `taken = N` is taken.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 2 is a palindrome, so the condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is true.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1` is true, so the branch `taken = Y` is taken.
    -The condition `is_palindrome(i)` is true, so the branch `taken = Y` is taken.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 3 is not a palindrome, so the condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1` is true, so the branch `taken = Y` is taken.
    -The condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false, so the branch `taken = N` is taken.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 4 is a palindrome, so the condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is true.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1` is true, so the branch `taken = Y` is taken.
    -The condition `is_palindrome(i)` is true, so the branch `taken = Y` is taken.
Iteration 5:
    -The number 5 is not a palindrome, so the condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1` is true, so the branch `taken = Y` is taken.
    -The condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false, so the branch `taken = N` is taken.
Iteration 6:
    -The number 6 is a palindrome, so the condition `i % 2 ==
