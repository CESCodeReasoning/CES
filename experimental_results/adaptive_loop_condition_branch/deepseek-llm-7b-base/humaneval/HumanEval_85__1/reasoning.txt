The function add takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even-indexed elements in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 4, 6, 8], we need to sum the even-indexed elements in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 4, 6, 8] is 12.
