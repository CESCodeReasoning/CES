The function find_closest_elements(numbers) takes a list of numbers as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by idx in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (idx=0):
    - `idx` is 0, idx2 in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5.
    - `elem` is 1.0, `elem2` is 2.0, `distance` is None.
    - `idx2` is 1, `elem2` is 2.0, `distance` is None.
    - `elem` is 2.0, `elem2` is 3.0, `distance` is None.
    - `idx2` is 2, `elem2` is 4.0, `distance` is None.
    - `elem` is 3.0, `elem2` is 5.0, `distance` is None.
    - `idx2` is 3, `elem2` is 2.2, `distance` is None.
    - `elem` is 4.0, `elem2` is 5.0, `distance` is None.
    - `idx2` is 4, `elem2` is 3.0, `distance` is None.
    - `elem` is 5.0, `elem2` is 2.2, `distance` is None.
    - `idx2` is 5, `elem2` is 4.0, `distance` is None.
    - `elem` is 2.2, `elem2` is 4.0, `distance` is None.
    - `idx2` is 6, `elem2` is 4.0, `distance` is None.
    - `elem` is 2.2, `elem2` is 4.0, `distance` is None.
    - `idx2` is 7, `elem2` is 4.0, `distance` is None.
    - `elem` is 2.2, `elem2` is 4.0, `distance` is None.
    - `idx2` is 8, `elem2` is 4.0, `distance` is None.
    - `elem` is 2.2, `elem2` is 4.0, `distance` is None.
    - `idx2` is 9, `elem2` is 4.0, `distance` is None.
    - `elem` is 2.2, `elem2` is 4
