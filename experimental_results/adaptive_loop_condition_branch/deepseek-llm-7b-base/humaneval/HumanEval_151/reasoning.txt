The function double_the_difference takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the integers in the list that are greater than 0, have odd parity, and do not contain a decimal point.
To determine the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [0.2, 3, 5], we need to find the sum of the squares of the integers in the list that meet the criteria.
The first integer in the list, 0.2, does not meet the criteria, so we can ignore it.
The second integer in the list, 3, meets the criteria, so we can add it to the sum.
The third integer in the list, 5, meets the criteria, so we can add it to the sum.
Therefore, the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [0.2, 3, 5] is 12.
