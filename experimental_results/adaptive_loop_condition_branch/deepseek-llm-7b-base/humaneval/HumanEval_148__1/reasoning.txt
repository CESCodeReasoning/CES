The function `bf` is called with ( planet1 = "Mercury" and planet2 = "Uranus" ).
`planet1` is "Mercury", which satisfies ( planet1 not in planet_names or planet2 not in planet_names or planet1 == planet2 )
`planet2` is "Uranus", which satisfies ( planet1 not in planet_names or planet2 not in planet_names or planet1 == planet2 )
`planet1` and `planet2` are not equal, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns ().

Therefore, the final output of the function `bf("Mercury", "Uranus")` is ().
