The function `is_prime` is called with ( n = 10 ).
Inside the function, a variable `n` is initialized to 10.
The loop iterates from 2 through 10 (since ( n = 10 )).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < 10 ).
   - The condition `i < 10` is true.
   - Action: `n % i` evaluates to 0, which is false.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which satisfies ( 3 <= i < 10 ).
   - The condition `i < 10` is true.
   - Action: `n % i` evaluates to 0, which is false.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Third Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which satisfies ( 4 <= i < 10 ).
   - The condition `i < 10` is true.
   - Action: `n % i` evaluates to 0, which is false.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Fourth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which satisfies ( 5 <= i < 10 ).
   - The condition `i < 10` is true.
   - Action: `n % i` evaluates to 0, which is false.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Fifth Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is 6, which satisfies ( 6 <= i < 10 ).
   - The condition `i < 10` is true.
   - Action: `n % i` evaluates to 0, which is false.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Sixth Iteration (i = 7)
   - `i` is 7, which satisfies ( 7 <= i < 10 ).
   - The condition `i < 10` is true.
   - Action: `n % i` evaluates to 0, which is false.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Seventh Iteration (i = 8)
   - `i` is 8, which satisfies ( 8 <= i < 10 ).
   - The condition `i < 10` is true.
   - Action: `n % i` evaluates to 0, which is false.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Eighth Iteration (i = 9)
   - `i` is 9, which satisfies ( 9 <= i < 10 ).
   - The condition `i < 10` is true.
   - Action: `n % i` evaluates to 0, which is false.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
