The function reverse_delete takes two arguments: s, which is a string, and c, which is a set of characters.
The function returns a tuple consisting of two elements: the first element is the reversed string s, and the second element is a boolean value indicating whether the reversed string s is equal to the original string s.
To determine the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcdedcba" and the set of characters "v", we need to reverse the string "abcdedcba" and check whether the reversed string is equal to the original string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcdedcba" and the set of characters "v" is ("dcba", True).
