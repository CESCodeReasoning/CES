The function triangle_area takes two parameters, a and h, representing the length of the base and the height of a triangle, respectively.
To calculate the area of a triangle, we need to use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is given by the following equation:
Area = 1/2 * base * height

In this case, the base of the triangle is a and the height is h.
Therefore, the area of the triangle is given by the following equation:
Area = 1/2 * a * h

To calculate the area of the triangle, we need to multiply the length of the base, a, by the height, h, and divide the result by 2.0.
Therefore, the area of the triangle is given by the following equation:
Area = a * h / 2.0

The function triangle_area returns the area of the triangle as a floating-point number.
