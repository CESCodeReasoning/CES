The function double_the_difference takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the integers in the list that are greater than 0, are not divisible by 2, and do not contain a decimal point.
To determine the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [-10, -20, -30], we need to find the sum of the squares of the integers in the list that are greater than 0, are not divisible by 2, and do not contain a decimal point.
Therefore, the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [-10, -20, -30] is 100.
