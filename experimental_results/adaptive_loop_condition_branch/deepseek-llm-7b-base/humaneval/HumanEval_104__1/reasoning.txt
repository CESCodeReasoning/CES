The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( x = [12345, 2033, 111, 151] ).
Inside the function, a variable `x` is initialized to the input list.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of the input list is 12345.
    -The first element of the reversed list is 54321.
    -The first element of the input list is equal to the first element of the reversed list.
    -The function returns True.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element of the input list is 2033.
    -The second element of the reversed list is 3320.
    -The second element of the input list is not equal to the second element of the reversed list.
    -The function returns False.
Iteration 3:
    -The third element of the input list is 111.
    -The third element of the reversed list is 111.
    -The third element of the input list is equal to the third element of the reversed list.
    -The function returns True.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth element of the input list is 151.
    -The fourth element of the reversed list is 115.
    -The fourth element of the input list is not equal to the fourth element of the reversed list.
    -The function returns False.
