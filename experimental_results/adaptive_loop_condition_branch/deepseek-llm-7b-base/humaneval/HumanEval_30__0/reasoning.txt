The function get_positive takes a list l as input and returns a list of all positive elements in l.
To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], we need to find all positive elements in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] is [5, 3, 9, 123, 1].
