The function generate_integers takes two integers a and b as input and returns a list of integers from a to b (inclusive) that are divisible by 2.
To determine the output of executing the function generate_integers on the input (17, 89), we need to generate a list of integers from 17 to 89 (inclusive) that are divisible by 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function generate_integers on the input (17, 89) is [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100].
