The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [127, 97, 8192] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through the length of the list (since ( len(lst) = 3 ).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - `lst[i]` is 127.
    - `lst[i] > maxx` is true.
    - `isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - `maxx` is updated to 127.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - `lst[i]` is 97.
    - `lst[i] > maxx` is false.
    - `isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - `maxx` is not updated.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - `lst[i]` is 8192.
    - `lst[i] > maxx` is false.
    - `isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - `maxx` is not updated.
