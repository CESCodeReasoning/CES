The function `median` is called with ( l = [8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7] ).
The function `sorted` is called with ( l = [8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7] ).
The function `sorted` sorts the list in ascending order.
The function `sorted` returns the sorted list, which is now [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 9].
The function `median` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 9] ).
The function `median` calculates the median of the list.
The list has an even number of elements, so the median is the average of the two middle elements.
The function `median` returns the median, which is now ( 7 + 8 ) / 2 = 7.5.
Therefore, the final output of the function `median([8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7])` is 7.5.
