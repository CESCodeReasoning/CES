The function concatenate takes a list of strings as input and returns the concatenation of all the strings in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function concatenate on the input ['x', 'y', 'z'], we need to concatenate the strings 'x', 'y', and 'z'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function concatenate on the input ['x', 'y', 'z'] is 'xyz'.
