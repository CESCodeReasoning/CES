The function incr_list takes a list l as input and returns a new list that contains the elements of l incremented by 1.
To determine the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [], we need to increment the elements of [] by 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [] is [1, 2, 3].
