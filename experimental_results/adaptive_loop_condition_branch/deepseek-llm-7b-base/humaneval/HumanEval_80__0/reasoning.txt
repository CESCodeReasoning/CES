The function `is_happy` is called with ( s = "aabb" ).
Inside the function, a variable `s` is initialized to "aabb".
The function checks if the length of `s` is less than 3.
If the length is less than 3, the function returns False.
Otherwise, the function loops through the characters in `s` from index 0 to index 2.
For each character, the function checks if the character is equal to the character at index 1 or index 2.
If the character is equal to the character at index 1 or index 2, the function returns False.
Otherwise, the function returns True.
Therefore, the function returns True for the input "aabb".
