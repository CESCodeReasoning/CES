The function `longest` is called with ( strings = ["a", "b", "c"] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxlen` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of the first string is 1, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The length of the second string is 2, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The length of the third string is 3, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The length of the first string is 1, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 1.
Iteration 5:
    -The length of the second string is 2, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 2.
Iteration 6:
    -The length of the third string is 3, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 3.
Iteration 7:
    -The length of the first string is 1, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 1.
Iteration 8:
    -The length of the second string is 2, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 2.
Iteration 9:
    -The length of the third string is 3, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 3.
Iteration 10:
    -The length of the first string is 1, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 1.
Iteration 11:
    -The length of the second string is 2, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 2.
Iteration 12:
    -The length of the third string is 3, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 3.
Iteration 13:
    -The length of the first string is 1, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 1.
Iteration 14:
    -The length of the second string is 2, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 2.
Iteration 15:
    -The length of the third string is 3, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 3.
Iteration 16:
    -The length of the first string is 1, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 1.
Iteration 17:
    -The length of the second string is 2, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 2.
Iteration 18:
    -The length of the third string is 3, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 3.
Iteration 19:
    -The length of the first string is 1, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 1.
Iteration 20:
    -The length of the second string is 2, which is greater than the current value of `maxlen`, so `maxlen` is updated to 2.
Iteration 21:
    -The length of the third string is 3
