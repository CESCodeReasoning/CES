The function `is_prime` is called with (n = 10 ).
Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to 2.
The loop iterates from 2 to 10 (since `range(2, n)`= [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] ).
First Iteration (i = 2):
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 2 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 3 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 4 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 5 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 6 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 7 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 8 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 9 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 10 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 11 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 12 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 13 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 14 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 15 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 16 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 17 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 18 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 19 = 0.

    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 23 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 24 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 25 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 26 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 27 = 0.
    `n % i` evaluates to 0 since 10 % 28 = 0.
