The function `triangle_area` is called with ( a = 3, b = 4, c = 5 ).
The condition `a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a` is checked.
Since the sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side, this condition is not satisfied for the given inputs.
Therefore, the if branch is not taken and the else branch is executed.
The semi-perimeter `s` of the triangle is calculated as `(a + b + c)/2`.
The area of the triangle is calculated using Heron's formula `(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5`.
The area is then rounded to 2 decimal places using the `round` function.
Therefore, the final output of the function `triangle_area(3, 4, 5)` is 6.0.
