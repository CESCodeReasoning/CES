The function `can_arrange` is called with ( arr = [4,8,5,7,3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The loop iterates through the array from the second element to the end.
First Iteration (i = 1):
    - arr[i] < arr[i - 1] when arr[1]=8 and arr[0]=4
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - arr[i] < arr[i - 1] when arr[2]=5 and arr[1]=8
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true. The branch is taken.
    - `ind = i` updates `ind` to 2 ( 2 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - arr[i] < arr[i - 1] when arr[3]=7 and arr[2]=5
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    - arr[i] < arr[i - 1] when arr[4]=3 and arr[3]=7
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true. The branch is taken.
    - `ind = i` updates `ind` to 4 ( 4 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is now 4.
