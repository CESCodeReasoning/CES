The function `can_arrange` is called with ( arr = [1,2,4,3,5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The loop iterates through the array.
First Iteration (i = 1):
    - arr[i]=2, arr[i-1]=1. The condition `arr[i]<arr[i-1]` is false. The branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - arr[i]=4, arr[i-1]=2. The condition `arr[i]<arr[i-1]` is false. The branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - arr[i]=3, arr[i-1]=4. The condition `arr[i]<arr[i-1]` is true. The branch is taken.
    - `ind` is updated to 3.
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    - arr[i]=5, arr[i-1]=3. The condition `arr[i]<arr[i-1]` is false. The branch is not taken.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is now 3.
