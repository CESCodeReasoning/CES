For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.
### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *


def anti_shuffle(s):
    return ' '.join([''.join(sorted(list(i))) for i in s.split(' ')])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
anti_shuffle('')
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input and returns a new string where each word in the input string is sorted alphabetically.

To determine the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input '', we need to split the input string into words, sort each word alphabetically, and then join the sorted words back together with a space in between each word.

Since the input string is empty, there are no words to sort, so the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input '' is ''.

The function anti_shuffle uses the built-in Python functions sorted, split, and join. The sorted function sorts the characters in a string alphabetically, the split function splits a string into a list of words, and the join function joins a list of strings into a single string with a specified delimiter.

The function anti_shuffle also uses list comprehension, which is a concise way to create lists in Python. In this case, it's used to create a list of sorted words.

The function anti_shuffle uses the typing module to specify the type of its input and output. The input is a string and the output is also a string.
