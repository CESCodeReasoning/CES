The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input and returns a new string where each word in the input string is sorted alphabetically.

To determine the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input '', we need to split the input string into words, sort each word alphabetically, and then join the sorted words back together with a space in between each word.

Since the input string is empty, there are no words to sort, so the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input '' is ''.

The function anti_shuffle uses the built-in Python functions sorted, split, and join. The sorted function sorts the characters in a string alphabetically, the split function splits a string into a list of words, and the join function joins a list of strings into a single string with a specified delimiter.

The function anti_shuffle also uses list comprehension, which is a concise way to create lists in Python. In this case, it's used to create a list of sorted words.

The function anti_shuffle uses the typing module to specify the type of its input and output. The input is a string and the output is also a string.
