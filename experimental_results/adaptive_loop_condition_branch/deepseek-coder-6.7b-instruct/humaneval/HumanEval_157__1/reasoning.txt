The function `right_angle_triangle` takes three arguments: a, b, and c. It checks if any of the three conditions is true:

1. The square of the hypotenuse (the longest side of the triangle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This is the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

2. The square of the first side (a) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (b and c).

3. The square of the second side (b) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and c).

4. The square of the third side (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b).

If any of these conditions is true, it means that the given sides can form a right-angled triangle.

To determine the output of executing the function `right_angle_triangle` on the input (1, 1, 1), we need to check if any of the three conditions is true.

The squares of the sides are (1, 1, 1), so the conditions are:

1. 1^2 = 1 + 1^2 is False
2. 1^2 = 1 + 1^2 is False
3. 1^2 = 1 + 1^2 is False

Since none of the conditions are true, the output of executing the function `right_angle_triangle` on the input (1, 1, 1) is False.
