### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *
def find_max(words):
    return sorted(words, key = lambda x: (-len(set(x)), x))[0]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
find_max(["name", "of", "string"])
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function find_max takes a list of words as input and returns the word with the maximum length that contains unique characters.

The function uses the sorted function to sort the words in the list. The key for the sorted function is a lambda function that returns a tuple (-len(set(x)), x). The tuple contains two elements: the negative length of the set of characters in the word (to ensure that words with more unique characters are placed first), and the word itself (to ensure that words with the same number of unique characters are sorted lexicographically).

The sorted function returns a list of the words in the order they would be sorted. The first element of this list is the word with the maximum length that contains unique characters.

To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "of", "string"], we need to sort the words in the list based on the criteria specified above.

The words "name", "of", and "string" have unique characters: "name" has 4 unique characters ("n", "a", "m", "e"), "of" has 2 unique characters ("o", "f"), and "string" has 6 unique characters ("s", "t", "r", "i", "n", "g"). Therefore, the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "of", "string"] is "string".

The word "string" has the maximum number of unique characters (6) and is lexicographically the smallest among the words with this number of unique characters.

Therefore, the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "of", "string"] is "string".

[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"string"
[/OUTPUT]
