The function find_closest_elements(numbers) takes a list of floating point numbers as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by idx in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
The function checks if the current pair of elements are closer than the previously found closest pair. If it is, it updates the closest pair and the distance.
