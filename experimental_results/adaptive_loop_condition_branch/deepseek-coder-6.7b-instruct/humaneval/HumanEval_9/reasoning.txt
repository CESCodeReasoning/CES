The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [3,2,3,100,3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to `None` and an empty list `result` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    - `running_max` is `None`, so `running_max` is set to the first number in the list, which is 3. The list `result` is updated to [3].
Iteration 2:
    - `running_max` is 3, and the second number in the list is 2. Since 2 is not greater than 3, `running_max` remains 3. The list `result` is updated to [3, 3].
Iteration 3:
    - `running_max` is 3, and the third number in the list is 3. Since 3 is greater than 3, `running_max` is updated to 3. The list `result` is updated to [3, 3, 3].
Iteration 4:
    - `running_max` is 3, and the fourth number in the list is 100. Since 100 is greater than 3, `running_max` is updated to 100. The list `result` is updated to [3, 3, 3, 100].
Iteration 5:
    - `running_max` is 100, and the fifth number in the list is 3. Since 3 is not greater than 100, `running_max` remains 100. The list `result` is updated to [3, 3, 3, 100, 100].

Therefore, the final output of the function `rolling_max([3,2,3,100,3])` is [3, 3, 3, 100, 100].
