The function `special_factorial` is called with (n = 7).
Inside the function, two variables `fact_i` and `special_fact` are initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 1 through 7 (since (n = 7)).

First Iteration (i = 1):
    fact_i *= i results in fact_i = 1 (1 * 1 = 1).
    special_fact *= fact_i results in special_fact = 1 (1 * 1 = 1).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    fact_i *= i results in fact_i = 2 (1 * 2 = 2).
    special_fact *= fact_i results in special_fact = 2 (1 * 2 = 2).
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    fact_i *= i results in fact_i = 6 (2 * 3 = 6).
    special_fact *= fact_i results in special_fact = 12 (2 * 6 = 12).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    fact_i *= i results in fact_i = 24 (6 * 4 = 24).
    special_fact *= fact_i results in special_fact = 288 (12 * 24 = 288).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5):
    fact_i *= i results in fact_i = 120 (24 * 5 = 120).
    special_fact *= fact_i results in special_fact = 3600 (288 * 120 = 3600).
Sixth Iteration (i = 6):
    fact_i *= i results in fact_i = 720 (120 * 6 = 720).
    special_fact *= fact_i results in special_fact = 252000 (3600 * 720 = 252000).
Seventh Iteration (i = 7):
    fact_i *= i results in fact_i = 5040 (720 * 7 = 5040).
    special_fact *= fact_i results in special_fact = 15120000 (252000 * 5040 = 15120000).

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `special_fact`, which is now 15120000.

[ANSWER]
def special_factorial(n):
    fact_i = 1
    special_fact = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1): ## [STATE]i=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][/STATE][STATE]range(1, (n + 1))=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][/STATE][STATE](n + 1)=[8][/STATE]
        fact_i *= i
        special_fact *= fact_i
    return special_fact
[/ANSWER]
