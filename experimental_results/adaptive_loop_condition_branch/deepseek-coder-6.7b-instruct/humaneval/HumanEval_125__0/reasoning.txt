The function `split_words` is called with ( txt = "" ).
The condition `" " in txt` is False, so the first branch is not taken.
The condition `"," in txt` is also False, so the second branch is not taken.
The else branch is taken. The function returns the length of the list of lowercase letters with even ASCII values in the string.

Therefore, the final output of the function `split_words("")` is 0.

[ANSWER]
def split_words(txt):
    if " " in txt: ## [CONDITION](" " in txt)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return txt.split()
    elif "," in txt: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return txt.replace(',', ' ').split()
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return len([i for i in txt if i.islower() and ord(i) % 2 == 0])
