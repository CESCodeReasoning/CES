The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'xywzx' ).
The length of the string is 5.

Iteration 1:
    - The characters at positions 0 and 4 are 'x' and 'x', which are the same, so the condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is False.
Iteration 2:
    - The characters at positions 1 and 3 are 'y' and 'z', which are not the same, so the condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is True, and the function returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_palindrome('xywzx')` is False.
