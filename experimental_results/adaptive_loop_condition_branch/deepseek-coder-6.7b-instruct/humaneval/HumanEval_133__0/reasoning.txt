The function `sum_squares` is called with (lst = [1,3,5,7]).
Inside the function, a variable `squared` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`.

First Iteration (i = 1):
    math.ceil(i) = 1
    1**2 = 1
    squared = 0 + 1 = 1
Second Iteration (i = 3):
    math.ceil(i) = 3
    3**2 = 9
    squared = 1 + 9 = 10
Third Iteration (i = 5):
    math.ceil(i) = 5
    5**2 = 25
    squared = 10 + 25 = 35
Fourth Iteration (i = 7):
    math.ceil(i) = 7
    7**2 = 49
    squared = 35 + 49 = 84

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `squared`, which is now 84.

[ANSWER]
def sum_squares(lst):
    import math
    squared = 0
    for i in lst: ## [STATE]i=[1,3,5,7][/STATE][STATE]lst=[[1,3,5,7]][/STATE]
        squared += math.ceil(i)**2
    return squared
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
