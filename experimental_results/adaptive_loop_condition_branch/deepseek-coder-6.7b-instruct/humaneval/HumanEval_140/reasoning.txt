The function `fix_spaces` is called with ( text = "Example" ).
Inside the function, a variable `new_text` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates over each character in the input string.
For each character, it checks if it is a space. If it is, it increments the `end` variable. If it is not, it checks if the number of spaces between the current character and the previous one is greater than 2. If it is, it adds a "-" followed by the current character to `new_text`. If it is not, it adds the number of "-"s followed by the current character to `new_text`. The `start` and `end` variables are updated at the end of each iteration.
After the loop completes, it checks if the number of spaces between the last character and the previous one is greater than 2. If it is, it adds a "-" to `new_text`. If it is not, it adds the number of "-"s to `new_text`.
Finally, it returns the value of `new_text`, which is the input string with spaces replaced by "-"s or "_"s.
