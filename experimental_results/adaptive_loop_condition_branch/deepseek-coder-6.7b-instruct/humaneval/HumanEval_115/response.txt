### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *
import math
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    return sum([math.ceil(sum(arr)/capacity) for arr in grid])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1) 
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function max_fill takes a 2D list grid and an integer capacity as input. The function calculates the total number of rows that can be filled with the given capacity.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each row in the grid. For each row, it calculates the sum of the elements in the row and divides it by the capacity. The result is then rounded up to the nearest integer using the math.ceil function. This gives the number of containers that can be filled with the given capacity in the row.

The function then sums up these numbers for all rows in the grid to get the total number of containers that can be filled with the given capacity in the grid.

To determine the output of executing the function max_fill on the input [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]] and 1, we need to calculate the number of containers that can be filled with 1 in each row of the grid.

For the first row [0,0,1,0], the sum of the elements is 1, so the number of containers that can be filled with 1 in this row is 1 (math.ceil(1/1) = 1).

For the second row [0,1,0,0], the sum of the elements is 1, so the number of containers that can be filled with 1 in this row is 1 (math.ceil(1/1) = 1).

For the third row [1,1,1,1], the sum of the elements is 4, so the number of containers that can be filled with 1 in this row is 4 (math.ceil(4/1) = 4).

Therefore, the total number of containers that can be filled with 1 in the grid is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.

So, the output of executing the function max_fill on the input [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]] and 1 is 6.
