The function unique takes a list l as input and returns a new list that contains the unique elements of l.

To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input ['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd'], we need to:

1. Convert the list to a set. A set is a collection of unique elements. By converting the list to a set, we remove any duplicate elements.
2. Convert the set back to a list. Since the function is supposed to return a list, we need to convert the set back to a list.
3. Sort the list. Since the function is supposed to return a list that is sorted, we sort the list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input ['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd'] is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].

The function works by first removing duplicates, then sorting the list, and finally returning the sorted list of unique elements.
