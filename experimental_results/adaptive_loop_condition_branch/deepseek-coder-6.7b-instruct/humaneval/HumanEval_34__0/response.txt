### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *


def unique(l: list):
    return sorted(list(set(l)))
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
unique(['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd'])
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function unique takes a list l as input and returns a new list that contains the unique elements of l.

To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input ['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd'], we need to:

1. Convert the list to a set. A set is a collection of unique elements. By converting the list to a set, we remove any duplicate elements.
2. Convert the set back to a list. Since the function is supposed to return a list, we need to convert the set back to a list.
3. Sort the list. Since the function is supposed to return a list that is sorted, we sort the list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input ['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd'] is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].

The function works by first removing duplicates, then sorting the list, and finally returning the sorted list of unique elements.
