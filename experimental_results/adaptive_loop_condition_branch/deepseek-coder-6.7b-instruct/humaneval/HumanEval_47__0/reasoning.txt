The function `median` is called with a list `[8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7]`.
The list is sorted to `[1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 9]`.
The length of the list is 7, which is an odd number.
The condition `len(l) % 2 == 1` is true, so the if branch is taken.
The median is the middle element of the sorted list, which is at index `len(l) // 2`.
Since `len(l) // 2` is 7 // 2 = 3, the median is 7.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7])` is 7.
