The function `sort_numbers` takes a string of space-separated numbers in words as input and returns a string of the same numbers in words sorted in ascending order.

The function works by first splitting the input string into a list of words using the `split(' ')` function. This gives us a list of words.

Then, it filters out any empty strings from the list using a list comprehension. This is done because the `split(' ')` function can sometimes produce empty strings at the end of the list.

Next, it sorts the list of words using the `sorted` function. The `key` argument of the `sorted` function is a lambda function that maps each word to its corresponding numeric value from the `value_map` dictionary. This ensures that the words are sorted based on their numeric values, not their lexicographic order.

Finally, it joins the sorted list of words back into a string with spaces between the words using the `join` function.

To determine the output of executing the function `sort_numbers` on the input 'five zero four seven nine eight', we need to split the input string into words, filter out any empty strings, sort the words based on their numeric values, and then join the sorted words back into a string.

The output of executing the function `sort_numbers` on the input 'five zero four seven nine eight' is 'zero four five eight seven nine'.

This is because 'zero' is the smallest numeric value in the input string, 'four' is the second smallest, 'five' is the third smallest, and so on.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `sort_numbers` on the input 'five zero four seven nine eight' is 'zero four five eight seven nine'.
