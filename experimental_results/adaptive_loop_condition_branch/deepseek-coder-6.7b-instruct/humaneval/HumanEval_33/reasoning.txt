The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a new list where every third element is sorted.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to sort every third element in the list.

The list has three elements, so the third element is [2]. After sorting [2], the output is [2].

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 2].

The function list(l) is used to create a copy of the input list, so that the original list is not modified. The slice l[::3] is used to get every third element in the list, and the sorted function is used to sort these elements. The sorted elements are then assigned back to the corresponding positions in the list using l[::3] = sorted(l[::3]).

The tuple function is used to convert the list to a tuple, because the problem statement asks for a tuple as output.

The output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3] is (1, 2, 2), which is a tuple.
