The function `count_nums` is called with ( arr = [1] ).
The function `digits_sum` is defined inside `count_nums`. It calculates the sum of the digits of a number, taking into account whether the number is negative.
In the `count_nums` function, for each number in the input array, the `digits_sum` function is called. The result of this function is a list of sums of digits for each number in the array.
Then, the `filter` function is used to keep only the numbers that are greater than 0.
Finally, the `len` function is used to count the number of elements in the resulting list.

For the input [1], the `digits_sum` function is called for each number in the array. For 1, the `digits_sum` function returns 1 (since 1 is a single digit number).
Since 1 is greater than 0, it is included in the list.

Therefore, the final output of the function `count_nums([1])` is 1.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def count_nums(arr):
    def digits_sum(n):
        neg = 1
        if n < 0: ## [CONDITION](n < 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
            n, neg = -1 * n, -1
        n = [int(i) for i in str(n)]
        n[0] = n[0] * neg
        return sum(n)
    return len(list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, [digits_sum(i) for i in arr])))
