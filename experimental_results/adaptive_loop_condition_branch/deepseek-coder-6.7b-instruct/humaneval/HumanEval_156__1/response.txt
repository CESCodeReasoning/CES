### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]

[CODE]
def sum_up_to_n(n):
    total = 0
    current_number = 1
    while current_number <= n: ## [STATE]current_number=??[/STATE][STATE]n=??[/STATE]
        total += current_number
        current_number += 1
    return total
[/CODE]
[INPUT]
sum_up_to_n(5)
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function `sum_up_to_n` is called with ( n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( n = 5 )).
First Iteration (current_number = 1):
    - current_number <= 5 when current_number=1
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (current_number = 2):
    - current_number <= 5 when current_number=2
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 3 ( 1 + 2 = 3 ).
Third Iteration (current_number = 3)
    - current_number <= 5 when current_number=3
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 6 ( 3 + 3 = 6 ).
Fourth Iteration (current_number = 4)
    -current_number <= 5 when current_number=4
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 10 ( 6 + 4 = 10 ).
Fifth Iteration (current_number = 5)
    -   current_number <= 5 when current_number=5
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 15 ( 10 + 5 = 15 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `total`, which is now 15.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def sum_up_to_n(n):
    total = 0
    current_number = 1
    while current_number <= n: ## [STATE]current_number=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5][/STATE][STATE]n=[5][/STATE]
        total += current_number
        current_number += 1
    return total

[CODE]
def sum_elements(elements):
    total = 0
    while elements: ## [STATE]elements=??[/STATE]
        total += elements[-1]
        elements.pop()
    return total
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sum_elements([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function `sum_elements` is called with ( elements = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
First Iteration:
    - elements = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], elements[-1] = 50.
    -`total += elements[-1]` updates `total` to 50 ( 0 + 50 = 50 ).
Second Iteration:
    - elements = [10, 20, 30, 40], elements[-1] = 40.
    -`total += elements[-1]` updates `total` to 90 ( 50 + 40 = 90 ).
Third Iteration:
    - elements = [10, 20, 30], elements[-1] = 30.
    -`total += elements[-1]` updates `total` to 120 ( 90 + 30 = 120 ).
Fourth Iteration:
    - elements = [10, 20], elements[-1] = 20.
    -`total += elements[-1]` updates `total` to 140 ( 120 + 20 = 140 ).
Fifth Iteration:
    - elements = [10], elements[-1] = 10.
    -`total += elements[-1]` updates `total` to 150 ( 140 + 10 = 150 ).
elements is empty, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `total`, which is now 150.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def sum_elements(elements):
    total = 0
    while elements: ## [STATE]elements=[[10, 20, 30, 40, 50],[10, 20, 30, 40], [10, 20, 30], [10, 20], [10]][/STATE]
        total += elements[-1]
        elements.pop()
    return total

[/CODE]

[INPUT]
int_to_mini_roman(152)
[/INPUT]

### Response:
[REASONING]
The function `int_to_mini_roman` is called with ( number = 152 ).
Inside the function, there are two lists: `num` and `sym`. `num` contains the decimal values of the roman numerals and `sym` contains the corresponding roman numeral symbols.
The while loop iterates from the highest decimal value in `num` down to 0.
First Iteration (i = 12):
    - number // num[i] = 152 // 1000 = 1 (integer division), number % num[i] = 2.
    - The while loop iterates 1 times, adding "M" to `res`.
Second Iteration (i = 9):
    - number // num[i] = 2 // 900 = 0 (integer division), number % num[i] = 2.
    - The while loop does not iterate, so no "CM" is added to `res`.
Third Iteration (i = 8):
    - number // num[i] = 2 // 100 = 0 (integer division), number % num[i] = 2.
    - The while loop does not iterate, so no "C" is added to `res`.
Fourth Iteration (i = 5):
    - number // num[i] = 2 // 50 = 0 (integer division), number % num[i] = 2.
    - The while loop does not iterate, so no "L" is added to `res`.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - number // num[i] = 2 // 40 = 0 (integer division), number % num[i] = 2.
    - The while loop does not iterate, so no "XL" is added to `res`.
Sixth Iteration (i = 2):
    - number // num[i] = 2 // 10 = 0 (integer division), number % num[i] = 2.
    - The while loop does not iterate, so no "X" is added to `res`.
Seventh Iteration (i = 1):
    - number // num[i] = 2 // 4 = 0 (integer division), number % num[i] = 2.
    - The while loop does not iterate, so no "IV" is added to `res`.
Eighth Iteration (i = 0):
    - number // num[i] = 2 // 1 = 2 (integer division), number % num[i] = 0.
    - The while loop iterates 2 times, adding "I" to `res`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `res`, which is now "MMII".
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def int_to_mini_roman(number):
    num = [1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 40, 50, 90,
           100, 400, 500, 900, 1000]
    sym = ["I", "IV", "V", "IX", "X", "XL",
           "L", "XC", "C", "CD", "D", "CM", "M"]
    i = 12
    res = ''
    while number: ## [STATE]number=[152, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0][/STATE]
        div = number // num[i]
        number %= num[i]
        while div: ## [STATE]div=[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0][/STATE]
            res += sym[i]
            div -= 1
        i -= 1
    return res.lower()
