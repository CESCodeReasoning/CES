The function get_positive takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the positive integers from the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6], we need to filter out the negative numbers from the input list.

The positive numbers in the input list are 4, 5, and 6. So, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6] is [4, 5, 6].

The function get_positive does this by using a list comprehension to iterate over each element e in the input list. If e is greater than 0 (i.e., it is positive), it is included in the new list. If e is not greater than 0 (i.e., it is negative), it is not included in the new list.

The list comprehension [e for e in l if e > 0] generates a new list that includes only the elements of l that satisfy the condition e > 0.

Therefore, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6] is [4, 5, 6].

The output is a list of positive integers from the input list.
