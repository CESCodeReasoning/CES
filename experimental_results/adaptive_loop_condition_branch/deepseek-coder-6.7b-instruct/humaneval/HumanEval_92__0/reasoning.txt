The function `any_int` is called with ( x = 2, y = 1, z = 1 ).
All the inputs are integers, which satisfies (isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int)), the if branch is taken.
The condition `(x + y == z) or (x + z == y) or (y + z == x)` is True, which means the branch is taken.

Therefore, the final output of the function `any_int(2,1,1)` is True.
