The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if the current number is even.
If it is even, it calculates the factorial of the number and appends it to the list ret.
If it is not even, it calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to the current number and appends it to the list ret.
