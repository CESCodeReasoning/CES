### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *


def sort_array(arr):
    return sorted(sorted(arr), key=lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1'))
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sort_array([])
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function sort_array takes a list of integers as input and returns a sorted list. The list is sorted first by its natural order, and then by the number of 1s in the binary representation of each number.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [], we need to sort the list in ascending order first, and then sort the list based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each number.

Since the input list is empty, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [] is also an empty list.

The sorted function in Python sorts the elements of a list in ascending order by default. The key parameter of the sorted function can be used to specify a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the list. In this case, the lambda function bin(x)[2:].count('1') is used to extract the number of 1s in the binary representation of each number.

The bin function converts an integer number to a binary string, and the count method counts the number of occurrences of a substring in a string. In this case, it counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of each number.

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [] is [].

Note: The sorted function does not modify the original list, but returns a new sorted list. If you want to sort the original list, you can use the sort method instead of the sorted function.

[OUTPUT]
[]
[/OUTPUT]
