The function `numerical_letter_grade` is called with ( grades = [1.2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `letter_grade` is initialized as an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The GPA 1.2 is not equal to 4.0, so it falls into the first elif block.
    -The GPA is greater than 3.7, so it falls into the second elif block.
    -The GPA is not greater than 3.3, so it falls into the third elif block.
    -The GPA is not greater than 3.0, so it falls into the fourth elif block.
    -The GPA is not greater than 2.7, so it falls into the fifth elif block.
    -The GPA is not greater than 2.3, so it falls into the sixth elif block.
    -The GPA is not greater than 2.0, so it falls into the seventh elif block.
    -The GPA is not greater than 1.7, so it falls into the eighth elif block.
    -The GPA is not greater than 1.3, so it falls into the ninth elif block.
    -The GPA is not greater than 1.0, so it falls into the tenth elif block.
    -The GPA is not greater than 0.7, so it falls into the eleventh elif block.
    -The GPA is not greater than 0.0, so it falls into the last else block.
    -The letter grade for GPA 1.2 is "D".

Therefore, the final output of the function `numerical_letter_grade([1.2])` is ["D"].
