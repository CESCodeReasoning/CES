<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the Deepseek Coder model, developed by Deepseek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science. For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.
### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *


def add(lst):
    return sum([lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
add([4, 0, 6, 7])
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function add takes a list lst as input and returns the sum of all elements at odd indices in the list that are even.

To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 0, 6, 7], we need to sum all elements at odd indices in the list.

The elements at odd indices in the list are at positions 1, 3. The elements at these positions are 0 and 6.

Since 0 is an even number, it is included in the sum. However, 6 is not an even number, so it is not included in the sum.

Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 0, 6, 7] is 0.

[OUTPUT]
0
[/OUTPUT]
