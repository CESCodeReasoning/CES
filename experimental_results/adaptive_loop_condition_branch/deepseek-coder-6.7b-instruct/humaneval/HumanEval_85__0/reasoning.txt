The function add takes a list lst as input and returns the sum of all elements at odd indices in the list that are even.

To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 0, 6, 7], we need to sum all elements at odd indices in the list.

The elements at odd indices in the list are at positions 1, 3. The elements at these positions are 0 and 6.

Since 0 is an even number, it is included in the sum. However, 6 is not an even number, so it is not included in the sum.

Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 0, 6, 7] is 0.
