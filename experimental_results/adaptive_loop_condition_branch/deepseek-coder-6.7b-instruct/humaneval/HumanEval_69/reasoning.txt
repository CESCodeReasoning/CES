The function `search` is called with ( lst = [5, 5, 5, 5, 1] ).
Inside the function, a list `frq` is initialized with zeros to keep track of the frequency of each number in the list.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 5 is found in the list, so `frq[5]` becomes 4.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 5 is found again, so `frq[5]` becomes 5.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 5 is found again, so `frq[5]` becomes 6.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 5 is found again, so `frq[5]` becomes 7.
Iteration 5:
    -The number 1 is found in the list, so `frq[1]` becomes 1.

After the loop, the function then iterates over the `frq` list.

Iteration 1:
    -The number `frq[1]` is 1, which is less than 1, so the condition `frq[i] >= i` is not met.
Iteration 2:
    -The number `frq[2]` is 0, which is less than 2, so the condition `frq[i] >= i` is not met.
Iteration 3:
    -The number `frq[3]` is 0, which is less than 3, so the condition `frq[i] >= i` is not met.
Iteration 4:
    -The number `frq[4]` is 0, which is less than 4, so the condition `frq[i] >= i` is not met.
Iteration 5:
    -The number `frq[5]` is 7, which is greater than or equal to 5, so the condition `frq[i] >= i` is met.

Therefore, the function returns 5.

[ANSWER]
def search(lst):
    frq = [0] * (max(lst) + 1)
    for i in lst: ## [STATE]i=[5, 5, 5, 5, 1][/STATE][STATE]lst=[[5, 5, 5, 5, 1]][/STATE]
        frq[i] += 1;

    ans = -1
    for i in range(1, len(frq)): ## [STATE]i=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5][/STATE][STATE]range(1, len(frq))=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5][/STATE][STATE]len(frq)=[6][/STATE]
        if frq[i] >= i: ## [CONDITION](frq[i] >= i)=[False, False, False, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            ans = i
    
    return ans
