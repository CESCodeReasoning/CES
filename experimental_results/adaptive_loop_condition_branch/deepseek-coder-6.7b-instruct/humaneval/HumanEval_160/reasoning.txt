The function `do_algebra` is called with (operator = ['**', '*', '+'], operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]).
The `operand` list contains the numbers to be operated on. The `operator` list contains the operators to be applied.
The `expression` is initialized as the string representation of the first number in the `operand` list.
The `zip(operator, operand[1:])` creates a list of tuples where each tuple contains an operator and a number from the `operand` list.

The loop iterates over the `zip(operator, operand[1:])`.

First Iteration (oprt = '**', oprn = 3):
    The expression is updated to '2**3'
Second Iteration (oprt = '*', oprn = 4):
    The expression is updated to '2**3*4'
Third Iteration (oprt = '+', oprn = 5):
    The expression is updated to '2**3*4+5'

After the loop completes, the `eval` function is used to evaluate the expression and the result is returned.

The expression '2**3*4+5' equals 57 when evaluated.
