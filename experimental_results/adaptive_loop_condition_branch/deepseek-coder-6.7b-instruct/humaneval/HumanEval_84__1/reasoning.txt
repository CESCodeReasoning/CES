The function solve takes an integer N as input and returns a binary string.

The function works in the following steps:

1. Convert the integer N to a string.
2. Sum all the digits in the string.
3. Convert the sum to a binary string.
4. Remove the '0b' prefix from the binary string.

To determine the output of executing the function solve on the input 147, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert 147 to a string: "147"
2. Sum all the digits in the string: 1 + 4 + 7 = 12
3. Convert the sum to a binary string: "1100"
4. Remove the '0b' prefix from the binary string: "1100"

Therefore, the output of executing the function solve on the input 147 is "1100".
