The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "2020" ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '2' is in primes, so total becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '0' is not in primes, so total remains 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '2' is in primes, so total becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '0' is not in primes, so total remains 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `hex_key("2020")` is 2.
