The function `sort_even` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3] ).
First, it separates the even-indexed elements (0, 2) and odd-indexed elements (1) from the list `l`.
The even-indexed elements are [1, 3] and the odd-indexed elements are [2].
Then, it sorts the even-indexed elements.
After sorting, the even-indexed elements are [1, 3] and the odd-indexed elements are [2].
The function then iterates over the zipped list of even and odd elements.
For each pair of elements (e, o), it appends e and o to the list `ans`.
Finally, if the length of the even-indexed elements is greater than the length of the odd-indexed elements, it appends the last element of the even-indexed elements to the list `ans`.
In this case, the length of the even-indexed elements is 2 and the length of the odd-indexed elements is 1.
So, it appends the last element of the even-indexed elements (which is 3) to the list `ans`.
The function then returns the list `ans`.
