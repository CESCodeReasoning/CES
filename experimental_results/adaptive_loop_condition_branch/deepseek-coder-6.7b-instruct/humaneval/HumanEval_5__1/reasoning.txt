The function `intersperse` is called with ( numbers = [2, 2, 2], delimeter = 2 ).
The condition `not numbers` is False, so the if branch is not taken.
The for loop iterates over the elements in `numbers` except the last one.
In each iteration, it appends the current number and the delimeter to `result`.
After the loop, it appends the last number in `numbers` to `result`.
The function returns `result`.
