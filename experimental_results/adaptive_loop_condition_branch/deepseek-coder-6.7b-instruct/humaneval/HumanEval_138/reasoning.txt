The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and checks if it is an even number and if it is greater than or equal to 8.
To determine the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 4, we need to check if 4 is an even number and if it is greater than or equal to 8.

4 is an even number because it can be divided by 2 without a remainder.
However, 4 is not greater than or equal to 8 because 8 is the smallest multiple of 2 that is greater than 4.

Therefore, the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 4 is False.
