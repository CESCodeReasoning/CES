The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 144, b = 60 ).
Inside the function, a while loop is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers.

First Iteration:
    - b != 0, so the loop continues.
    - a = 60, b = 144 % 60 = 144.
    - a and b are updated to b and a % b respectively.
    - Now, a = 144, b = 60.

Second Iteration:
    - b != 0, so the loop continues.
    - a = 60, b = 144 % 60 = 0.
    - a and b are updated to b and a % b respectively.
    - Now, a = 0, b = 60.

The loop terminates because b is 0.

The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 60.

So, the greatest common divisor of 144 and 60 is 60.
