The function next_smallest takes a list lst as input and returns the second smallest element in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [], we need to find the second smallest element in the list.

The function first sorts the list in ascending order and removes duplicates by converting it to a set. If the length of the list is less than 2, it means there are less than 2 unique elements in the list, so the function returns None. If there are 2 or more unique elements in the list, the function returns the second element in the sorted list, which is the second smallest element in the original list.

Since the input [] is an empty list, there are no elements in it, so the function returns None.

Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [] is None.
