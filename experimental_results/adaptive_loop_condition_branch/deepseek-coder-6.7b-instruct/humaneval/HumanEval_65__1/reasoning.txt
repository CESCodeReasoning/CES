The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 12, shift = 1 ).
The function converts the integer `x` to a string `s`.
Then it checks if `shift` is greater than the length of `s`.
If `shift` is greater, it returns the reverse of `s`.
Otherwise, it returns a string that is a circular shift of `s` by `shift` places.

The circular shift of a string `s` by `shift` places means that the last `shift` characters of `s` are moved to the front of `s`, and the rest of `s` remains the same.

In this case, `x` is 12, which is converted to `s` as "12".
`shift` is 1.
Since `shift` is not greater than the length of `s`, the else branch is taken.

The circular shift of "12" by 1 place is "21".

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(12, 1)` is "21".
