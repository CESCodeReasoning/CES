The function `longest` is called with ( strings = ['x', 'y', 'z'] ).
The function checks if the list `strings` is empty.
Since the list is not empty, the condition `not strings` is False.
Therefore, the function proceeds to the next step.
The function calculates the maximum length of the strings in the list using the `max` function and the `len` function.
The maximum length is 1 (the length of 'x').
The function then iterates over the list of strings.
During the first iteration (s = 'x'), the length of 'x' is equal to the maximum length (1).
Therefore, the function returns 'x'.
