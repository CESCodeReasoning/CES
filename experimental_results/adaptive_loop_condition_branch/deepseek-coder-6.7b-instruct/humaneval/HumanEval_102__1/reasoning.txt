The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 33, y = 12354 ).
The first condition checks if `x` is greater than `y`. Since `x` is 33 and `y` is 12354, the first condition is not met.
The second condition checks if `y` is an even number. `y` is 12354, which is not an even number, so the second condition is not met.
The third condition checks if `x` is equal to `y`. Since `x` is not equal to `y`, the third condition is not met.
Finally, the function returns `y - 1`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(33, 12354)` is 12354 - 1 = 12353.
