The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The function iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
If the current number is even, it calculates the factorial of the number and appends it to the list ret.
If the current number is odd, it calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to the current number and appends it to the list ret.
