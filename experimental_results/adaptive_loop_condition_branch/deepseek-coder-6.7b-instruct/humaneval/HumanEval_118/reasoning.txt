The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "yogurt" ).
The function checks if the length of the word is less than 3. If it is, it returns an empty string.
If the length of the word is 3 or more, it iterates over the word from the end to the start.
For each character, it checks if the character is a vowel and if the characters before and after it are not vowels.
If it finds such a character, it returns it. If it doesn't find any, it returns an empty string.

In the word "yogurt", the character 'u' is a vowel and the characters before and after it are not vowels. So, it returns 'u'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `get_closest_vowel("yogurt")` is 'u'.

[ANSWER]
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    if len(word) < 3: ## [CONDITION](len(word) < 3)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return ""

    vowels = {"a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "A", "E", 'O', 'U', 'I'}
    for i in range(len(word)-2, 0, -1): ## [STATE]i=[4, 3, 2, 1][/STATE][STATE]range((len(word) - 2), 0, (- 1))=[2, 1, 0][/STATE][STATE](len(word) - 2)=[2][/STATE]
        if word[i] in vowels: ## [CONDITION](word[i] in vowels)=[True, True, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y, N, N][/BRANCH]
            if (word[i+1] not in vowels) and (word[i-1] not in vowels): ## [CONDITION]((word[i+1] not in vowels) and (word[i-1] not in vowels))=[(False, False), (False, False), (False, False), (False, False)][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N][/BRANCH]
                return word[i]
    return ""
