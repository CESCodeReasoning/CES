The function `sort_even` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3] ).
First, it separates the even and odd indexed elements into two lists `evens` and `odds`.
For the given list, `evens` will be [2] and `odds` will be [1, 3].
Then, it sorts the `evens` list.
After sorting, `evens` will be [2].
Then, it creates an empty list `ans` and iterates over the `evens` and `odds` lists simultaneously using the `zip` function.
For each iteration, it appends the even and odd element to `ans` in that order.
For the given list, the iteration will append [2, 1] to `ans`.
Finally, it checks if the length of `evens` is greater than the length of `odds`.
Since the lengths are equal in this case, the condition ( len(evens) > len(odds) ) is not satisfied, so the else branch is taken.
The function returns `ans` which is [2, 1].
