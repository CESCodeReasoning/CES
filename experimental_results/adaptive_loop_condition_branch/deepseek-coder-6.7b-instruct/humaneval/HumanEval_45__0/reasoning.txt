The function triangle_area calculates the area of a triangle given its base (a) and height (h). The formula for calculating the area of a triangle is base * height / 2.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (10, 8), we need to calculate 10 * 8 / 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (10, 8) is 40.0.
