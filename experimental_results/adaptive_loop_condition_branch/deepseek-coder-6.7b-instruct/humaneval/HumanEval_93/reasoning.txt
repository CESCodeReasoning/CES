The function encode takes a string message as input.

First, it defines a string vowels containing all the vowels in both lowercase and uppercase.

Then, it creates a dictionary vowels_replace where each vowel in the string vowels is mapped to its ASCII value plus 2. This is done using the built-in function dict and list comprehension.

Next, it converts the entire message to uppercase using the built-in method swapcase().

Finally, it returns a new string where each character in the message is replaced by its corresponding value in the dictionary vowels_replace if the character is a vowel, or by the character itself otherwise. This is done using a list comprehension.

To determine the output of executing the function encode on the input 'TEST', we first convert 'TEST' to uppercase using the swapcase() method, which gives us 'test'.

Then, we replace each vowel in 'test' with its ASCII value plus 2. The vowels are 'e' and 'a', so we replace them with 'g' and 'c' respectively.

Therefore, the output of executing the function encode on the input 'TEST' is 'gcvt'.
