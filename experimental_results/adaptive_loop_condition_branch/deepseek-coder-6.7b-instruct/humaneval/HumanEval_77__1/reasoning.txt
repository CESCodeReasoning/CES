The function iscube takes an integer a as input and checks if it is a perfect cube. A perfect cube is an integer that can be expressed as the cube of an integer.

To determine if a number is a perfect cube, we first take the absolute value of the number to handle negative inputs. Then, we cube the rounded version of the number's cube root. If this result is equal to the original number, then the number is a perfect cube.

To calculate the cube root of a number, we raise the number to the power of 1/3. We round this result to the nearest integer using the round function. This is because the cube root of a number is always a non-negative real number.

Finally, we square the rounded cube root to get the cube of the cube root. If this result is equal to the original number, then the number is a perfect cube.

To determine the output of executing the function iscube on the input 0, we first take the absolute value of 0 to get 0. Then, we calculate the cube root of 0, which is 0. We round this result to the nearest integer, which is still 0. We then square this result to get 0. Since 0 is equal to 0, the number 0 is a perfect cube.

Therefore, the output of executing the function iscube on the input 0 is True.
