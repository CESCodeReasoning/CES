The function `double_the_difference` takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the positive odd integers in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function `double_the_difference` on the input `[-10, -20, -30]`, we need to consider the following steps:

1. The function iterates over each element in the list.
2. For each element, it checks if the element is a positive odd integer (i > 0 and i % 2 != 0).
3. It also checks if the element does not contain a decimal point (i.e., it is an integer). This is done by converting the element to a string and checking if "." is not in the string.
4. If the element meets all these conditions, it is squared (i**2) and added to the sum.
5. The function returns the sum of these squared elements.

Since the input list contains negative numbers, they are not positive odd integers, so they are not included in the sum.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `double_the_difference` on the input `[-10, -20, -30]` is 0.
