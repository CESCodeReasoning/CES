The function triples_sum_to_zero(l) takes a list of integers as its parameter.
The outermost loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
The first inner loop starts from the current element and iterates through the remaining elements to compare it against the others.
The innermost loop starts from the current element in the second loop and iterates through the remaining elements to compare it against the others.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the second loop is 1, 2 and 3.
    - j=1: k in the innermost loop is 2 and 3.
    - j=2: k in the innermost loop is 3.
    - j=3: No more elements to compare in the innermost loop.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the second loop is 2 and 3.
    - j=2: k in the innermost loop is 3.
    - j=3: No more elements to compare in the innermost loop.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the second loop is 3.
    - j=3: No more elements to compare in the innermost loop.
Fourth Iteration (i=3):
    No more elements to compare in the second loop.
