The function `all_prefixes` is called with (string = 'WWW').
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized as an empty list.
`len(string)` = 3 since there are 3 characters in 'WWW'.
The loop iterates from 0 to 2 since `range(len(string))` = [0, 1, 2].

First Iteration (i = 0):
    string[:i + 1] = 'W'
    The function appends 'W' to the `result` list.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    string[:i + 1] = 'WW'
    The function appends 'WW' to the `result` list.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    string[:i + 1] = 'WWW'
    The function appends 'WWW' to the `result` list.

After the loop completes, the function returns the `result` list, which is now ['W', 'WW', 'WWW'].
