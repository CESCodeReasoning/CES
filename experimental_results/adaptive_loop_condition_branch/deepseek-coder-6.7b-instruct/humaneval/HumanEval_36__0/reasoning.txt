The function `fizz_buzz` is called with ( n = 100000 ).
Inside the function, a variable `ns` is initialized as an empty list.
The loop iterates from 0 through 99999 (since ( n = 100000 )).
For each iteration, it checks if the current number `i` is divisible by 11 or 13.
If it is, the number is appended to the `ns` list.
After the loop, the `ns` list is converted to a string `s`.
Then, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.
If the character `c` is '7', `ans` is incremented by 1.
Finally, the function returns the value of `ans`.
