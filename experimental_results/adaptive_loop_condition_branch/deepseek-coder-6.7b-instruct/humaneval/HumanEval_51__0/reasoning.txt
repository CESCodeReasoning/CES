The function remove_vowels takes a string text as input and returns a new string where all the vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) are removed.

To determine the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input '', we need to iterate over each character in the string and check if it is a vowel. If it is not a vowel, we add it to the new string.

Since the input string is empty, there are no characters to check, so the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input '' is ''.

The function remove_vowels uses a list comprehension to create a new list of characters that are not vowels. The join method is then used to convert this list back into a string.

The list comprehension works by iterating over each character in the input string, converting it to lowercase, and checking if it is not in the list of vowels. If the character is not a vowel, it is added to the new list. The join method then combines all the characters in the list into a single string.

The output of the function is an empty string, because there are no vowels in the input string.

The function remove_vowels uses the lower method to convert characters to lowercase before checking if they are vowels, so it works correctly even if the input string contains uppercase vowels.

The function remove_vowels uses the join method to convert the list of non-vowel characters back into a string, so it works correctly even if the input string contains non-alphabetic characters.
