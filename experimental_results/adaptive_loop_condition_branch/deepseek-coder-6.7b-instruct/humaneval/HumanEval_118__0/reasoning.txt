The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "full" ).
The function checks if the length of the word is less than 3. If it is, it returns an empty string.
If the length of the word is 3 or more, it iterates over the word in reverse order (from the end to the start).
For each character in the word, it checks if the character is a vowel.
If the character is a vowel and the characters before and after it are not vowels, it returns the character.
If no such character is found after checking all characters, it returns an empty string.

In the word "full", the character 'u' is a vowel and the characters before and after it are not vowels, so the function returns 'u'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `get_closest_vowel("full")` is 'u'.

[ANSWER]
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    if len(word) < 3: ## [CONDITION](len(word) < 3)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return ""

    vowels = {"a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "A", "E", 'O', 'U', 'I'}
    for i in range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1): ## [STATE]i=[3, 2, 1][/STATE][STATE]range((len(word) - 2), 0, (- 1))=[1, 0][/STATE][STATE](len(word) - 2)=[2][/STATE]
        if word[i] in vowels: ## [CONDITION](word[i] in vowels)=[True, True, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y, N][/BRANCH]
            if (word[i + 1] not in vowels) and (word[i - 1] not in vowels): ## [CONDITION]((word[i + 1] not in vowels) and (word[i - 1] not in vowels))=[(False, False), (False, False), (False, False)][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N][/BRANCH]
                return word[i]
    return ""
