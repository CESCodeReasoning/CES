The function sum_to_n takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of all integers from 0 to n (inclusive).
To determine the output of executing the function sum_to_n on the input 100, we need to calculate the sum of all integers from 0 to 100 (inclusive).

The sum of all integers from 0 to n can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2.

So, to calculate the sum of all integers from 0 to 100, we substitute n with 100 in the formula.

The calculation is as follows:

100*(100+1)/2 = 50*51/2 = 2550

Therefore, the output of executing the function sum_to_n on the input 100 is 2550.
