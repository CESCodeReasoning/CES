For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.
### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *


def sum_to_n(n: int):
    return sum(range(n + 1))
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sum_to_n(100)
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function sum_to_n takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of all integers from 0 to n (inclusive).
To determine the output of executing the function sum_to_n on the input 100, we need to calculate the sum of all integers from 0 to 100 (inclusive).

The sum of all integers from 0 to n can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2.

So, to calculate the sum of all integers from 0 to 100, we substitute n with 100 in the formula.

The calculation is as follows:

100*(100+1)/2 = 50*51/2 = 2550

Therefore, the output of executing the function sum_to_n on the input 100 is 2550.

[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
2550
[/OUTPUT]
