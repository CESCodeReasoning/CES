The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with ( paren_string = '()()((((()()((()))))()()()))' ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is a list to store the groups of parentheses, `current_string` is a list to store the current group of parentheses, and `current_depth` is a variable to track the depth of parentheses.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is found, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character ')' is found, so `current_depth` becomes 0, ')' is appended to `current_string`, and ''.join(current_string) is appended to `result`. `current_string` is then cleared.
