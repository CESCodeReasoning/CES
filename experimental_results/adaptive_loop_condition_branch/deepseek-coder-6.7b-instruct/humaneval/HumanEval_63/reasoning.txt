The function `fibfib` is called with ( n = 2 ).
The first condition `n == 0` is false, so it's not taken.
The second condition `n == 1` is false, so it's not taken.
The third condition `n == 2` is true, so the if branch is taken and the method returns 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fibfib(2)` is 1.
