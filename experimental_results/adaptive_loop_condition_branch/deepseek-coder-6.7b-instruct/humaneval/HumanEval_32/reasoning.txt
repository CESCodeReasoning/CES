The function `find_zero` is called with a list of coefficients for a polynomial equation. The function uses the bisection method to find the roots of the polynomial.

The bisection method works by repeatedly dividing the interval in which the root lies in half. The interval is chosen such that it contains a root. The interval is chosen such that the product of the function values at the endpoints of the interval is negative.

The function `poly` is used to evaluate the polynomial at a given point.

The initial interval is chosen such that the function values at the endpoints of the interval have opposite signs. The interval is chosen such that the function values at the endpoints of the interval have opposite signs.

The loop continues until the width of the interval is less than a small positive number (1e-10).

In each iteration of the loop, the center of the interval is calculated and the function value at the center is checked. If the function value at the center is zero or very close to zero, then the center is returned as the root. If the function value at the center is positive, then the root is in the interval from the beginning of the interval to the center. If the function value at the center is negative, then the root is in the interval from the center to the end of the interval.

The loop continues until the width of the interval is less than a small positive number (1e-10).

The function returns the value of the root, which is the value of `center`.

The function `find_zero` returns the value of `center`.
