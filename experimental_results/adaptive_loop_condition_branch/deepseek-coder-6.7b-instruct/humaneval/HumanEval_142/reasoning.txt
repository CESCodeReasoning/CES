The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [1,2,3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized as an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The index `i` is 0, which is not divisible by 3 or 4, so the element at index `i` (which is 1) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 2:
    -The index `i` is 1, which is not divisible by 3 or 4, so the element at index `i` (which is 2) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 3:
    -The index `i` is 2, which is not divisible by 3 or 4, so the element at index `i` (which is 3) is appended to `result`.

Since the list `lst` only contains 3 elements, the function returns the sum of the elements in `result`, which is 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_squares([1,2,3])` is 14.
