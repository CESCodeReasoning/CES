The function `intersperse` is called with ( numbers = [5, 6, 3, 2], delimeter = 8 ).
The condition `not numbers` is False, so the if branch is not taken.
The for loop iterates over all elements in `numbers` except the last one.
In each iteration, the current number `n` and `delimeter` are appended to `result`.
After the loop, the last number in `numbers` is appended to `result`.
The function returns `result`.
