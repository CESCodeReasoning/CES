The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = '0' ).
The length of the string '0' is 1.
The condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is false (since 1 is not equal to 0 or 1).
The condition `l == 0` is false (since 1 is not equal to 0).
The condition `l == 1` is true (since 1 is equal to 1).
The branch is taken (since the condition `l == 1` is true).
The function returns False.
