The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of these numbers.

The mean absolute deviation is calculated as follows:
1. First, calculate the mean of the numbers. This is done by summing up all the numbers in the list and dividing by the number of elements in the list.
2. Then, for each number in the list, calculate its deviation from the mean (which is the absolute difference between the number and the mean).
3. Sum up all these deviations and divide by the number of elements in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function `mean_absolute_deviation` on the input `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`, we need to follow these steps:
1. Calculate the mean of the numbers, which is `(1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0 + 4.0) / 4 = 2.5`.
2. For each number in the list, calculate its deviation from the mean. The deviations are `abs(1.0 - 2.5) = 2.5`, `abs(2.0 - 2.5) = 0.5`, `abs(3.0 - 2.5) = 0.5`, and `abs(4.0 - 2.5) = 1.5`.
3. Sum up these deviations, which is `2.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.5 = 5`.
4. Divide this sum by the number of elements in the list, which is `5 / 4 = 1.25`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `mean_absolute_deviation` on the input `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]` is `1.25`.
