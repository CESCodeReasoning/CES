### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *


def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    smallest = list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, lst))
    largest = list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, lst))
    return (max(smallest) if smallest else None,
            min(largest) if largest else None)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
largest_smallest_integers([-1, -3, -5, -6])
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function `largest_smallest_integers` takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest and smallest negative integers in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function `largest_smallest_integers` on the input `[-1, -3, -5, -6]`, we need to filter out the negative integers from the list and find the maximum and minimum among them.

1. First, we filter out the negative integers from the list using a lambda function that returns True for negative integers and False for non-negative integers. The result is a list of negative integers.
2. We then find the maximum among these negative integers using the `max` function.
3. We return this maximum as the first element of the tuple.
4. We repeat the process for the list of non-negative integers. We find the minimum among these non-negative integers and return this as the second element of the tuple.

Since the input list only contains negative integers, the maximum of the negative integers will be the smallest negative integer and the minimum of the non-negative integers will be `None`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `largest_smallest_integers` on the input `[-1, -3, -5, -6]` is `(-1, None)`.

The function `largest_smallest_integers` returns `None` if the input list is empty or contains only non-negative integers.
