The function `intersperse` is called with an empty list (numbers = []) and a delimeter (delimeter = 7).
The condition `not numbers` is True, so the if branch is taken.
In the if branch, the function returns an empty list as the output.

Therefore, the final output of the function `intersperse([], 7)` is [].
