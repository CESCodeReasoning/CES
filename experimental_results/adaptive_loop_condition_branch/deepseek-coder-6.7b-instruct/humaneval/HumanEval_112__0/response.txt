For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.
### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *


def reverse_delete(s, c):
    s = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in c])
    return (s, s[::-1] == s)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
reverse_delete("abcdedcba","v")
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function reverse_delete takes a string s and a string c as inputs. The function should return a tuple where the first element is the string s with all characters in c removed, and the second element is a boolean indicating whether the resulting string is the same when reversed.

In the given input, s is "abcdedcba" and c is "v". The string c contains the character "v", which is present in the string s. Therefore, we need to remove all occurrences of "v" from the string s.

After removing all occurrences of "v" from the string s, we get "abcdecba". Comparing this string with its reverse "abcdcba", we find that they are not the same. Therefore, the function reverse_delete should return ("abcdecba", False).

Therefore, the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcdedcba","v" is ("abcdecba", False).

[OUTPUT]
("abcdecba", False)
[/OUTPUT]
