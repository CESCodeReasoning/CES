The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [1, -1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is added to `s`, resulting in `s = 1`.
    -Since `s` is not less than 0, `max_sum` is updated to `max(s, max_sum)`, which is `max_sum = 1`.
Iteration 2:
    -The number -1 is subtracted from `s`, resulting in `s = -1`.
    -Since `s` is less than 0, `s` is reset to 0.
    -Since `max_sum` is not updated in this iteration, `max_sum` remains 1.

Since `max_sum` is not 0, the function returns `-max_sum`, which is `-1`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([1, -1])` is -1.

[ANSWER]
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    max_sum = 0
    s = 0
    for num in nums: ## [STATE]num=[1, -1][/STATE][STATE]nums=[[1, -1]][/STATE]
        s += -num
        if (s < 0): ## [CONDITION](s < 0)=[False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, Y][/BRANCH]
            s = 0
        max_sum = max(s, max_sum)
    if max_sum == 0: ## [CONDITION](max_sum == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        max_sum = max(-i for i in nums)
    min_sum = -max_sum
    return min_sum
