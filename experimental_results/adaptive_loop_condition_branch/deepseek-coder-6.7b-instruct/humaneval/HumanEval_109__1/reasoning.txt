The function `move_one_ball` is called with ( arr = [3, 5, 4, 1, 2] ).
First, it checks if the length of the array is 0. If it is, it returns True because there are no balls to move.
If the array is not empty, it sorts the array and creates a new array `my_arr` by shifting the minimum value to the front.
Then, it iterates over the array and checks if each element in `my_arr` is equal to the corresponding element in the sorted array.
If there is any element in `my_arr` that is not equal to the corresponding element in the sorted array, it returns False.
If all elements in `my_arr` are equal to the corresponding elements in the sorted array, it returns True.
