The function filter_by_substring takes a list of strings and a substring as input. It returns a new list that contains only the strings from the input list that contain the substring.

To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx', we need to filter the list to only include strings that contain the substring 'xxx'.

The strings 'xxx', 'xxxAAA', and 'xxx' contain the substring 'xxx', so they are included in the output list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx' is ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'].
