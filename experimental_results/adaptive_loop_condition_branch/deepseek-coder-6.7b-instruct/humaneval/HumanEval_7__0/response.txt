For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.
### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *


def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if substring in x]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
filter_by_substring(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx')
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function filter_by_substring takes a list of strings and a substring as input. It returns a new list that contains only the strings from the input list that contain the substring.

To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx', we need to filter the list to only include strings that contain the substring 'xxx'.

The strings 'xxx', 'xxxAAA', and 'xxx' contain the substring 'xxx', so they are included in the output list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx' is ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'].
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']
[/OUTPUT]
