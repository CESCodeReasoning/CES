The function iscube takes an integer a as input and checks if it is a perfect cube. A perfect cube is an integer that can be expressed as the cube of an integer.

To determine if a number is a perfect cube, we first take the absolute value of the number to handle negative inputs. Then, we raise the absolute value to the power of 1/3 and round it to the nearest integer. This gives us the cube root of the number. We then square this cube root and check if it is equal to the original number. If it is, then the number is a perfect cube and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function iscube on the input 1, we first take the absolute value of 1 to get 1. Then, we raise 1 to the power of 1/3 and round it to the nearest integer, which is 1. We then square this 1, which gives us 1. Finally, we check if 1 is equal to 1. Since they are equal, the function returns True, indicating that 1 is a perfect cube.

Therefore, the output of executing the function iscube on the input 1 is True.
