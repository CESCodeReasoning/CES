The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a string `txt` as input and checks if the last character of the string is a letter.

To do this, the function splits the string `txt` into a list of words using the `split(' ')` method. The `[-1]` index is used to get the last element of the list.

Then, it checks if the length of the last word is 1. If it is not, it means that the last word contains more than one character, so it returns `False`.

Next, it checks if the ASCII value of the last character of the last word is between 97 and 122 (inclusive). These values correspond to the ASCII values of lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'. If the ASCII value of the last character is not within this range, it means that the last character is not a lowercase letter, so it returns `False`.

If both conditions are met, it returns `True`, indicating that the last character of the string is a lowercase letter.

For the input `"apple"`, the last word is `"apple"`, which has a length of 1. The ASCII value of the last character `"e"` is 101, which is not within the range 97 to 122, so the function returns `False`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` on the input `"apple"` is `False`.
