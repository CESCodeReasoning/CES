The function select_words(s, n) takes a string and an integer as its parameters.
The string is split into words using the split() method.
For each word in the string, the function counts the number of consonants in the word.
If the number of consonants in the word is equal to the integer n, the word is appended to the result list.
The function returns the result list.

In the given input "Mary had a little lamb", 4:
- The string is split into words: ["Mary", "had", "a", "little", "lamb"]
- For each word, count the number of consonants:
    - "Mary" has 2 consonants
    - "had" has 1 consonant
    - "a" has 1 consonant
    - "little" has 3 consonants
    - "lamb" has 2 consonants
- The words with 4 consonants are "Mary" and "lamb", so the result list is ["Mary", "lamb"]

The function returns the list ["Mary", "lamb"].
