The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "abcCd" ).
The condition `s == ""` is false, so the else branch is taken.
The function `ord` returns the ASCII value of a character. If the character is uppercase, its ASCII value is added to the sum. If the character is lowercase, 0 is added to the sum.
The character 'a' is lowercase, so its ASCII value (97) is not added to the sum.
The character 'b' is lowercase, so its ASCII value (98) is not added to the sum.
The character 'c' is lowercase, so its ASCII value (99) is not added to the sum.
The character 'C' is uppercase, so its ASCII value (67) is added to the sum.
The character 'd' is lowercase, so its ASCII value (100) is not added to the sum.
The sum of the ASCII values is 163.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digitSum("abcCd")` is 163.
