The function `count_nums` is called with ( arr = [1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5] ).
The function `count_nums` has an inner function `digits_sum` which calculates the sum of the digits of a number.
The `digits_sum` function is called for each element in the input array.
The `filter` function is used to filter out the positive sums from the array returned by the `digits_sum` function.
The `len` function is used to count the number of positive sums.

For example, for the number 1, the sum of its digits is 1.
For the number -2, the sum of its digits is 2 (since we multiply the first digit by -1 to handle negative numbers).
For the number 3, the sum of its digits is 3.
For the number 4, the sum of its digits is 4.
For the number 5, the sum of its digits is 5.

The positive sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
So, the function `count_nums` returns the length of this list, which is 5.

Therefore, the final output of the function `count_nums([1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5])` is 5.
