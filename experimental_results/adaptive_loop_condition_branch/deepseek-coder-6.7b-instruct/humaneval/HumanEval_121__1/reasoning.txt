The function solution takes a list lst as input and returns the sum of all elements in the list that are at an even index and are odd numbers.

To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32], we need to sum all the elements in the list that are at an even index and are odd numbers.

The elements at even indices in the list are 30, 23. The elements at odd indices in the list are 13, 32.

The elements at even indices that are odd numbers are 13, 32.

Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32] is 45 (13 + 32).

The function works by iterating over the list and checking the index of each element. If the index is even (idx % 2 == 0) and the element is odd (x % 2 == 1), it adds the element to the sum.

The sum function adds up all the elements in the list that meet these conditions, and the result is returned by the function.

The sum function is a built-in Python function that adds up all the elements in a list. The expression [x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx % 2 == 0 and x % 2 == 1] is a list comprehension, which is a compact way of creating a new list by performing an operation on each element in an existing list.

The enumerate function is a built-in Python function that returns a tuple for each element in the list, where the first element is the index of the element and the second element is the element itself.

The idx % 2 == 0 condition checks if the index is even, and x % 2 == 1 checks if the element is odd.

The sum function adds up all the elements in the list that meet these conditions, and the result is returned by the function.
