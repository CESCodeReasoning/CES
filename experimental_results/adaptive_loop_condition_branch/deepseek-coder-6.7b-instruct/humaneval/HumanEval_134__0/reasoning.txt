The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a string `txt` as input and checks if the last character of the string is a letter.

To do this, the function splits the string `txt` into a list of words using the `split(' ')` method. The `[-1]` index is used to get the last element of the list.

Then, it checks if the length of the last word is 1. If the length is not 1, it means that the last word contains more than one character, so it returns `False`.

Next, it checks if the ASCII value of the last character of the last word is between 97 and 122 (inclusive). If the ASCII value is not in this range, it means that the last character is not a lowercase letter, so it returns `False`.

If both conditions are met, it returns `True`, indicating that the last character of the string is a lowercase letter.

For the input `"apple pi e "`, the last word is "e", which has a length of 1 and an ASCII value of 101, which is not in the range 97-122. Therefore, the output of executing the function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` on the input `"apple pi e "` is `False`.
