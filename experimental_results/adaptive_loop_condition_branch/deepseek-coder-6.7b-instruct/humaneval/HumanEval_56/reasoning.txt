The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "<<><>>" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '<' is found, so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '<' is found, so depth becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '>' is found, so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '>' is found, so depth becomes 0.

Since the depth is 0 at the end of the string, the function returns True.

[ANSWER]
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets: ## [STATE]brackets=["<", "<", ">", ">"][/STATE]
        if b == "<": ## [CONDITION](b == "<")=[True, True, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y, N, N][/BRANCH]
            depth += 1
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N, N, Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0: ## [CONDITION](depth < 0)=[False, False, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            return False
    return depth == 0
