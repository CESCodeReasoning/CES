### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *
def add(lst):
    return sum([lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i]%2 == 0])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
add([4, 88]) 
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function add takes a list lst as input and returns the sum of all elements at odd indices in the list that are even.

To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88], we need to sum all elements at odd indices in the list.

The list has two elements, so the indices are 0 and 1. The element at index 0 is 4, which is at an odd index, and it is even, so it is included in the sum.

The element at index 1 is 88, which is at an odd index, and it is even, so it is included in the sum.

Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88] is 92.

The function uses list comprehension to generate a list of elements at odd indices in the input list that are even. The sum function is then used to calculate the sum of this list.

The function uses the range function with a step of 2 to generate the indices of the elements to include in the sum. The if condition checks if the element at the current index is even.

The function uses the modulus operator (%) to check if the element is even. If the element is divisible by 2 with no remainder, it is even.

The function uses the sum function to calculate the sum of the elements in the list.

The function uses the len function to get the number of elements in the list.

The function uses the square brackets [] to access elements in the list by their indices.

The function uses the colon : to specify a range of indices to include in the sum. The range function generates the indices from 1 to the number of elements in the list, with a step of 2.

The function uses the for loop to iterate over the elements at the odd indices in the list.

The function uses the return statement to return the sum of the elements at odd indices in the list that are even.

The function uses the typing module to specify the type of the input and output.

The function uses the sum function to calculate the sum of the elements in the list.
