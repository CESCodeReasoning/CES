The function remove_vowels takes a string text as input and returns a new string where all the vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) are removed.

To determine the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input 'fedcba', we need to iterate over each character in the string 'fedcba'. If the character is not a vowel (i.e., it is not in the list ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]), we include it in the new string. If the character is a vowel, we skip it.

So, the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input 'fedcba' is 'fedcba', because all the vowels are removed.

The function remove_vowels uses a list comprehension to create a new string. The expression [s for s in text if s.lower() not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]] generates a list of characters in text that are not vowels. The "".join() method then concatenates these characters into a new string.

The lower() method is used to ensure that the function works correctly even if the input string contains uppercase vowels.

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the function needs to iterate over each character in the string once.
