The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 3, b = 7 ).
Inside the function, a while loop is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers.

In the first iteration:
    - b is not zero ( b = 7 ), so the loop continues.
    - a % b = 3 ( the remainder of 3 divided by 7 ), and b becomes 3.
    - a becomes 7.

In the second iteration:
    - b is not zero ( b = 3 ), so the loop continues.
    - a % b = 1 ( the remainder of 7 divided by 3 ), and b becomes 1.
    - a becomes 3.

In the third iteration:
    - b is zero ( b = 1 ), so the loop terminates.

The function returns the value of `a`, which is now the GCD of the original numbers.

So, the GCD of 3 and 7 is 1.
