The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and checks if it is an even number and if it is greater than or equal to 8.
To determine the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 13, we need to check if 13 is an even number and if it is greater than or equal to 8.
13 is not an even number because it is not divisible by 2. Therefore, the first condition is False.
13 is not greater than or equal to 8, so the second condition is also False.
Therefore, the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 13 is False.
