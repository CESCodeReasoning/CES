The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [0, 10, 20, 1000000] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `s` becomes `0 - 0 = 0`.
    - `max_sum` remains 0 as `0` is greater than `0`.
Iteration 2:
    - `s` becomes `0 - 10 = -10`.
    - `max_sum` remains 0 as `-10` is not greater than `0`.
Iteration 3:
    - `s` becomes `-10 - 20 = -30`.
    - `max_sum` remains 0 as `-30` is not greater than `0`.
Iteration 4:
    - `s` becomes `-30 - 1000000 = -1000030`.
    - `max_sum` updates to `-1000030` as `-1000030` is greater than `0`.

Since `max_sum` is not 0, the function returns `-max_sum` which is `-1000030`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([0, 10, 20, 1000000])` is `-1000030`.

[ANSWER]
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    max_sum = 0
    s = 0
    for num in nums: ## [STATE]num=[-10, 20, -30, -1000030][/STATE][STATE]nums=[-10, 20, -30, -1000000][/STATE]
        s += -num
        if (s < 0): ## [CONDITION](s < 0)=[False, False, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            s = 0
        max_sum = max(s, max_sum)
    if max_sum == 0: ## [CONDITION](max_sum == 0)=[True, False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, N, N, N][/BRANCH]
        max_sum = max(-i for i in nums)
    min_sum = -max_sum
    return min_sum
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
-1000030
