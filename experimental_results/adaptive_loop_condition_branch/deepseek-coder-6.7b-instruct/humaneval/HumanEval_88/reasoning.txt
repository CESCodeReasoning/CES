The function sort_array takes an array as input and returns a sorted version of the array. If the array is empty, it returns an empty array.

The sorted function sorts the array in ascending order. The reverse parameter of the sorted function is set to True if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, and False otherwise.

The sum of the first and last elements of the array is calculated by adding the first element (array[0]) and the last element (array[-1]) of the array.

The modulo operator (%) is used to determine if the sum is even or odd. If the sum is even, the array is sorted in descending order (reverse=True), and if the sum is odd, the array is sorted in ascending order (reverse=False).

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [15, 42, 87, 32 ,11, 0] is [87, 42, 32, 15, 11, 0] because the sum of the first and last elements of the array is odd.

The array is sorted in ascending order because the sum of the first and last elements of the array is odd.

The sorted array is obtained by sorting the array in ascending order.

The first element of the array is 15, the last element of the array is 0, and the sum of these two elements is 15 (an odd number).

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [15, 42, 87, 32 ,11, 0] is [87, 42, 32, 15, 11, 0].
