The function sort_array takes a list of integers as input and returns a sorted version of the list. The list is sorted first by its natural order, and then by the number of 1's in the binary representation of each number.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [3,6,44,12,32,5], we need to sort the list first by its natural order, which results in [3, 5, 6, 12, 32, 44]. Then, we sort the list again by the number of 1's in the binary representation of each number.

The binary representation of 3 is '11', which has 2 1's. The binary representation of 5 is '101', which has 2 1's. The binary representation of 6 is '110', which has 2 1's. The binary representation of 12 is '1100', which has 2 1's. The binary representation of 32 is '10000', which has 4 1's. The binary representation of 44 is '101100', which has 3 1's.

So, after sorting by the number of 1's in the binary representation, the list becomes [6, 3, 12, 5, 32, 44].

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [3,6,44,12,32,5] is [6, 3, 12, 5, 32, 44].
