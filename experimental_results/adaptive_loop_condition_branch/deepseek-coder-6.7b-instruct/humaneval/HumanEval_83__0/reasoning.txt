The function `starts_one_ends` is called with ( n = 4 ).
The condition `n == 1` is false, so the function proceeds to the return statement.
The return statement calculates `18 * (10 ** (n - 2))`, where `n` is 4.
Substituting `n` with 4, we get `18 * (10 ** (4 - 2))`.
Simplifying this expression, we get `18 * (10 ** 2)`.
Evaluating this expression, we get `18 * 100`.
Therefore, the final output of the function `starts_one_ends(4)` is 1800.
