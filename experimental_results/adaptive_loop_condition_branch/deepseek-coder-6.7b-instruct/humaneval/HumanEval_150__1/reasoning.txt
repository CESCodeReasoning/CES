The function `x_or_y` is called with ( n = 91, x = 56, y = 129 ).
The first condition checks if n is equal to 1. Since 91 is not equal to 1, it proceeds to the next condition.
The second condition checks if n is divisible by any number in the range from 2 to n. Since 91 is not divisible by any of these numbers, it returns y, which is 129.
