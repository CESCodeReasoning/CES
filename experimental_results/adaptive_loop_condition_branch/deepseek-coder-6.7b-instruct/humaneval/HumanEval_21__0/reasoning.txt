The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is rescaled to the range [0, 1] by subtracting the minimum number in the input list from each number and then dividing by the range of the input list (maximum number - minimum number).

To determine the output of executing the function `rescale_to_unit` on the input `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]`, we first need to find the minimum and maximum numbers in the input list.

The minimum number in the input list is 1.0 and the maximum number is 5.0.

Then, for each number in the input list, we subtract the minimum number from the number and divide by the range of the input list (which is 5.0 - 1.0 = 4.0).

So, the output of executing the function `rescale_to_unit` on the input `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]` is `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`.

This means that each number in the input list has been rescaled to the range [0, 1] by subtracting the minimum number and dividing by the range of the input list.

Therefore, the output of the function `rescale_to_unit` on the input `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]` is `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`.
