The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and checks if it is an even number and if it is greater than or equal to 8.
To determine the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 6, we need to check if 6 is an even number and if it is greater than or equal to 8.
6 is an even number because it can be divided by 2 without a remainder.
However, 6 is not greater than or equal to 8, so the function returns False.
