The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the unique elements from the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5], we need to follow these steps:

1. Import the collections module, which provides a Counter class for counting elements in a list.
2. Create a Counter object c from the input list. The Counter object c stores the count of each element in the list. For example, c[1] is 1, c[2] is 2, and so on.
3. Create a new list by iterating over the input list and checking the count of each element in the Counter object c. If the count is 1 (i.e., the element is unique), it is included in the new list. If the count is more than 1 (i.e., the element is a duplicate), it is not included in the new list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5] is [1, 4, 5], which contains only the unique elements from the input list.

Note: The order of elements in the output list may not match the order of elements in the input list.
