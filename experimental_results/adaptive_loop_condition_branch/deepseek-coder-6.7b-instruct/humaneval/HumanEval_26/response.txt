For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.
### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    import collections
    c = collections.Counter(numbers)
    return [n for n in numbers if c[n] <= 1]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) 
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the unique elements from the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5], we need to follow these steps:

1. Import the collections module, which provides a Counter class for counting elements in a list.
2. Create a Counter object c from the input list. The Counter object c stores the count of each element in the list. For example, c[1] is 1, c[2] is 2, and so on.
3. Create a new list by iterating over the input list and checking the count of each element in the Counter object c. If the count is 1 (i.e., the element is unique), it is included in the new list. If the count is more than 1 (i.e., the element is a duplicate), it is not included in the new list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5] is [1, 4, 5], which contains only the unique elements from the input list.

Note: The order of elements in the output list may not match the order of elements in the input list.

[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[1, 4, 5]
[/OUTPUT]
