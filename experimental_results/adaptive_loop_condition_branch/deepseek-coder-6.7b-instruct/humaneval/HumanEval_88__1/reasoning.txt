The function sort_array takes an array as input and returns a sorted version of the array.

The function first checks if the length of the array is 0. If it is, it returns an empty array.

If the array is not empty, it calculates the result of adding the first and last elements of the array and taking the modulus of 2. If the result is 0, it means that the sum of the first and last elements is even, so the array should be sorted in reverse order. If the result is 1, it means that the sum of the first and last elements is odd, so the array should be sorted in normal order.

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [5] is [5].

The function is expected to return the array sorted in ascending order if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is odd, and in descending order if the sum of the first and last elements is even. However, the input array [5] only contains one element, so the function returns the array as it is.

The first and last elements of the array are both 5, and their sum is 10, which is even. Therefore, the array should be sorted in descending order. But since the array only contains one element, it is already sorted.

So, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [5] is [5].
