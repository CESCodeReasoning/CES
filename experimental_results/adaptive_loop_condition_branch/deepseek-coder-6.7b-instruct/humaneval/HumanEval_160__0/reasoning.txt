The function `do_algebra` is called with (operator = ['//', '*'], operand = [7, 3, 4]).
The function takes two arguments: a list of operators and a list of operands.
The first operator is '//', which is the integer division operator. The second operator is '*', which is the multiplication operator.
The first operand is 7, the second operand is 3, and the third operand is 4.

The function constructs an expression by iterating over the operators and operands.
The expression starts with the first operand (7).
For each pair of an operator and an operand, the function appends the operator and the operand to the expression.

First iteration (oprt = '//', oprn = 3):
    expression = '7' + '//' + '3' results in expression = '7//3'
Second iteration (oprt = '*', oprn = 4):
    expression = '7//3' + '*' + '4' results in expression = '7//3*4'

After the loop completes, the function evaluates the expression and returns the result.

The expression '7//3*4' is evaluated as follows:
    7 // 3 = 2 (integer division)
    2 * 4 = 8
So, the function returns 8.
