The function triangle_area calculates the area of a triangle given its base (a) and height (h). The formula for calculating the area of a triangle is base * height / 2.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (2, 2), we need to substitute the base and height values into the formula.
Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (2, 2) is 2 * 2 / 2 = 2.0.
