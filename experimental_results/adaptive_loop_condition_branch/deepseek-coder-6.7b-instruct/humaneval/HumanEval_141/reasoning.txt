The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = "example.txt" ).
The function splits the file_name by '.' and stores the result in `lst`.
The first condition checks if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2. If it's not, it means the file name does not have a file extension or has more than one.
The second condition checks if the file extension is not in the list `suf`.
The third and fourth conditions check if the file name (without extension) is empty or does not start with an alphabet character respectively.
The last condition counts the number of digits in the file name and checks if it's more than 3.
If any of the conditions are met, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

In this case, the file name "example.txt" is valid because it has a valid file extension, starts with an alphabet character, and does not have more than 3 digits in the name.
So, the final output of the function `file_name_check("example.txt")` is 'Yes'.
