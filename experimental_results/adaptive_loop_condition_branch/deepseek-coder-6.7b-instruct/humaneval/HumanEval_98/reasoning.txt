The function `count_upper` is called with ( s = 'aBCdEf' ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character at index 0 in the string 'aBCdEf' is 'a', which is not an uppercase vowel.
Iteration 2:
    -The character at index 2 in the string 'aBCdEf' is 'C', which is not an uppercase vowel.
Iteration 3:
    -The character at index 4 in the string 'aBCdEf' is 'E', which is an uppercase vowel.
    -So, `count` becomes 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `count_upper('aBCdEf')` is 1.

[ANSWER]
def count_upper(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(0,len(s),2): ## [STATE]i=[0, 2, 4][/STATE][STATE]range(0, len(s), 2)=[0, 2, 4][/STATE][STATE]len(s)=[6][/STATE]
        if s[i] in "AEIOU": ## [CONDITION](s[i] in "AEIOU")=[False, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            count += 1
    return count
