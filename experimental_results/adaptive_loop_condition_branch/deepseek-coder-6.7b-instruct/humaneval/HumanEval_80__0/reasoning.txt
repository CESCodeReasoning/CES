The function `is_happy` is called with ( s = "aabb" ).
The length of the string is 4, which is greater than 3, so the first condition `len(s) < 3` is False.

The loop iterates over the string, comparing each character with the next two characters.
Iteration 1:
    -The characters 'a' and 'a' are the same, so the function returns False.
Iteration 2:
    -The characters 'a' and 'b' are not the same, so the function continues.
Iteration 3:
    -The characters 'b' and 'b' are the same, so the function returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_happy("aabb")` is False.
