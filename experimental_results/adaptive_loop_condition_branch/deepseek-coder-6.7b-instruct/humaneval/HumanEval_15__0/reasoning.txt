The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string.

The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of integers from 0 to n (inclusive). The range function generates the sequence of numbers from 0 to n, and the str function converts each number to a string.

The join method is then used to concatenate all the strings in the list, separated by a space.

So, if we call string_sequence with the input 3, the function will return the string "0 1 2 3".

This is because the range function generates the sequence [0, 1, 2, 3], which is then converted to strings and joined together with spaces in between.

Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3 is "0 1 2 3".
