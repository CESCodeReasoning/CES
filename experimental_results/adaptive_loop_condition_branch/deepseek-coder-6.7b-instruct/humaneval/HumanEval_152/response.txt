### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *
def compare(game,guess):
    return [abs(x-y) for x,y in zip(game,guess)]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2])
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function compare takes two lists, game and guess, as input. It returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements in the two lists.

To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input ([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]), we need to calculate the absolute differences between corresponding elements in the two lists.

The first element in the game list is 1 and the first element in the guess list is 1. The absolute difference between these two numbers is 0.

The second element in the game list is 2 and the second element in the guess list is 2. The absolute difference between these two numbers is also 0.

The third element in the game list is 3 and the third element in the guess list is 3. The absolute difference between these two numbers is also 0.

The fourth element in the game list is 4 and the fourth element in the guess list is 4. The absolute difference between these two numbers is also 0.

The fifth element in the game list is 5 and the fifth element in the guess list is 2. The absolute difference between these two numbers is 3.

The sixth element in the game list is 1 and the sixth element in the guess list is -2. The absolute difference between these two numbers is 3.

Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input ([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) is [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3].

This is achieved by using the zip function to iterate over the two lists simultaneously, and the abs function to calculate the absolute difference between corresponding elements. The result is a list of these differences.
