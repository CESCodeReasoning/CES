The function parse_music takes a string music_string as input and returns a list of integers. The string is split into a list of words using the split() function, with each word being a note in the music.

The note_map dictionary maps the notes to their corresponding integer values. The keys in the dictionary are the notes and the values are the corresponding integer values.

The function then iterates over each word in the list. If the word is in the note_map dictionary, it adds the corresponding integer value to the output list. If the word is not in the note_map dictionary, it ignores it.

To determine the output of executing the function parse_music on the input '.| .| .| .|', we need to map each note to its corresponding integer value and return a list of these integer values.

The notes in the input string are '.|', '.|', '.|', and '.|'. The corresponding integer values are 1, 1, 1, and 1.

Therefore, the output of executing the function parse_music on the input '.| .| .| .|' is [1, 1, 1, 1].

The output list contains the integer values of the notes in the music string, in the order they appear.

The output list [1, 1, 1, 1] represents the music string '.| .| .| .|', where each '.' represents a quarter note and '|' represents a bar line.

The function parse_music is useful for parsing music notation into a format that can be used for further processing or display.
