The function add_elements takes a list of integers arr and an integer k as input. The function returns the sum of the first k elements in the list, where each element is less than or equal to 2 digits long.

To determine the output of executing the function add_elements on the input ([11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9], 4), we need to sum the first 4 elements in the list. The first 4 elements are 11, 21, 3, and 90. The number 11 and 21 are 2 digits long, so they are included in the sum. The number 3 is 1 digit long, so it is included in the sum. The number 90 is 2 digits long, so it is included in the sum. The number 5 is not included in the sum because it is 1 digit long.

Therefore, the output of executing the function add_elements on the input ([11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9], 4) is 11 + 21 + 3 + 90 = 137.
