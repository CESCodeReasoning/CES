The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with ( paren_string = '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())' ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list, which will store the separate groups of parentheses. Another variable `current_string` is initialized to an empty list, which will store the current group of parentheses. A variable `current_depth` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the current depth of parentheses.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is found, so `current_depth` is incremented to 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is found, so `current_depth` is incremented to 2 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ')' is found, so `current_depth` is decremented to 1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is found, so `current_depth` is decremented to 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 5:
    -The `current_depth` is 0, so the current group of parentheses is appended to `result` and `current_string` is cleared.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ' ' is found, so it is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character '(' is found, so `current_depth` is incremented to 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 8:
    -The character '(' is found, so `current_depth` is incremented to 2 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 9:
    -The character ')' is found, so `current_depth` is decremented to 1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 10:
    -The character ')' is found, so `current_depth` is decremented to 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 11:
    -The `current_depth` is 0, so the current group of parentheses is appended to `result` and `current_string` is cleared.
Iteration 12:
    -The character '(' is found, so `current_depth` is incremented to 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 13:
    -The character '(' is found, so `current_depth` is incremented to 2 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 14:
    -The character ')' is found, so `current_depth` is decremented to 1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 15:
    -The character ')' is found, so `current_depth` is decremented to 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 16:
    -The character ')' is found, so `current_depth` is decremented to -1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 17:
    -The character '(' is found, so `current_depth` is incremented to 0 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 18:
    -The character '(' is found, so `current_depth` is incremented to 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 19:
    -The character ')' is found, so `current_depth` is decremented to 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 20:
    -The `current_depth` is 0, so the current group of parentheses is appended to `result` and `current_string` is cleared.

The final output of the function `separate_paren_groups('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')` is ['()', '()', '', '()()'].
