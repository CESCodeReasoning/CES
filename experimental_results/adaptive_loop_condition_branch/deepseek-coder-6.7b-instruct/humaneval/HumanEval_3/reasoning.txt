The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -3, 1, 2, -3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The operation 1 is added to the balance, resulting in a balance of 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The operation 2 is added to the balance, resulting in a balance of 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The operation -3 is subtracted from the balance, resulting in a balance of 0.
Iteration 4:
    -The operation 1 is added to the balance, resulting in a balance of 1.
Iteration 5:
    -The operation 2 is added to the balance, resulting in a balance of 3.
Iteration 6:
    -The operation -3 is subtracted from the balance, resulting in a balance of 0.

Since the balance never goes below zero, the function returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `below_zero([1, 2, -3, 1, 2, -3])` is False.
