The function `total_match` is called with ( lst1 = ['4'], lst2 = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'] ).
First, we calculate the length of each list in `lst1` and `lst2`.
In `lst1`, there is only one string '4', so its length is 1.
In `lst2`, there are 5 strings, so its length is 5.
After calculating the lengths, we compare them.
Since 1 (length of lst1) is less than or equal to 5 (length of lst2), the condition ( l1 <= l2 ) is satisfied.
Therefore, the function returns `lst1` as the output.
