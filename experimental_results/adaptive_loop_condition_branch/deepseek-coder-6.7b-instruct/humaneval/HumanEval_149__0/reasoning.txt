The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["d", "dcba", "abcd", "a"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order.

Iteration 1:
    -The string 'a' has length 1, which is not even. So it is not appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 2:
    -The string 'd' has length 1, which is not even. So it is not appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The string 'dcba' has length 4, which is even. So it is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 4:
    -The string 'abcd' has length 4, which is even. So it is appended to `new_lst`.

Finally, `new_lst` is sorted by length and returned.
