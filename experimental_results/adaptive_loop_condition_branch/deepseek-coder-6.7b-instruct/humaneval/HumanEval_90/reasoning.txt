The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input and returns the second smallest unique number in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we need to sort the unique numbers in the list in ascending order and then return the second element of the sorted list.

First, we remove duplicates from the list by converting it to a set. Then, we sort the set in ascending order to get [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

Since the length of the list is 5, there are at least two elements in the list, so we return the second element of the sorted list, which is 2.

Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 2.
