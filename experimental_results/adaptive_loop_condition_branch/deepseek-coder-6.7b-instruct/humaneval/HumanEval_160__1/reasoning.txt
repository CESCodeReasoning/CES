The function `do_algebra` is called with (operator = ['+', '*', '-'], operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]).
The function takes two arguments: a list of operators and a list of operands.
The expression is initially set to the first operand (2).
Then, for each operator and operand pair, the operator is appended to the expression followed by the operand.
Finally, the expression is evaluated and the result is returned.

First Iteration (oprt = '+', oprn = 3):
    expression = '2' + '+' + '3' results in expression = '2+3'
Second Iteration (oprt = '*', oprn = 4):
    expression = '2+3' + '*' + '4' results in expression = '2+3*4'
Third Iteration (oprt = '-', oprn = 5):
    expression = '2+3*4' + '-' + '5' results in expression = '2+3*4-5'

The expression '2+3*4-5' is evaluated to 11.
