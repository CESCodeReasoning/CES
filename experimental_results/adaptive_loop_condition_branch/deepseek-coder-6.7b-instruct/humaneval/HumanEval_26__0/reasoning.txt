The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the unique elements from the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 4], we need to count the occurrence of each number in the list and keep only the numbers that occur exactly once.

The input list [1, 2, 3, 4] contains four unique numbers: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] is [1, 2, 3, 4].

The function works by using the collections.Counter class to count the occurrence of each number in the list. The Counter object c stores the count of each number in the list. The list comprehension [n for n in numbers if c[n] <= 1] generates a new list that contains only the numbers from the input list that occur exactly once.

The Counter object c is a dictionary-like object that stores the count of each number in the list. The keys of the Counter object are the unique numbers in the list and the values are the counts of the numbers. The condition c[n] <= 1 in the list comprehension checks if the count of each number is less than or equal to 1, which means the number occurs exactly once in the list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] is [1, 2, 3, 4], which means that the function has successfully removed all duplicates from the input list.
