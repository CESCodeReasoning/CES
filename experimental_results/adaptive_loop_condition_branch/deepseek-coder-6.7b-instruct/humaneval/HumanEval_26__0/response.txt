### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *


def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    import collections
    c = collections.Counter(numbers)
    return [n for n in numbers if c[n] <= 1]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 4])
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the unique elements from the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 4], we need to count the occurrence of each number in the list and keep only the numbers that occur exactly once.

The input list [1, 2, 3, 4] contains four unique numbers: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] is [1, 2, 3, 4].

The function works by using the collections.Counter class to count the occurrence of each number in the list. The Counter object c stores the count of each number in the list. The list comprehension [n for n in numbers if c[n] <= 1] generates a new list that contains only the numbers from the input list that occur exactly once.

The Counter object c is a dictionary-like object that stores the count of each number in the list. The keys of the Counter object are the unique numbers in the list and the values are the counts of the numbers. The condition c[n] <= 1 in the list comprehension checks if the count of each number is less than or equal to 1, which means the number occurs exactly once in the list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] is [1, 2, 3, 4], which means that the function has successfully removed all duplicates from the input list.
