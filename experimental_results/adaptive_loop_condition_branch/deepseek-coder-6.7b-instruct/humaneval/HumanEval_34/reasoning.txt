The function unique takes a list l as input and returns a new list that contains the unique elements of l in ascending order.

To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], we need to:

1. Convert the list to a set. A set is a collection of unique elements. By converting the list to a set, we remove any duplicate elements.
2. Convert the set back to a list.
3. Sort the list in ascending order.

Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123] is [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123].

This is because a set does not maintain the order of its elements, and sorting a list in ascending order will arrange the elements in ascending order.

The final output is [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123], which is a list of the unique elements from the input list in ascending order.
