The function reverse_delete takes a string s and a string c as inputs. The function should return a tuple where the first element is the string s with all characters in c removed, and the second element is a boolean indicating whether the resulting string is the same when reversed.

In the given input, "mamma" is the string s and "mia" is the string c.

The function first removes all characters in c from s by creating a new string that includes only the characters in s that are not in c. This is done using a list comprehension, which creates a new list of characters in s that are not in c. The join function is then used to convert this list back into a string.

The second part of the function checks whether the resulting string is the same when reversed. This is done by comparing the reversed string (obtained by slicing the string with a step of -1) to the original string. If they are the same, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Therefore, the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "mamma", "mia" is ("amma", False).

The string "amma" is the result of removing the characters "m" and "i" from the string "mamma". The string "amma" is not the same as its reverse, so the function returns False.
