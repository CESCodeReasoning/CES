The function `intersection` is called with two intervals as arguments.
The function `is_prime` checks if a number is prime.
The function `intersection` calculates the length of the intersection of the two intervals.
If the length is greater than 0 and the length is a prime number, the function returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

In the given example, the function `intersection` is called with the intervals (1, 2) and (2, 3).
The length of the intersection is 1 (the maximum of the two start points and the minimum of the two end points).
The function `is_prime` checks if 1 is a prime number.
Since 1 is not a prime number, the function `intersection` returns "NO".

Therefore, the final output of the function `intersection((1, 2), (2, 3))` is "NO".
