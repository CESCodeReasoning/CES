The function `order_by_points` is called with an empty list (nums = []).
The function `order_by_points` returns the sorted list of numbers based on the sum of their digits.
The helper function `digits_sum` calculates the sum of the digits of a number.
The helper function `digits_sum` is called for each number in the list `nums`.
Since the input list is empty, the helper function `digits_sum` is not called and the function `order_by_points` returns an empty list.

Therefore, the final output of the function `order_by_points([])` is [].
