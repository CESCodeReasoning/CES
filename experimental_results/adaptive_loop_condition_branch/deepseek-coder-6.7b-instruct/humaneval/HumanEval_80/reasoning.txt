The function `is_happy` is called with ( s = "a" ).
The condition `len(s) < 3` is checked.
Since the length of the string "a" is 1, which is less than 3, the condition is True.
The branch is taken and the function returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_happy("a")` is False.
