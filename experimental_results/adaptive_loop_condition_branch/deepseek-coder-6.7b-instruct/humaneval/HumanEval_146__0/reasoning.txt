The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is not greater than 10, so the loop continues.
    -The number 1 does not have an odd digit at the beginning or the end, so the loop continues.
    -The count remains 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `specialFilter([1])` is 0.
