The function triangle_area calculates the area of a triangle given its base (a) and height (h). The formula for calculating the area of a triangle is base * height / 2.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (5, 3), we need to substitute the base and height into the formula.
Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (5, 3) is 5 * 3 / 2 = 7.5.
