The function add takes a list lst as input and returns the sum of all elements at odd indices in the list that are even.

To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 4, 6, 8], we need to sum all elements at odd indices in the list that are even.

The elements at odd indices in the list are at indices 1, 3. The elements at these indices are 4 and 6.

Since 4 and 6 are both even, the sum of these elements is 10.

Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 4, 6, 8] is 10.
