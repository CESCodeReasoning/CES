The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['3',"11111111"]).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized as an empty list.
The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`.

First Iteration (arr = '3'):
    The sum of odd numbers in '3' is 1 (since '3' is an odd number).
    The string "the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput." is appended to `res`.
Second Iteration (arr = "11111111"):
    The sum of odd numbers in "11111111" is 8 (since all the digits are odd).
    The string "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput." is appended to `res`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `res`, which is now ['the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.', 'the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput.'].
