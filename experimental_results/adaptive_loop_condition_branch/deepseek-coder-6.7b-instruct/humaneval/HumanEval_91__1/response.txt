### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *


def is_bored(S):
    import re
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)
    return sum(sentence[0:2] == 'I ' for sentence in sentences)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
is_bored("I love It !")
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function `is_bored` takes a string `S` as input and returns the number of sentences in `S` that start with "I ".

To determine the output of executing the function `is_bored` on the input "I love It !", we need to split the string `S` into sentences using the `re.split` function. The `re.split` function splits the string `S` at each occurrence of a period, question mark, or exclamation point followed by zero or more whitespace characters.

The `sum` function then counts the number of sentences in `S` that start with "I ". This is done by iterating over each sentence in `S` and checking if the first two characters of the sentence are "I ". If they are, the sentence is counted.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `is_bored` on the input "I love It !" is 1. There is one sentence in the input string that starts with "I ".

The string "I love It !" is split into the sentences ["I love It !"]. The first two characters of the first sentence "I love It !" are "I " and "I " does not equal "I ", so the function `is_bored` returns 0.

The string "I love It !" is split into the sentences ["I love It !"]. The first two characters of the first sentence "I love It !" are "I " and "I " does equal "I ", so the function `is_bored` returns 1.
