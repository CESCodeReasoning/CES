The function `is_bored` takes a string `S` as input and returns the number of sentences in `S` that start with "I ".

To determine the output of executing the function `is_bored` on the input "I love It !", we need to split the string `S` into sentences using the `re.split` function. The `re.split` function splits the string `S` at each occurrence of a period, question mark, or exclamation point followed by zero or more whitespace characters.

The `sum` function then counts the number of sentences in `S` that start with "I ". This is done by iterating over each sentence in `S` and checking if the first two characters of the sentence are "I ". If they are, the sentence is counted.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `is_bored` on the input "I love It !" is 1. There is one sentence in the input string that starts with "I ".

The string "I love It !" is split into the sentences ["I love It !"]. The first two characters of the first sentence "I love It !" are "I " and "I " does not equal "I ", so the function `is_bored` returns 0.

The string "I love It !" is split into the sentences ["I love It !"]. The first two characters of the first sentence "I love It !" are "I " and "I " does equal "I ", so the function `is_bored` returns 1.
