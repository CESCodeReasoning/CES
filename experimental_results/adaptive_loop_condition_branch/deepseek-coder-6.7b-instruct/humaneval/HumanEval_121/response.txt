### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *
def solution(lst):
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx%2==0 and x%2==1])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
solution([5, 8, 7, 1])    
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function solution takes a list lst as input and returns the sum of all elements in the list that are at an even index and are odd numbers.

To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [5, 8, 7, 1], we need to sum all the elements in the list that are at an even index and are odd numbers.

The elements at even indices in the list are 5, 7, 1.

The elements at even indices in the list that are odd numbers are 5 and 1.

Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [5, 8, 7, 1] is 6.

The sum of 5 and 1 is 6.

The function works by iterating over the list and checking if the index of the current element is even (idx%2==0) and if the element itself is odd (x%2==1). If both conditions are met, the element is added to the sum.

The sum function adds up all the elements in the list and returns the total sum.

In Python, the enumerate function is used to get both the index and the value of each element in the list.

The list comprehension [x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx%2==0 and x%2==1] generates a new list that contains only the elements in the original list that meet the conditions.

The sum function then adds up all the elements in this new list and returns the total sum.

The function returns the sum of all odd numbers at even indices in the list.
