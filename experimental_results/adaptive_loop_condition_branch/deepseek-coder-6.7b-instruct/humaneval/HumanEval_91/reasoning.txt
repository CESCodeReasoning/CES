The function `is_bored` takes a string `S` as input and returns the number of sentences in `S` that start with "I ".

To determine the output of executing the function `is_bored` on the input "Hello world", we need to split the string `S` into sentences using the `re.split` function. The `re.split` function splits the string `S` at each occurrence of a period, question mark, or exclamation point followed by zero or more whitespace characters.

The `sum` function then counts the number of sentences in `S` that start with "I ". This is done by iterating over each sentence in `S` and checking if the first two characters of the sentence are "I ". If they are, the sentence is counted.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `is_bored` on the input "Hello world" is 0, because there is no sentence in "Hello world" that starts with "I ".
