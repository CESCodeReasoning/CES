The function `below_threshold` is called with ( l = [1, 20, 4, 10] , t = 21 ).
The function iterates over each element in the list.
Iteration 1:
    - The element 1 is less than 21, so the function continues to the next element.
Iteration 2:
    - The element 20 is not less than 21, so the function returns False.
Iteration 3:
    - The function does not execute the remaining iterations because it has already returned False.
Iteration 4:
    - The function does not execute the remaining iterations because it has already returned False.
The function has not returned a value after all iterations, so it continues to the end of the function and returns True.
