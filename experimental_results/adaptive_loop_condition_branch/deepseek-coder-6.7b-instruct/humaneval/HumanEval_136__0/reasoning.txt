The function `largest_smallest_integers` takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest and smallest negative integers in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function `largest_smallest_integers` on the input `[]`, we need to find the largest and smallest negative integers in the list. However, the input list is empty, so there are no negative integers to find.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `largest_smallest_integers` on the input `[]` is `(None, None)`.

Here, `None` is used to represent the absence of a value, as there are no negative or positive integers in the input list.

[OUTPUT]
`(None, None)`
