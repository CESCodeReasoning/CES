The function `median` is called with a list [3, 1, 2, 4, 5].
The list is sorted to become [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The length of the list is 5, which is an odd number.
The condition `len(l) % 2 == 1` is true, so the if branch is taken.
The median is the middle element of the sorted list, which is at index `len(l) // 2`.
Since `len(l) // 2` is 5 // 2 = 2, the function returns the element at index 2, which is 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])` is 3.
