For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.
### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *


def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    note_map = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}
    return [note_map[x] for x in music_string.split(' ') if x]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
parse_music('o| .| o| .| o o| o o|')
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function `parse_music` takes a string `music_string` as input and returns a list of integers. The string `music_string` is split into a list of strings using the `split(' ')` function. The `if x` condition is used to filter out any empty strings that might result from the split operation.

The function then uses a dictionary `note_map` to map the strings in the list to their corresponding integers. The keys in the dictionary are the strings to be mapped, and the values are the integers they should be mapped to.

To determine the output of executing the function `parse_music` on the input `'o| .| o| .| o o| o o|'`, we need to map each string in the input string to its corresponding integer using the `note_map` dictionary.

The strings in the input string are: 'o|', '.|', 'o|', '.|', 'o', 'o|', 'o', 'o|'.

The corresponding integers in the output list are: 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `parse_music` on the input `'o| .| o| .| o o| o o|'` is `[2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.

[OUTPUT]
[2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[/OUTPUT]
