The function `eat` is called with ( number = 5 , need = 6 , remaining = 10 ).
The condition `need <= remaining` is checked. Since 6 is not less than or equal to 10, the else branch is taken.
The function returns a list with the first element as the sum of `number` and `need` (which is 5 + 6 = 11), and the second element as the difference between `remaining` and `need` (which is 10 - 6 = 4).
Therefore, the final output of the function `eat(5, 6, 10)` is [11, 4].
