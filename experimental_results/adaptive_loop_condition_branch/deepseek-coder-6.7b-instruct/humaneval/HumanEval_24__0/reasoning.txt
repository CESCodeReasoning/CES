The function `largest_divisor` is called with ( n = 49 ).
The function iterates over the range from 49 down to 1 (in reverse order).
Iteration 1:
    - 49 is divisible by 1, so it returns 1.
Iteration 2:
    - 49 is divisible by 2, so it returns 2.
Iteration 3:
    - 49 is divisible by 3, so it returns 3.
...
Iteration 24:
    - 49 is divisible by 24, so it returns 24.
Iteration 25:
    - 49 is not divisible by 25, so it continues to the next iteration.
...
Iteration 49:
    - 49 is divisible by 49, so it returns 49.
