The function `is_prime` is called with ( n = 6 ).
The first condition checks if `n` is less than 2. Since 6 is not less than 2, the function proceeds to the loop.
The loop iterates from 2 through 5 (since ( n = 6 )).
Iteration 1 (k = 2)
   - `n` is not divisible by 2, so the function proceeds to the next iteration.
Iteration 2 (k = 3)
   - `n` is not divisible by 3, so the function proceeds to the next iteration.
Iteration 3 (k = 4)
   - `n` is divisible by 4, so the function returns False, indicating that 6 is not a prime number.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_prime(6)` is False.
