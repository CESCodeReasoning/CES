The function solution takes a list lst as input and returns the sum of all elements in the list that are at an even index and are odd numbers.

To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [2, 4, 8], we need to sum the elements at the even indices of the list.

The elements at the even indices of the list [2, 4, 8] are 2, 8.

The sum of 2 and 8 is 10.

Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [2, 4, 8] is 10.
