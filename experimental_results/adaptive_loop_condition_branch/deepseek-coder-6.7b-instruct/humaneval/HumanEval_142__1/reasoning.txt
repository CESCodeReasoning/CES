The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [-16, -9, -2, 36, 36, 26, -20, 25, -40, 20, -4, 12, -26, 35, 37] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `result` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The index `i` is 0, which is not divisible by 3 or 4, so the element at index `i` (`-16`) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 2:
    -The index `i` is 1, which is not divisible by 3 or 4, so the element at index `i` (`-9`) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 3:
    -The index `i` is 2, which is divisible by 3, so the square of the element at index `i` (`-2`) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 4:
    -The index `i` is 3, which is not divisible by 3 but is divisible by 4, so the cube of the element at index `i` (`36`) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 5:
    -The index `i` is 4, which is not divisible by 3 or 4, so the element at index `i` (`36`) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 6:
    -The index `i` is 5, which is not divisible by 3 or 4, so the element at index `i` (`26`) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 7:
    -The index `i` is 6, which is not divisible by 3 or 4, so the element at index `i` (`-20`) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 8:
    -The index `i` is 7, which is not divisible by 3 or 4, so the element at index `i` (`25`) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 9:
    -The index `i` is 8, which is not divisible by 3 or 4, so the element at index `i` (`-40`) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 10:
    -The index `i` is 9, which is not divisible by 3 or 4, so the element at index `i` (`20`) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 11:
    -The index `i` is 10, which is not divisible by 3 or 4, so the element at index `i` (`-4`) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 12:
    -The index `i` is 11, which is not divisible by 3 or 4, so the element at index `i` (`12`) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 13:
    -The index `i` is 12, which is not divisible by 3 or 4, so the element at index `i` (`-26`) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 14:
    -The index `i` is 13, which is not divisible by 3 or 4, so the element at index `i` (`35`) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 15:
    -The index `i` is 14, which is not divisible by 3 or 4, so the element at index `i` (`37`) is appended to `result`.

After all iterations, the function returns the sum of the elements in `result`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_squares([-16, -9, -2, 36, 36, 26, -20, 25, -40, 20, -4, 12, -26, 35, 37])` is 1540.
