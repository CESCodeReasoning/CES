The function `eat` is called with ( number = 4, need = 5, remaining = 1 ).
The condition `need <= remaining` is false, so the else branch is taken.
The function returns a list with the first element being the sum of `number` and `need` (which is 4 + 1 = 5), and the second element being 0 (since all the food is eaten).

Therefore, the final output of the function `eat(4, 5, 1)` is [5, 0].
