The function `fix_spaces` is called with ( text = "Exa   mple" ).
Inside the function, a variable `new_text` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates over each character in the input text.
For each character, it checks if it is a space. If it is, it increments the `end` counter. If it is not a space, it checks if the `end - start` is greater than 2. If it is, it adds a "-" followed by the character to `new_text`. If it is not, it adds `end - start` number of "_" followed by the character to `new_text`. It then updates `start` and `end` to the current index plus 1.
After the loop completes, it checks if `end - start` is greater than 2. If it is, it adds a "-" to `new_text`. If it is not, it adds `end - start` number of "_" to `new_text`.
Finally, it returns the value of `new_text`.
