The function `is_sorted` is called with ( lst = [3, 2, 1] ).
First, a dictionary `count_digit` is created to count the occurrence of each element in the list.
In the for loop, for each element `i` in `lst`, `count_digit[i]` is incremented by 1.
Then, the condition `any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst)` is checked. If any element in `lst` has more than 2 occurrences, the function returns `False`.
If the condition is not met, the condition `all(lst[i - 1] <= lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst)))` is checked. If all elements in `lst` are in ascending order, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.
