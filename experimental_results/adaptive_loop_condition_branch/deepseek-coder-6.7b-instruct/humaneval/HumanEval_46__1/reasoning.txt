The function `fib4` is called with ( n = 12 ).
The initial list `results` is [0, 0, 2, 0].
The condition ( n < 4 ) is not satisfied, so the else branch is taken.
The loop starts from 4 to 12 (inclusive).
In each iteration, the last 4 elements of `results` are added together and appended to the end of `results`. The first element of `results` is popped out.
After the loop completes, the last element of `results` is returned as the output.
