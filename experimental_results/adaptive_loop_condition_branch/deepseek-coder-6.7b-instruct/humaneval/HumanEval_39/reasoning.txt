The function `prime_fib` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, a list `f` is initialized with the first two Fibonacci numbers [0, 1].
Then, an infinite loop is started. In each iteration, a new Fibonacci number is calculated by adding the last two numbers in the list.
If the new Fibonacci number is prime (as determined by the `is_prime` function), `n` is decremented by 1.
When `n` reaches 0, the function returns the last Fibonacci number.

The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime. It returns False if the number is less than 2, and True otherwise.

The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

The first 10 Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and the first 10 prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.

The first 10 prime Fibonacci numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 13, 89, 233, 1597, 28657, 514229, 433494437.

The 1st prime Fibonacci number is 2, the 2nd prime Fibonacci number is 3, the 3rd prime Fibonacci number is 5, and so on.

Therefore, the final output of the function `prime_fib(1)` is 2.

Note: The actual execution of the function would stop after the first prime Fibonacci number, but the function is designed to continue generating Fibonacci numbers until `n` reaches 0.
