The function `can_arrange` is called with ( arr = [1,2,4,5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The loop iterates through the array from the second element to the end.
First Iteration (i = 1):
    - arr[i] < arr[i - 1] when arr[1] < arr[0]
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true. The branch is taken.
    - `ind = i` updates `ind` to 1.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - arr[i] < arr[i - 1] when arr[2] < arr[1]
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - arr[i] < arr[i - 1] when arr[3] < arr[2]
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true. The branch is taken.
    - `ind = i` updates `ind` to 3.
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    - arr[i] < arr[i - 1] when arr[4] < arr[3]
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The branch is not taken.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is now 3.
