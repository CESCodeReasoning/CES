The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [0] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `result` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The index `i` is 0, which is divisible by 3.
    -The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
    -Action: `lst[i]**2` (which is `0**2`) is appended to `result`.

Since there are no more elements in the list `lst`, the function returns the sum of the elements in `result`, which is 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_squares([0])` is 0.

[ANSWER]
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(lst)): ## [STATE]i=[0][/STATE][STATE]range(len(lst))=[0][/STATE][STATE]len(lst)=[1][/STATE]
        if i % 3 == 0: ## [CONDITION](i % 3 == 0)=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
            result.append(lst[i]**2)
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
            result.append(lst[i]**3)
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
            result.append(lst[i])
    return sum(result)
