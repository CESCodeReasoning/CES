The function `prod_signs` is called with ( arr = [-1, 1, 1, 1] ).
The condition `not arr` is false, so the else branch is taken.
The list comprehension `[abs(i) for i in arr]` calculates the absolute value of each element in the array, resulting in [1, 1, 1, 1].
The sum of this list is 4.
The condition `0 in arr` is false, so the `else` branch of the ternary operator is taken.
The length of the list `list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr))` is 1 (since there is one negative number in the array).
The expression `(-1) ** len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr)))` calculates -1 raised to the power of the number of negative numbers, resulting in -1.
The product of the sum and the result of the ternary operator is -4.

Therefore, the final output of the function `prod_signs([-1, 1, 1, 1])` is -4.
