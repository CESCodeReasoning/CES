The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a new list where every third element is sorted.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10], we need to sort every third element in the list.

The third elements in the list are 8, -12, 23, 3, and -10. After sorting these elements, the list becomes [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10].

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10] is [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10].

Note: The function uses list slicing to get every third element and the sorted function to sort these elements. The sorted function returns a new sorted list and does not modify the original list. Therefore, we need to assign the sorted list back to the original list using list slicing.

Also, the function uses the list() function to create a new list from the input list. This is because the input list is immutable and we cannot modify it directly.

Finally, the function uses the [::3] index to get every third element in the list. The [::3] index means start at the beginning of the list and end at the end of the list with a step of 3.
