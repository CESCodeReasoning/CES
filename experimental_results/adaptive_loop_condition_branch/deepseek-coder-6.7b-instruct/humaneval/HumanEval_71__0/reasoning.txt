The function `triangle_area` is called with ( a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ).
The condition `a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a` is not satisfied (since 1 + 2 > 3, 1 + 3 > 2, and 2 + 3 > 1).
Therefore, the else branch is taken.
The semi-perimeter `s` of the triangle is calculated as `(a + b + c) / 2`, which is 2.5.
The area of the triangle is calculated using Heron's formula: `area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5`.
The area is then rounded to 2 decimal places using the `round` function.
Therefore, the final output of the function `triangle_area(1, 2, 3)` is -1.
