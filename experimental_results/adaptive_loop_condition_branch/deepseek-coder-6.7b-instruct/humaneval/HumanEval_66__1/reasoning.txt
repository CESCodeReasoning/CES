The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "aAaaaXa" ).
The condition `s == ""` is false, so the else branch is taken.
The function `ord` returns the ASCII value of a character. If the character is uppercase, its ASCII value is added to the sum. If the character is lowercase or non-alphabetic, 0 is added to the sum.
The character 'a' is uppercase, so its ASCII value (97) is added to the sum.
The character 'A' is uppercase, so its ASCII value (65) is added to the sum.
The character 'a' is uppercase, so its ASCII value (97) is added to the sum.
The character 'a' is uppercase, so its ASCII value (97) is added to the sum.
The character 'A' is uppercase, so its ASCII value (65) is added to the sum.
The character 'X' is not uppercase, so 0 is added to the sum.
The character 'a' is uppercase, so its ASCII value (97) is added to the sum.
The sum of these values is 332.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digitSum("aAaaaXa")` is 332.
