The function `max_fill` takes a 2D grid and a capacity as inputs. The function calculates the total volume of the grid by summing up the elements in each row and then dividing each sum by the capacity. The result is then rounded up to the nearest integer using the `math.ceil` function. The total volume is the sum of these rounded up values.

To determine the output of executing the function `max_fill` on the input `[[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]]` and `2`, we need to calculate the total volume of the grid.

The first row of the grid has a total volume of `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`. The second row has a total volume of `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`.

Since the capacity is `2`, we need to divide each row's total volume by `2` to get the number of containers needed. This gives us `4 / 2 = 2` for the first row and `4 / 2 = 2` for the second row.

Since we need to fill these containers, we need `2 + 2 = 4` containers in total.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `max_fill` on the input `[[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]]` and `2` is `4`.
