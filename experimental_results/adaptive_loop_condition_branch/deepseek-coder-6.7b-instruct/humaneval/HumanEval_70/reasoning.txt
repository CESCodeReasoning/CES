The function `strange_sort_list` is called with ( lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list and `switch` is initialized to True.
The loop iterates until `lst` is empty.
In each iteration, it checks the value of `switch`. If `switch` is True, it appends the smallest element from `lst` to `res`, otherwise it appends the largest element. After appending, it removes the appended element from `lst` and flips the `switch`.

First Iteration:
    - lst = [1, 2, 3, 4], switch = True
    - The smallest element in lst is 1, so it is appended to `res` and removed from `lst`.
    - Now, lst = [2, 3, 4], switch = False
Second Iteration:
    - lst = [2, 3, 4], switch = False
    - The largest element in lst is 4, so it is appended to `res` and removed from `lst`.
    - Now, lst = [2, 3], switch = True
Third Iteration:
    - lst = [2, 3], switch = True
    - The smallest element in lst is 2, so it is appended to `res` and removed from `lst`.
    - Now, lst = [3], switch = False
Fourth Iteration:
    - lst = [3], switch = False
    - The largest element in lst is 3, so it is appended to `res` and removed from `lst`.
    - Now, lst = [], switch = True
`lst` is empty, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `res`, which is now [1, 4, 2, 3].

[ANSWER]
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    res, switch = [], True
    while lst: ## [STATE]lst=[[1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3], [3], []][/STATE]
        res.append(min(lst) if switch else max(lst))
        lst.remove(res[-1])
        switch = not switch
    return res
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[1, 4, 2, 3]
