The function iscube takes an integer a as input and checks if it is a perfect cube. A perfect cube is an integer that can be expressed as the cube of an integer.

To determine if a number is a perfect cube, we first take the absolute value of the number to handle negative numbers. Then, we cube the number and round it to the nearest integer. This is because the cube root of a number is always an integer if the number is a perfect cube.

We then check if the cube of this rounded number is equal to the original number. If it is, then the original number is a perfect cube and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function iscube on the input 2, we first take the absolute value of 2 to get 2. Then, we cube this number, rounding it to the nearest integer, which is 1. We then check if the cube of 1 is equal to 2. Since 1 cubed is not 2, the function returns False.

Therefore, the output of executing the function iscube on the input 2 is False.
