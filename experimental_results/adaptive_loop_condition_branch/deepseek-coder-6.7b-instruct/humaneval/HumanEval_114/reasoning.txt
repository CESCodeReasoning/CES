The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `s` becomes `s + (-2)`, which is `-2`.
    - `max_sum` is not updated as `s` is not negative.
Iteration 2:
    - `s` becomes `s + (-3)`, which is `-5`.
    - `max_sum` is not updated as `s` is not negative.
Iteration 3:
    - `s` becomes `s + (-4)`, which is `-9`.
    - `max_sum` is not updated as `s` is not negative.
Iteration 4:
    - `s` becomes `s + (-1)`, which is `-10`.
    - `max_sum` is updated to `max(-10, max_sum)`, which is `-10`.
Iteration 5:
    - `s` becomes `s + (-2)`, which is `-12`.
    - `max_sum` is updated to `max(-12, max_sum)`, which is `-2`.
Iteration 6:
    - `s` becomes `s + (-4)`, which is `-16`.
    - `max_sum` is updated to `max(-16, max_sum)`, which is `-2`.

After the loop, `max_sum` is `-2`.

If `max_sum` is 0, then the function returns the maximum negative number in `nums`. Otherwise, it returns `-max_sum`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4])` is `-2`.

[ANSWER]
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    max_sum = 0
    s = 0
    for num in nums: ## [STATE]num=[2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4][/STATE][STATE]nums=[[2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]][/STATE]
        s += -num
        if (s < 0): ## [CONDITION](s < 0)=[False, False, False, False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            s = 0
        max_sum = max(s, max_sum)
    if max_sum == 0: ## [CONDITION](max_sum == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        max_sum = max(-i for i in nums)
    min_sum = -max_sum
    return min_sum
