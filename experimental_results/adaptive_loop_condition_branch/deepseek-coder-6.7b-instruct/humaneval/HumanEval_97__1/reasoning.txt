The function multiply takes two integers a and b as input and returns the product of the last digit of a and the last digit of b.
To determine the output of executing the function multiply on the input (76, 67), we need to find the last digit of 76 and 67 and then multiply them.
The last digit of 76 is 6 and the last digit of 67 is 7.
Therefore, the output of executing the function multiply on the input (76, 67) is 6 * 7 = 42.
