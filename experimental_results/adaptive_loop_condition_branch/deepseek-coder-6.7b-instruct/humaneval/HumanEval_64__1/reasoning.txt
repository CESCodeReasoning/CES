The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "bye" ).
The string "bye" is passed to the function.
The function counts the number of vowels in the string by checking if each character in the string is in the string of vowels.
The last character of the string is checked. If it is 'y' or 'Y', then the count of vowels is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("bye")` is 1.

[ANSWER]
def vowels_count(s):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    n_vowels = sum(c in vowels for c in s)
    if s[-1] == 'y' or s[-1] == 'Y': ## [CONDITION](s[-1] == 'y' or s[-1] == 'Y')=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](s[-1] == 'y')=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](s[-1] == 'Y')=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        n_vowels += 1
    return n_vowels
