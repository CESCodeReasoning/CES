The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with duplicates removed.

To determine the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [], we need to go through the list and remove any duplicates.

The collections.Counter(numbers) will count the frequency of each number in the list. Then, we iterate over the numbers in the list and only keep the number if its count is less than or equal to 1. This means that if a number appears more than once, it will be removed from the list.

Since the input is an empty list, there are no numbers to count or remove, so the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [] is [].
