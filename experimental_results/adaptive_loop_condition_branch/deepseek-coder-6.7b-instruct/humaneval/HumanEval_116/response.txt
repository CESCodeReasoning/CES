### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *
def sort_array(arr):
    return sorted(sorted(arr), key=lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1'))
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sort_array([1,5,2,3,4]) 
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function sort_array takes a list of integers as input and returns a sorted version of the list. The list is sorted first by its natural order, and then by the number of 1's in the binary representation of each number.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4], we need to sort the list first by its natural order, which gives us [1,2,3,4,5]. Then, we sort the list again by the number of 1's in the binary representation of each number. In binary representation, 1 is represented as '1' and 0 is represented as '0'. Therefore, the number of 1's in the binary representation of each number in the list determines the order of sorting.

In the binary representation of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the number of 1's are 1, 1, 2, 2, and 2 respectively. Therefore, the sorted list by the number of 1's in the binary representation of each number is [1,2,3,4,5].

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4] is [1,2,3,4,5].

Here is the Python code to sort the list by the number of 1's in the binary representation of each number:

```python
from typing import *
def sort_array(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return sorted(sorted(arr), key=lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1'))
```

This code first sorts the list by its natural order, and then sorts the list again by the number of 1's in the binary representation of each number. The sorted function in Python is a built-in function that returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. The key parameter of the sorted function is a function that takes one argument and returns a key to use for sorting purposes. In this case, the key function is a lambda function that returns the number of 1's in the binary representation of a number.
