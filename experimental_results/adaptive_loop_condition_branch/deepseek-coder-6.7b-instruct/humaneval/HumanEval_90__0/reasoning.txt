The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input and returns the second smallest element in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [5, 1, 4, 3, 2], we need to sort the list in ascending order and then return the second element.

1. The input list [5, 1, 4, 3, 2] is sorted in ascending order to get [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
2. The sorted list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] has two elements, so the function returns the second element, which is 2.

Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [5, 1, 4, 3, 2] is 2.

Note: The function first removes duplicates from the list by converting it to a set, then converts it back to a list and sorts it. This is because sets in Python do not allow duplicate elements.

Also, the function returns None if the list has less than 2 elements. This is because there are not enough elements to find a second smallest element.
