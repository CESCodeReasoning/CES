The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a string `txt` as input and checks if the last character of the string is a letter.

To do this, the function splits the string `txt` into a list of words using the `split(' ')` method. The `[-1]` index is used to get the last element of the list.

Then, it checks if the length of the last word is 1. If the length is not 1, it means that the last word is not a single character, so it returns `False`.

Next, it checks if the ASCII value of the last character of the last word is between 97 and 122 (inclusive). If the ASCII value is not in this range, it means that the last character is not a lowercase letter, so it returns `False`.

If both conditions are met, it returns `True`, indicating that the last character of the string is a lowercase letter.

To determine the output of executing the function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` on the input "A", we need to split the string "A" into words, get the last word, check if its length is 1, and then check if its last character is a lowercase letter.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` on the input "A" is `False`.

The reason is that "A" is a single character, but it is not a lowercase letter.

So, the output of the function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("A")` is `False`.
