The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "5 apples and 6 oranges", n = 19 ).
Inside the function, a variable `lis` is initialized as an empty list.
The string `s` is split into words using the `split(' ')` function.
Iteration 1:
    -The word '5' is a digit, so it is converted to an integer and appended to `lis`.
Iteration 2:
    -The word 'apples' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 3:
    -The word 'and' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 4:
    -The word '6' is a digit, so it is converted to an integer and appended to `lis`.
Iteration 5:
    -The word 'oranges' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
The function then returns `n - sum(lis)`, which is `19 - (5 + 6)`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges",19)` is 8.

[ANSWER]
def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    lis = list()
    for i in s.split(' '): ## [STATE]i=['5', 'apples', 'and', '6', 'oranges'][/STATE][STATE]s.split()=['5', 'apples', 'and', '6', 'oranges'][/STATE]
        if i.isdigit(): ## [CONDITION](i.isdigit())=[True, False, False, True, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, N, N, Y, N][/BRANCH]
            lis.append(int(i))
    return n - sum(lis)
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
