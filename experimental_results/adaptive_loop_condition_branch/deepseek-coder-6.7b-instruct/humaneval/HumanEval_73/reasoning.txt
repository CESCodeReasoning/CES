The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element (1) is not equal to the last element (6), so `ans` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element (2) is not equal to the second last element (9), so `ans` becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The third element (3) is not equal to the third last element (7), so `ans` becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth element (5) is not equal to the fourth last element (4), so `ans` becomes 4.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6])` is 4.
