The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input. The string s is split into words using the split(' ') function. This results in a list of words.

For each word in the list, the characters in the word are sorted alphabetically using the sorted function. The sorted function returns a list of characters in ascending order.

The sorted lists of characters are then joined back into a string using the ''.join() function.

Finally, the sorted and shuffled words are joined back into a string using the ' '.join() function.

To determine the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input 'Hello World!!!', we need to split the string into words, sort the characters in each word, and then join the sorted words back together.

Therefore, the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input 'Hello World!!!' is 'Helo Wlord!!!'.

Note: The '!!!' is considered as a word in this case.
