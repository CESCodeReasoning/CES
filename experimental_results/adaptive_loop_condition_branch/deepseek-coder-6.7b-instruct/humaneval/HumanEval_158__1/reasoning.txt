The function find_max takes a list of words as input and returns the word with the maximum length that contains unique characters.

The function uses the sorted function to sort the words in the list. The key for the sorted function is a lambda function that returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the negative length of the set of characters in the word (which gives the number of unique characters in the word). The second element of the tuple is the word itself.

The sorted function sorts the words first by the first element of the tuple (which is the number of unique characters in the word), in descending order. If two words have the same number of unique characters, then the sorted function sorts the words by the second element of the tuple (which is the word itself), in ascending order.

Therefore, the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "enam", "game"] is "enam". The word "enam" has the maximum length that contains unique characters.

The word "name" has 4 unique characters (n, a, m, e), "enam" has 3 unique characters (e, n, m), and "game" has 4 unique characters (g, a, m, e).

The word "enam" has the most unique characters, so it is the first word in the sorted list.
