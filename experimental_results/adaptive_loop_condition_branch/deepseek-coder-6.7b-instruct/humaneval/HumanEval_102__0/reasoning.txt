The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 13, y = 12 ).
The condition `x > y` is false (since 13 is not greater than 12).
The condition `y % 2 == 0` is false (since 12 is not divisible by 2).
The condition `x == y` is false (since 13 is not equal to 12).
Therefore, the function returns `y - 1`, which is 12 - 1 = 11.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(13, 12)` is 11.
