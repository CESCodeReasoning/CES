The function sort_array takes an array as input and returns a sorted version of the array.

The function first checks if the length of the array is 0. If it is, it returns an empty array.

If the array is not empty, it calculates the result of adding the first and last elements of the array and taking the modulus of 2. If the result is 0, it means that the sum of the first and last elements is even, so the array should be sorted in ascending order. If the result is 1, it means that the sum of the first and last elements is odd, so the array should be sorted in descending order.

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6] is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

The function works by using the built-in sorted function in Python, which sorts an iterable and returns a new sorted list from the elements of any iterable. The reverse parameter is set to True if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is odd, and False otherwise.

The sorted function sorts the array in ascending order if the sum of the first and last elements is even, and in descending order if the sum of the first and last elements is odd.

The sorted function returns a new sorted list from the elements of the array, so the result of the function is a new sorted array.

The function does not modify the original array, it returns a new sorted array.

The function uses the modulus operator (%) to calculate the remainder of the division of the sum of the first and last elements of the array by 2.

The function uses the len function to get the length of the array, which is the number of elements in the array.

The function uses the square brackets [] to access elements of the array by index. The index of the first element is 0, and the index of the last element is len(array) - 1.

The function uses the plus operator (+) to concatenate two strings or two numbers. In this case, it is used to add the first and last elements of the array.

The function uses the colon operator (:) to slice a portion of the array. In this case, it is used to get the first and last elements of the array.
