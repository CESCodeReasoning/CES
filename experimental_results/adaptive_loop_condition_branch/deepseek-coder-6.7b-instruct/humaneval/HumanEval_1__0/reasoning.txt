The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with ( paren_string = '(()(())((())))' ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is a list to store the groups of parentheses, `current_string` is a list to store the current group of parentheses, and `current_depth` is used to track the depth of the parentheses.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is found, so `current_depth` increases to 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is found, so `current_depth` increases to 2 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ')' is found, so `current_depth` decreases to 1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is found, so `current_depth` decreases to 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since `current_depth` is 0, `current_string` is appended to `result` and `current_string` is cleared.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '(' is found, so `current_depth` increases to 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '(' is found, so `current_depth` increases to 2 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character '(' is found, so `current_depth` increases to 3 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 8:
    -The character ')' is found, so `current_depth` decreases to 2 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 9:
    -The character ')' is found, so `current_depth` decreases to 1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 10:
    -The character ')' is found, so `current_depth` decreases to 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since `current_depth` is 0, `current_string` is appended to `result` and `current_string` is cleared.
Iteration 11:
    -The character '(' is found, so `current_depth` increases to 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 12:
    -The character ')' is found, so `current_depth` decreases to 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since `current_depth` is 0, `current_string` is appended to `result` and `current_string` is cleared.

The final output of the function `separate_paren_groups('(()(())((())))')` is ['()', '(())', '()'].
