The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['()(', ')'] ).
Inside the function, a helper function `check` is defined. This function takes a string `s` as input and checks if the parentheses in `s` are balanced.

In the `match_parens` function, two strings `S1` and `S2` are formed by concatenating the first two elements of `lst`.

For `S1`, the first character is '(', and the second character is ')'. The `check` function is called with `S1` as input.

In the `check` function, a variable `val` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the balance of the parentheses.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `val` is incremented to 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `val` is incremented to 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `val` is decremented to 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `val` is decremented to 0.

Since `val` is 0 at the end of the iteration, the `check` function returns True.

For `S2`, the first character is ')', and the second character is '('. The `check` function is called with `S2` as input.

In the `check` function, a variable `val` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the balance of the parentheses.

Iteration 1:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `val` is decremented to -1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `val` is incremented to 0.

Since `val` is 0 at the end of the iteration, the `check` function returns True.

Since the `check` function returns True for both `S1` and `S2`, the function `match_parens` returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `match_parens(['()(', ')'])` is 'Yes'.

[ANSWER]
def match_parens(lst):
    def check(s):
        val = 0
        for i in s: ## [STATE]i=['(', ')', '(', ')'][/STATE][STATE]s=['()(', ')'][/STATE]
            if i == '(': ## [CONDITION](i == '(')=[True, False, True, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, N, Y, N][/BRANCH]
                val = val + 1
            else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N, Y, N, Y][/BRANCH]
                val = val - 1
            if val < 0: ## [CONDITION](val < 0)=[False, False, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, Y][/BRANCH]
                return False
        return True if val == 0 else False

    S1 = lst[0] + lst[1]
    S2 = lst[1] + lst[0]
    return 'Yes' if check(S1) or check(S2) else 'No'

[OUTPUT]
