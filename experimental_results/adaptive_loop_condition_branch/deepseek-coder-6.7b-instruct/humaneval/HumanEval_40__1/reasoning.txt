The function triples_sum_to_zero(l) takes a list of integers as its parameter.
The outermost loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
The first inner loop starts from the current element and iterates through the remaining elements to compare it against the others.
The innermost loop starts from the current element and iterates through the remaining elements to compare it against the others.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - j=1: k in the innermost loop is 2, 3, 4, 5.
    - j=2: k in the innermost loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - j=3: k in the innermost loop is 4, 5.
    - j=4: k in the innermost loop is 5.
    - j=5: No more elements to compare.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - j=2: k in the innermost loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - j=3: k in the innermost loop is 4, 5.
    - j=4: k in the innermost loop is 5.
    - j=5: No more elements to compare.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
    - j=3: k in the innermost loop is 4, 5.
    - j=4: k in the innermost loop is 5.
    - j=5: No more elements to compare.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
    - j=4: k in the innermost loop is 5.
    - j=5: No more elements to compare.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - j=5: No more elements to compare.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.
