The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 12, y = 15 ).
The first condition checks if `x` is greater than `y`. Since `12` is not greater than `15`, the first condition is not met.
The second condition checks if `y` is an even number. `15` is not an even number, so the second condition is not met.
The third condition checks if `x` is equal to `y`. Since `12` is not equal to `15`, the third condition is not met.
Finally, the function returns `y - 1`. So, the function returns `15 - 1` which is `14`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(12, 15)` is `14`.
