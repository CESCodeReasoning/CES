The function `exchange` is called with ( lst1 = [100, 200], lst2 = [200, 200] ).
Inside the function, two variables `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

First, the function counts the number of odd numbers in `lst1`.
Iteration 1:
    -The number 100 is even, so it is not counted.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 200 is even, so it is not counted.
So, `odd` is 0.

Next, the function counts the number of even numbers in `lst2`.
Iteration 1:
    -The number 200 is even, so it is counted.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 200 is even, so it is counted.
So, `even` is 2.

Finally, the function checks if `even` is greater than or equal to `odd`.
Since `even` is 2 and `odd` is 0, the condition `even >= odd` is True.
So, the function returns "YES".

Therefore, the final output of the function `exchange([100, 200], [200, 200])` is "YES".
