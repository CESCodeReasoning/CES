<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the Deepseek Coder model, developed by Deepseek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science. For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.
### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *


def get_row(lst, x):
    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst))
              for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
    return sorted(
        sorted(
            coords,
            key=lambda x: x[1],
            reverse=True),
        key=lambda x: x[0])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
get_row([[1]], 2)
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function get_row takes a 2D list lst and a number x as input. It returns a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates (i, j) of the number x in the 2D list lst.

To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2, we need to find the coordinates of the number 2 in the 2D list [[1]]. Since 2 is not present in the list, the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2 is an empty list.

The function get_row works by iterating over the 2D list lst using two nested for loops. For each element in the 2D list, it checks if the element is equal to x. If it is, it adds the coordinates (i, j) of the element to the list coords.

After finding all the coordinates of x in the 2D list, the function sorts the list coords first by the second element of each tuple (i.e., the column index), in descending order. Then it sorts the list coords first by the first element of each tuple (i.e., the row index), in ascending order.

Therefore, the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2 is an empty list.

The output is enclosed with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[OUTPUT]
[]
