The function get_row takes a 2D list lst and a number x as input. It returns a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates (i, j) of the number x in the 2D list lst.

To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2, we need to find the coordinates of the number 2 in the 2D list [[1]]. Since 2 is not present in the list, the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2 is an empty list.

The function get_row works by iterating over the 2D list lst using two nested for loops. For each element in the 2D list, it checks if the element is equal to x. If it is, it adds the coordinates (i, j) of the element to the list coords.

After finding all the coordinates of x in the 2D list, the function sorts the list coords first by the second element of each tuple (i.e., the column index), in descending order. Then it sorts the list coords first by the first element of each tuple (i.e., the row index), in ascending order.

Therefore, the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2 is an empty list.

The output is enclosed with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
