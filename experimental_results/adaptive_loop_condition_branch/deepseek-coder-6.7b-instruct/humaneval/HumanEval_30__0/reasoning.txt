The function get_positive takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the positive integers from the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], we need to filter out the negative numbers from the input list.

The positive numbers in the input list are 5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1. Therefore, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] is [5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1].
