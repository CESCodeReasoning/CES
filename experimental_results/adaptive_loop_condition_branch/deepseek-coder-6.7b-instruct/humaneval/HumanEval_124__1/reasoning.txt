The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '04-2003' ).
The date is stripped to remove any leading or trailing spaces.
The date is then split into month, day, and year using the '-' as the delimiter.
The month, day, and year are then converted to integers.

The first condition checks if the month is between 1 and 12. If it is not, the function returns False.

The second condition checks if the day is valid for the given month. For months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December), the day must be between 1 and 31. For months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November), the day must be between 1 and 30. For February, the day must be between 1 and 29. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns False.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns True, indicating that the date is valid.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('04-2003')` is True.
