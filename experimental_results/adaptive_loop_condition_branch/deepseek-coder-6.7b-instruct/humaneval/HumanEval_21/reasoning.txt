The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is rescaled to the range [0, 1] by subtracting the minimum number in the input list from each number and then dividing by the range of the input list (maximum number - minimum number).

To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9], we first need to find the minimum and maximum numbers in the input list. The minimum number is 2.0 and the maximum number is 49.9.

Then, for each number in the input list, we subtract the minimum number from the number and divide by the range of the input list (49.9 - 2.0 = 47.9).

Therefore, the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9] is [0.0, 1.0].

This means that the number 2.0 in the input list is rescaled to 0.0 and the number 49.9 is rescaled to 1.0.

The rescaled values indicate the relative position of each original number in the range of the input list.

For example, if we had a list of 100 numbers ranging from 0 to 100, the rescaled value of 2.0 would be at the position 0.0 in the rescaled list, and the rescaled value of 49.9 would be at the position 1.0 in the rescaled list.
