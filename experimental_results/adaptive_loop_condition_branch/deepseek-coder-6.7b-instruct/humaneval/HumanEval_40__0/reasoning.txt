The function triples_sum_to_zero(l) takes a list of integers as its parameter.
The outermost loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
The first inner loop starts from the current element and iterates through the remaining elements to compare it against the others.
The innermost loop starts from the current element and iterates through the remaining elements to compare it against the others.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2 and 3.
    - l[i]=1: compare with 2, 3, 7:
        - When j = 1 (l[j]=2), k in the innermost loop is 2, 3 and 4.
        - l[i] + l[j] + l[k]=1+2+7=10, the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=3), k in the innermost loop is 3 and 4.
        - l[i] + l[j] + l[k]=1+3+7=11, the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=7), k in the innermost loop is 4.
        - l[i] + l[j] + l[k]=1+7+7=15, the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3.
    - l[i]=2: compare with 3, 7:
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=3), k in the innermost loop is 3 and 4.
        - l[i] + l[j] + l[k]=2+3+7=12, the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=7), k in the innermost loop is 4.
        - l[i] + l[j] + l[k]=2+7+7=17, the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3.
    - l[i]=3: compare with 7:
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=7), k in the innermost loop is 4.
        - l[i] + l[j] + l[k]=3+7+7=17, the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4.
    - l[i]=7: compare with 7:
        - When j = 4 (l[j]=7), k in the innermost loop is 5.
        - l[i] + l[j] + l[k]=7+7+7=21, the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    No more elements to compare.
