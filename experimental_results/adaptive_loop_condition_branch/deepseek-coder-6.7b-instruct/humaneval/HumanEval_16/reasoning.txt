The function count_distinct_characters takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string.

To determine the output of executing the function count_distinct_characters on the input 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE', we need to:

1. Convert the string to lowercase using the lower() method. This is because Python is case-sensitive and 'a' and 'A' are considered different characters.
2. Convert the string to a set. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. By converting the string to a set, we automatically remove any duplicate characters.
3. Count the number of elements in the set using the len() function.

Therefore, the output of executing the function count_distinct_characters on the input 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' is 5.

The string 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' is 'abcdeCADECADE'. After converting to lowercase, it becomes 'abcdecadecade'. When converted to a set, it becomes {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'd', 'e'}. There are 5 unique characters in this set, so the output is 5.

The function count_distinct_characters is case-insensitive, as it treats 'a' and 'A' as the same character.

Note: The order of the characters in the set does not matter, so the output could also be 5 if the order of the characters in the string is not important.
