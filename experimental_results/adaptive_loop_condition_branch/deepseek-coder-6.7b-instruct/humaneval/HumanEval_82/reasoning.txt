The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Hello' ).
The length of the string is 5 (`len(string)`).
The first condition checks if the length is 0 or 1. Since the length is 5, it does not satisfy this condition.
The loop iterates from 2 through 5 (since `l` is 5).
Iteration 1 (i = 2)
   - `l` is not divisible by 2, so it continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 2 (i = 3)
   - `l` is not divisible by 3, so it continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 3 (i = 4)
   - `l` is divisible by 4 (5 % 4 == 0), so the function returns False.
The function does not reach the return statement, so it returns False.
Therefore, the final output of the function `prime_length('Hello')` is False.
