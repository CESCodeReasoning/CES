The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = '[[[[]]]]' ).
Inside the function, two empty lists `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` are initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '[' is found, so it's appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '[' is found, so it's appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '[' is found, so it's appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '[' is found, so it's appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ']' is found, so it's appended to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ']' is found, so it's appended to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ']' is found, so it's appended to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 8:
    -The character ']' is found, so it's appended to `closing_bracket_index`.

After reversing `closing_bracket_index`, we get `closing_bracket_index` = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0].

Iteration 1:
    -The first index of `opening_bracket_index` (0) is less than the first index of `closing_bracket_index` (7), so `cnt` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second index of `opening_bracket_index` (1) is less than the second index of `closing_bracket_index` (6), so `cnt` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The third index of `opening_bracket_index` (2) is less than the third index of `closing_bracket_index` (5), so `cnt` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth index of `opening_bracket_index` (3) is less than the fourth index of `closing_bracket_index` (4), so `cnt` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 5:
    -The fifth index of `opening_bracket_index` (4) is less than the fifth index of `closing_bracket_index` (3), so `cnt` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The sixth index of `opening_bracket_index` (5) is less than the sixth index of `closing_bracket_index` (2), so `cnt` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 7:
    -The seventh index of `opening_bracket_index` (6) is less than the seventh index of `closing_bracket_index` (1), so `cnt` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 8:
    -The eighth index of `opening_bracket_index` (7) is less than the eighth index of `closing_bracket_index` (0), so `cnt` is incremented by 1.

So, `cnt` is 8, which is greater than or equal to 2, so the function returns True.
