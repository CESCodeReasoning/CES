### Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
from typing import *
def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
filter_integers([3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b']) 
[/INPUT]

### Response
[REASONING]
The function filter_integers takes a list of values as input and returns a new list that contains only the integers from the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b'], we need to filter out the non-integer values from the input list.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each value in the input list. The isinstance function is used to check if each value is an integer. If it is, the value is included in the new list. If it is not, the value is ignored.

Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b'] is [3, 3, 3].

The integers 3, 3, and 3 are the only values in the input list that are integers, so they are included in the output list. The string 'c', the string 'a', and the string 'b' are not integers, so they are ignored.

Therefore, the output of the function is [3, 3, 3].
