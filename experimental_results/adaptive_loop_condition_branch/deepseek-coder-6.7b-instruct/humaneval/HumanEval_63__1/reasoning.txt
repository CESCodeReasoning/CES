The function `fibfib` is called with ( n = 10 ).
The first condition checks if `n` is 0. It is not, so it moves to the next condition.
The second condition checks if `n` is 1. It is not, so it moves to the next condition.
The third condition checks if `n` is 2. It is not, so it moves to the final return statement.
The final return statement is a recursive call to `fibfib` with arguments `n - 1`, `n - 2`, and `n - 3`.

The recursion will continue until `n` is 0 or 1. At this point, the function will return 0.

The sum of these returned values will be calculated and returned by the function.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fibfib(10)` is 14.

[ANSWER]
def fibfib(n: int):
    if n == 0: ## [CONDITION](n == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return 0
    if n == 1: ## [CONDITION](n == 1)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return 0
    if n == 2: ## [CONDITION](n == 2)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return 1
    return fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)
