The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "AB" ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'A' is not in primes, so no increment.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'B' is in primes, so total becomes 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `hex_key("AB")` is 1.
