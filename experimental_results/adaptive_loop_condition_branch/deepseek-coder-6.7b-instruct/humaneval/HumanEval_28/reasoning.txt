The function concatenate takes a list of strings as input and returns the concatenation of all the strings in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function concatenate on the input ['x', 'y', 'z'], we need to join all the strings in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function concatenate on the input ['x', 'y', 'z'] is "xyz".
