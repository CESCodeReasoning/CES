The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1, 4, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element (1) is not equal to the last element (2), so `ans` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element (4) is not equal to the second last element (4), so `ans` remains 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1, 4, 2])` is 1.
