The function decimal_to_binary takes an integer decimal as input and returns a string. The function converts the decimal number to binary using the built-in bin function in Python. The bin function returns a string that starts with '0b' to indicate that it is a binary number, so we use slicing [2:] to remove the first two characters from the string. Then, the function concatenates 'db' at the beginning and end of the binary string to form a new string.

To determine the output of executing the function decimal_to_binary on the input 32, we need to convert the decimal number 32 to binary. The binary representation of 32 is '100000'. Therefore, the output of executing the function decimal_to_binary on the input 32 is 'db100000db'.
