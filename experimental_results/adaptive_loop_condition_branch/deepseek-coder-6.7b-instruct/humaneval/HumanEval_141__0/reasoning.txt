The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = 'I563_No.exe' ).
The function splits the file_name into two parts using the '.' as the separator.
The first part is 'I563_No' and the second part is 'exe'.
The length of the split list is 2, so the first condition is not met.
The second part 'exe' is in the list of allowed suffixes, so the second condition is met.
The first part 'I563_No' is not empty, so the third condition is met.
The first character of the first part 'I' is an alphabet, so the fourth condition is met.
The number of digits in the first part 'I563_No' is 3, so the fifth condition is not met.

Therefore, the final output of the function `file_name_check('I563_No.exe')` is 'No'.
