The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order.

Iteration 1:
    -The string 'AI' has an even length, so it is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 2:
    -The string 'asdf' has an even length, so it is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The string 'b' has an even length, so it is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 4:
    -The string 'school' has an odd length, so it is not appended to `new_lst`.

After the loop, `new_lst` is sorted by length.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sorted_list_sum(["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"])` is ['b', 'asdf', 'AI'].

[ANSWER]
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    lst.sort()
    new_lst = []
    for i in lst: ## [STATE]i=['school', 'AI', 'asdf', 'b'][/STATE][STATE]lst=['school', 'AI', 'asdf', 'b'][/STATE]
        if len(i) % 2 == 0: ## [CONDITION](len(i) % 2 == 0)=[False, True, True, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, Y, Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            new_lst.append(i)
    return sorted(new_lst, key=len)
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
['b', 'asdf', 'AI']
