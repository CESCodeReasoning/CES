The function `how_many_times` is called with ( string = 'xyxyxyx', substring = 'x' ).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The substring 'x' is found at the beginning of the string 'xyxyxyx', so `times` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The substring 'x' is found at the second position of the string 'xyxyxyx', so `times` becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    - The substring 'x' is found at the third position of the string 'xyxyxyx', so `times` becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    - The substring 'x' is found at the fourth position of the string 'xyxyxyx', so `times` becomes 4.
Iteration 5:
    - The substring 'x' is found at the fifth position of the string 'xyxyxyx', so `times` becomes 5.
Iteration 6:
    - The substring 'x' is found at the sixth position of the string 'xyxyxyx', so `times` becomes 6.
Iteration 7:
    - The substring 'x' is found at the seventh position of the string 'xyxyxyx', so `times` becomes 7.

Therefore, the final output of the function `how_many_times('xyxyxyx', 'x')` is 7.
