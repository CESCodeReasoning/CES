The function filter_integers takes a list of values as input and returns a new list that contains only the integers from the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [4, {}, [], 23.2, 9, 'adasd'], we need to filter out the non-integer values from the input list.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list. The isinstance function is used to check if each element is an integer. If it is, the element is included in the new list. If it is not, the element is ignored.

Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [4, {}, [], 23.2, 9, 'adasd'] is [4, 9].

The elements {} and [] are not integers, so they are ignored. The float 23.2 is not an integer, so it is also ignored. The string 'adasd' is not an integer, so it is also ignored. The integers 4 and 9 are included in the new list.

So, the output of the function is a list containing only the integers from the input list.
