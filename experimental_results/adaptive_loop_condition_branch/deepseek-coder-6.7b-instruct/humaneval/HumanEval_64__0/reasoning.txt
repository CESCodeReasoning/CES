The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "bYe" ).
The string "bYe" is passed to the function.
The function counts the number of vowels in the string by checking if each character in the string is in the string of vowels.
The last character of the string is 'y' or 'Y'.
The condition `s[-1] == 'y' or s[-1] == 'Y'` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns `n_vowels + 1`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("bYe")` is 1.
