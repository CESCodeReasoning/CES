The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'xywyx' ).
The length of the text is 5.

Iteration 1:
    - The characters 'x' and 'x' are the same, so the loop continues.
Iteration 2:
    - The characters 'y' and 'w' are not the same, so the function returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_palindrome('xywyx')` is False.
