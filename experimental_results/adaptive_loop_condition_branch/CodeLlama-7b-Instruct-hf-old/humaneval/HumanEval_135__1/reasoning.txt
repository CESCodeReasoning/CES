The function `can_arrange` takes an array of integers as input.
The function returns the index of the first element in the array that is smaller than the previous element, or -1 if no such element is found.
The function uses a while loop to iterate through the array.
The loop starts at index 1 and continues until the end of the array is reached.
Inside the loop, the function checks if the current element is smaller than the previous element.
If the condition is true, the function sets the variable `ind` to the current index.
Otherwise, the function increments the variable `i` by 1 and continues the loop.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`.
