The function solution takes a list of integers lst as input and returns the sum of all the even indices that contain odd numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [2, 4, 8], we need to follow the steps below:

1. The list [2, 4, 8] has three elements.
2. The first element is 2, which is even.
3. The second element is 4, which is even.
4. The third element is 8, which is even.
5. The sum of the even indices that contain odd numbers is 2 + 4 + 8 = 14.

Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [2, 4, 8] is 14.
