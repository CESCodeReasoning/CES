The function `Strongest_Extension` is called with ( class_name = "finNNalLLly", extensions = ['Die', 'NowW', 'Wow', 'WoW'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `strong` is initialized to the first element of the `extensions` list.
The variable `my_val` is initialized to the length of the list comprehension `[x for x in extensions[0] if x.isalpha() and x.isupper()]` minus the length of the list comprehension `[x for x in extensions[0] if x.isalpha() and x.islower()]`.
The loop iterates over the elements of the `extensions` list.
First Iteration (s = 'Die'):
   - The condition `val > my_val` is false.
   - Action: `strong` remains the same.
Second Iteration (s = 'NowW'):
   - The condition `val > my_val` is false.
   - Action: `strong` remains the same.
Third Iteration (s = 'Wow'):
   - The condition `val > my_val` is true.
   - Action: `strong` is updated to 'Wow'.
Fourth Iteration (s = 'WoW'):
   - The condition `val > my_val` is true.
   - Action: `strong` is updated to 'WoW'.

Therefore, the final value of `strong` is 'WoW'.
