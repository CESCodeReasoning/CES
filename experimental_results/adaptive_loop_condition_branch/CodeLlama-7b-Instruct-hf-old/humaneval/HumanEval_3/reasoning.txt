The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -3, 1, 2, -3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `op` is 1, so `balance` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - `op` is 2, so `balance` becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    - `op` is -3, so `balance` becomes -2.
    - The condition `balance < 0` is true, so the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `below_zero([1, 2, -3, 1, 2, -3])` is `True`.
