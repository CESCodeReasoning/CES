The function `pluck` is called with ( arr = [4,2,3] ).
The first condition `len(arr) == 0` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The second condition `evens == []` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The function returns [min(evens), arr.index(min(evens))].

Therefore, the final output of the function `pluck([4,2,3])` is [2, 1].
