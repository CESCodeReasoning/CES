The function `is_simple_power` is called with ( x = 128, n = 4 ).
Inside the function, a variable `power` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 1 through 4 (since ( n = 4 )).
First Iteration (power = 1):
    - power < x when power=1 and x=128
    -`power = power * n` updates `power` to 4 ( 1 * 4 = 4 ).
Second Iteration (power = 4):
    - power < x when power=4 and x=128
    -`power = power * n` updates `power` to 16 ( 4 * 4 = 16 ).
Third Iteration (power = 16):
    - power < x when power=16 and x=128
    -`power = power * n` updates `power` to 64 ( 16 * 4 = 64 ).
Fourth Iteration (power = 64):
    - power < x when power=64 and x=128
    -`power = power * n` updates `power` to 256 ( 64 * 4 = 256 ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( power == x ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken and the function returns `False` as the output.
