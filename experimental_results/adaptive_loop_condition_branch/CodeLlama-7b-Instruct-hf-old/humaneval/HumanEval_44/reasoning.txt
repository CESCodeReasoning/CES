The function `change_base` is called with ( x = 8, base = 3 ).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to an empty string.
First Iteration:
    - x = 8, x > 0 is true.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "2" ( "2" + "" = "2" ).
    - x //= base updates x to 2.
Second Iteration:
    - x = 2, x > 0 is true.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "10" ( "10" + "2" = "102" ).
    - x //= base updates x to 1.
Third Iteration:
    - x = 1, x > 0 is false. The while loop terminates.
The function returns the value of `ret`, which is now "102".
