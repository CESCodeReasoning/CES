The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether n is even and greater than or equal to 8.
To determine the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 13, we need to evaluate the expression n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8.
n % 2 == 0 evaluates to True since 13 is odd.
n >= 8 evaluates to False since 13 is less than 8.
Therefore, the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 13 is False.
