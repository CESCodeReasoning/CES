The function `order_by_points` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers sorted in ascending order based on the sum of their digits.

The function first defines a helper function `digits_sum` that takes a number as input and returns the sum of its digits. If the number is negative, the function negates it and then calculates the sum of its digits.

The function then uses the `sorted` function to sort the input list `nums` based on the `key` function `digits_sum`. The `key` function is a lambda function that takes a number `n` and returns the sum of its digits.

Therefore, the final output of the function `order_by_points([])` is an empty list.
