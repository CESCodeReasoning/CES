The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '03-11-2000' ).
`date` is a string, which is then stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.
The string is then split into three parts using the '-' character as a delimiter.
The resulting parts are then converted to integers using the `int()` method.
The month, day, and year are then assigned to the variables `month`, `day`, and `year` respectively.

The next step is to check if the month is valid.
The month is checked to be between 1 and 12, inclusive.
If the month is not between 1 and 12, the method returns False.

Next, the day is checked to be valid.
If the month is in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12], the day must be between 1 and 31, inclusive.
If the month is in [4, 6, 9, 11], the day must be between 1 and 30, inclusive.
If the month is 2, the day must be between 1 and 29, inclusive.
If any of the above conditions are not met, the method returns False.

Finally, the method returns True if all the conditions are met.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('03-11-2000')` is True.
