The function find_closest_elements(numbers) takes a list of floats(numbers) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterats through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by idx in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (idx=0):
    - `idx` is 0, `elem` is 1.1, `idx2` is 0, `elem2` is 1.1.
    - `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - `distance` is None, the if branch is taken.
    - `distance` is assigned the value of `abs(elem - elem2)` which is 0.
    - `closest_pair` is assigned the value of `tuple(sorted([elem, elem2]))` which is (1.1, 1.1).
Second Iteration (idx=1):
    - `idx` is 1, `elem` is 2.2, `idx2` is 0, `elem2` is 1.1.
    - `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
    - `distance` is None, the if branch is taken.
    - `distance` is assigned the value of `abs(elem - elem2)` which is 1.1.
    - `closest_pair` is assigned the value of `tuple(sorted([elem, elem2]))` which is (1.1, 2.2).
Third Iteration (idx=2):
    - `idx` is 2, `elem` is 3.1, `idx2` is 0, `elem2` is 1.1.
    - `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
    - `distance` is None, the if branch is taken.
    - `distance` is assigned the value of `abs(elem - elem2)` which is 2.1.
    - `closest_pair` is assigned the value of `tuple(sorted([elem, elem2]))` which is (1.1, 3.1).
Forth Iteration (idx=3):
    - `idx` is 3, `elem` is 4.1, `idx2` is 0, `elem2` is 1.1.
    - `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
    - `distance` is None, the if branch is taken.
    - `distance` is assigned the value of `abs(elem - elem2)` which is 3.1.

    - `distance` is None, the if branch is taken.
    - `distance` is assigned the value of `abs(elem - elem2)` which is 4.1.
    - `closest_pair` is assigned the value of `tuple(sorted([elem, elem2]))` which is (1.1, 5.1).
Sixth Iteration (idx=5):
