The function select_words(s, n) takes a string s and an integer n as its parameters.
The function splits the string s into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter.
The outer loop iterates through each word in the list of words.
In the inner loop, for each word indexed by i in the outer loop, count the number of consonants in the word.
