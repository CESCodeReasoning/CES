The function `is_happy` is called with ( s = "xyy" ).
Inside the function, a conditional statement checks if the length of the input string ( s ) is less than 3.
If the length is less than 3, the function returns False.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of "xyy" is 3, so the conditional statement is not executed.

Iteration 2:
    -The loop iterates from 0 to (len(s) - 2) = 0.
    -The first character of "xyy" is "x", which is not equal to the second character "y" or the third character "y".
    -The conditional statement is not executed.

Iteration 3:
    -The loop iterates from 1 to (len(s) - 2) = 1.
    -The first character of "xyy" is "x", which is not equal to the second character "y" or the third character "y".
    -The conditional statement is not executed.

Iteration 4:
    -The loop iterates from 2 to (len(s) - 2) = 2.
    -The first character of "xyy" is "x", which is not equal to the second character "y" or the third character "y".
    -The conditional statement is not executed.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_happy("xyy")` is True.
