The function `do_algebra` is called with (operator = ['**', '*', '+'], operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]).
Inside the function, a variable `expression` is initialized to the first element of `operand`, which is 2.
The loop iterates over the rest of the elements of `operand` and `operator`.
First Iteration(oprt = '**', oprn = 3):
    expression = '2**3'
Second Iteration(oprt = '*', oprn = 4):
    expression = '2**3*4'
Third Iteration(oprt = '+', oprn = 5):
    expression = '2**3*4+5'
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `expression`, which is now '2**3*4+5'.
