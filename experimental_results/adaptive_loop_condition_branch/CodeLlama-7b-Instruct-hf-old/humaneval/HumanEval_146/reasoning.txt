The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [5, -2, 1, -5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the elements of `nums`.
First Iteration (num = 5)
   - `num` is 5, which is greater than 10.
   - The condition `num > 10` is true.
   - The variable `odd_digits` is defined as (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
   - The string representation of `num` is "5".
   - The first digit of "5" is 5, which is not in `odd_digits`.
   - The last digit of "5" is 5, which is in `odd_digits`.
   - The condition `int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits` is false.
   - Action: `count` is not updated.
Second Iteration (num = -2)
   - `num` is -2, which is less than 10.
   - The condition `num > 10` is false.
   - The variable `odd_digits` is defined as (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
   - The string representation of `-2` is "-2".
   - The first digit of "-2" is -, which is not in `odd_digits`.
   - The last digit of "-2" is 2, which is in `odd_digits`.
   - The condition `int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits` is false.
   - Action: `count` is not updated.
Third Iteration (num = 1)
   - `num` is 1, which is greater than 10.
   - The condition `num > 10` is true.
   - The variable `odd_digits` is defined as (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
   - The string representation of `num` is "1".
   - The first digit of "1" is 1, which is in `odd_digits`.
   - The last digit of "1" is 1, which is in `odd_digits`.
   - The condition `int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits` is true.
   - Action: `count` is updated to 1.
Fourth Iteration (num = -5)
   - `num` is -5, which is less than 10.
   - The condition `num > 10` is false.
   - The variable `odd_digits` is defined as (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
   - The string representation of `-5` is "-5".
   - The first digit of "-5" is -, which is not in `odd_digits`.
   - The last digit of "-5" is 5, which is in `odd_digits`.
   - The condition `int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits` is false.
   - Action: `count` is not updated.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `count`, which is 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `specialFilter([5, -2, 1, -5])` is 1.
