The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted.
A new list `new_lst` is created and initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates through the sorted list `lst`.
First Iteration (i = "AI")
   - The length of `i` is 2, which is even.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` adds "AI" to `new_lst`.
Second Iteration (i = "asdf")
   - The length of `i` is 4, which is even.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` adds "asdf" to `new_lst`.
Third Iteration (i = "b")
   - The length of `i` is 1, which is odd.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` adds "b" to `new_lst`.
Fourth Iteration (i = "school")
   - The length of `i` is 6, which is even.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` adds "school" to `new_lst`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the sorted list `new_lst`, which is ["AI", "asdf", "b", "school"].

Therefore, the final output of the function `sorted_list_sum(["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"])` is ["AI", "asdf", "b", "school"].
