The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '01-01-2007' ).
`date` is '01-01-2007', which is a string.
The function first strips the leading and trailing whitespaces from `date`.
The function then splits `date` into three parts: `month`, `day`, and `year`.
The function then converts `month`, `day`, and `year` to integers.
The function then checks if `month` is less than 1 or greater than 12.
If the condition is true, the function returns False.
The function then checks if `month` is in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and `day` is less than 1 or greater than 31.
If the condition is true, the function returns False.
The function then checks if `month` is in [4, 6, 9, 11] and `day` is less than 1 or greater than 30.
If the condition is true, the function returns False.
The function then checks if `month` is 2 and `day` is less than 1 or greater than 29.
If the condition is true, the function returns False.
The function then returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('01-01-2007')` is True.
