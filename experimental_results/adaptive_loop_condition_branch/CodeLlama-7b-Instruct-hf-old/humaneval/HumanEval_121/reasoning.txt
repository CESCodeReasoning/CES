The function solution takes a list of integers lst as input and returns the sum of all the even indices that contain odd numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [5, 8, 7, 1], we need to follow the steps below:

1. The list [5, 8, 7, 1] is passed as an argument to the function solution.
2. The list comprehension [x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx%2==0 and x%2==1] is executed. This list comprehension iterates over the elements of the input list and selects only the even indices that contain odd numbers. The resulting list is [8, 7].
3. The sum of the elements in the resulting list is calculated, which gives the output 15.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [5, 8, 7, 1] is 15.
