The function `fib` is called with ( n = 12 ).
The first condition `n == 0` is not satisfied, so the second condition `n == 1` is checked.
`n` is 12, which does not satisfy `n == 1`.
Therefore, the third branch is taken, and the function recursively calls itself with `n - 1` and `n - 2`.
The function calls itself with `n - 1 = 11` and `n - 2 = 10`.
The function calls itself with `n - 1 = 10` and `n - 2 = 9`.
The function calls itself with `n - 1 = 9` and `n - 2 = 8`.
The function calls itself with `n - 1 = 8` and `n - 2 = 7`.
The function calls itself with `n - 1 = 7` and `n - 2 = 6`.
The function calls itself with `n - 1 = 6` and `n - 2 = 5`.
The function calls itself with `n - 1 = 5` and `n - 2 = 4`.
The function calls itself with `n - 1 = 4` and `n - 2 = 3`.
The function calls itself with `n - 1 = 3` and `n - 2 = 2`.
The function calls itself with `n - 1 = 2` and `n - 2 = 1`.
The function calls itself with `n - 1 = 1` and `n - 2 = 0`.
The function returns the sum of the two recursive calls, which are 55 and 89.
Therefore, the final output of the function `fib(12)` is 144.
