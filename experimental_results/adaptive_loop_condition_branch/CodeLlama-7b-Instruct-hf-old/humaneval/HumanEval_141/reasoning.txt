The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = "example.txt" ).
The function first splits the file name into a list using the separator '.'.
The list has two elements: "example" and "txt".
The condition `len(lst) != 2` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition `not lst[1] in suf` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition `len(lst[0]) == 0` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition `not lst[0][0].isalpha()` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition `t > 3` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
Therefore, the final output of the function `file_name_check("example.txt")` is "Yes".
