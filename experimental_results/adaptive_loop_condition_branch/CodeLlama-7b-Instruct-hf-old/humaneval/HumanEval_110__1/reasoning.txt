The function `exchange` is called with ( lst1 = [100, 200], lst2 = [200, 200] ).
Inside the function, two variables `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The element 100 in lst1 is odd, so `odd` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 200 in lst1 is even, so `even` becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The element 200 in lst2 is even, so `even` becomes 2.

The condition `even >= odd` is true, so the function returns "YES".

Therefore, the final output of the function `exchange([100, 200], [200, 200])` is "YES".
