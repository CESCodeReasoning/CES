The function `how_many_times` is called with ( string = "john doe", substring = "john" ).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The substring "john" is found at index 0 in the string "john doe".
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is true.
    -Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The substring "john" is not found at index 1 in the string "john doe".
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is false.
    -Action: `times += 1` does not update `times`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `how_many_times('john doe', 'john')` is 1.
