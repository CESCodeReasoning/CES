The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "1/5", n = "5/1" ).
`x` is a string of the form "a/b", where a and b are integers.
`n` is a string of the form "c/d", where c and d are integers.
The function splits the strings into their integer components, a and b, and c and d.
The numerator of the fraction is calculated as the product of a and c, and the denominator is calculated as the product of b and d.
The condition (numerator/denom == int(numerator/denom)) is evaluated.
If the condition is true, then the method returns True.
Otherwise, the method returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("1/5", "5/1")` is True.
