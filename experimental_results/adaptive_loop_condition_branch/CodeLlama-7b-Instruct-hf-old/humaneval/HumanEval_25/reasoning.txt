The function `factorize` is called with ( n = 2 ).
Inside the function, a variable `fact` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 2 through 3 (since ( n = 2 ) and ( int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) = 3 )).
First Iteration (i = 2):
    - i <= int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) when i=2 and int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)=3
    - The conditin `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `i += 1` updates `i` to 3.
Second Iteration (i = 3):
    - i <= int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) when i=3 and int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)=3
    - The conditin `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken. `i += 1` updates `i` to 4.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `fact`, which is now [2].
