The function incr_list takes a list l as input and returns a new list where each element is the sum of the corresponding element in l and 1.
To determine the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], we need to add 1 to each element in the input list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123] is [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124].
