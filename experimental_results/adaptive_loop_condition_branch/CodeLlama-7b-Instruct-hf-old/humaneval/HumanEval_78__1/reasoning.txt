The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "123456789ABCDEF0" ).
Inside the function, a variable `primes` is initialized to ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D').
The loop iterates from 0 to 16 (since ( len(num) = 16 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `num[i]` is '1', which is not in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - Action: `total` remains 0.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `num[i]` is '2', which is in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total` becomes 1.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `num[i]` is '3', which is not in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - Action: `total` remains 1.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `num[i]` is '4', which is not in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - Action: `total` remains 1.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `num[i]` is '5', which is in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total` becomes 2.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `num[i]` is '6', which is not in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - Action: `total` remains 2.
Seventh Iteration (i = 6)
   - `num[i]` is '7', which is not in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - Action: `total` remains 2.
Eighth Iteration (i = 7)
   - `num[i]` is '8', which is not in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - Action: `total` remains 2.
Ninth Iteration (i = 8)
   - `num[i]` is '9', which is not in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - Action: `total` remains 2.
Tenth Iteration (i = 9)
   - `num[i]` is 'A', which is not in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - Action: `total` remains 2.
Eleventh Iteration (i = 10)
   - `num[i]` is 'B', which is in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total` becomes 3.
Twelfth Iteration (i = 11)
   - `num[i]` is 'C', which is not in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - Action: `total` remains 3.
Thirteenth Iteration (i = 12)
   - `num[i]` is 'D', which is in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total` becomes 4.
Fourteenth Iteration (i = 13)
   - `num[i]` is 'E', which is not in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - Action: `total` remains 4.
Fifteenth Iteration (i = 14)
   - `num[i]` is 'F', which is not in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - Action: `total` remains 4.
Sixteenth Iteration (i = 15)
   - `num[i]` is '0', which is not in primes.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - Action: `total` remains 4.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `total`, which is now 4.

Therefore, the final output of the function `hex_key("123456789ABCDEF0")` is 4.
