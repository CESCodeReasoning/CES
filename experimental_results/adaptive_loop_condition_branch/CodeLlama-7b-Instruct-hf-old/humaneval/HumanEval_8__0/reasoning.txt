The function `sum_product` is called with an empty list (numbers = []).
Inside the function, two variables `sum_value` and `prod_value` are initialized to 0 and 1 respectively.
The loop iterates over the empty list (since numbers = []).
After the loop completes, the function returns the tuple (sum_value, prod_value) = (0, 1).
