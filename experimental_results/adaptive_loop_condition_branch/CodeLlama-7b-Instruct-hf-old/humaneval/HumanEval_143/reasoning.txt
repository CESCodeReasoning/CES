The function words_in_sentence(sentence) takes a sentence as its parameter.
The outer loop iterats through each word in the sentence.
In the inner loop, for each word indexed by i, compare it with every other word that comes after it in the sentence.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - word=sentence.split()[0]=??
    - flg=0
    - for i in range(2, len(word)):
        - When i = 2 (len(word)=??), the condition `len(word)%i == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When i = 3 (len(word)=??), the condition `len(word)%i == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When i = 4 (len(word)=??), the condition `len(word)%i == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When i = 5 (len(word)=??), the condition `len(word)%i == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - word=sentence.split()[1]=??
    - flg=0
    - for i in range(2, len(word)):
        - When i = 2 (len(word)=??), the condition `len(word)%i == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When i = 3 (len(word)=??), the condition `len(word)%i == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When i = 4 (len(word)=??), the condition `len(word)%i == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When i = 5 (len(word)=??), the condition `len(word)%i == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
    - word=sentence.split()[2]=??
    - flg=0
    - for i in range(2, len(word)):
        - When i = 3 (len(word)=??), the condition `len(word)%i == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When i = 4 (len(word)=??), the condition `len(word)%i == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When i = 5 (len(word)=??), the condition `len(word)%i == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
    - word=sentence.split()[3]=??
    - flg=0
    - for i in range(2, len(word)):
        - When i = 4 (len(word)=??), the condition `len(word)%i == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When i = 5 (len(word)=??), the condition `len(word)%i == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - word=sentence.split()[4]=??
    - flg=0
    - for i in range(2, len(word)):
        - When i = 5 (len(word)=??), the condition `len(word)%i == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - word=sentence.split()[5]=??
    - flg=0
    - for i in range(2, len(word)):
        - When i = 5 (len(word)=??), the condition `len(word)%i == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
