The function encode takes a string message as input and returns a new string where all the vowels are replaced with their uppercase counterparts, and all the consonants are replaced with their lowercase counterparts.

To determine the output of executing the function encode on the input "I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE", we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to identify the vowels in the input string. The vowels in this case are "a", "e", "i", "o", and "u".
2. Next, we need to create a dictionary that maps each vowel to its uppercase counterpart. This dictionary is created using a list comprehension, where each element is a tuple containing the vowel and its uppercase counterpart.
3. Then, we need to swap the case of the input string. This is done by calling the swapcase() method on the input string.
4. Finally, we need to iterate over each character in the swapped string and replace each vowel with its uppercase counterpart. This is done using a list comprehension, where each element is a tuple containing the character and its uppercase counterpart.

The output of executing the function encode on the input "I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE" is "i dOnT kNoW wHaT tO wRiTe".
