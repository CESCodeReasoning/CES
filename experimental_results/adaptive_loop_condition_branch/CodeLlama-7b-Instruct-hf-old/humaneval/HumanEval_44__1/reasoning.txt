The function `change_base` is called with ( x = 9, base = 3 ).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to an empty string.
First Iteration:
    - x = 9, x > 0 is true.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "2" ( "2" + "" = "2" ).
    - x //= base updates x to 3 ( 9 // 3 = 3 ).
Second Iteration:
    - x = 3, x > 0 is true.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "1" ( "1" + "2" = "12" ).
    - x //= base updates x to 1 ( 3 // 3 = 1 ).
Third Iteration:
    - x = 1, x > 0 is false. The while loop terminates.
    - The function returns the value of `ret`, which is now "12".
