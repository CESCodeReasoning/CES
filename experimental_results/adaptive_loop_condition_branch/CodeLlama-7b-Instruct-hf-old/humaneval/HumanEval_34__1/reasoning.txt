The function unique takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of unique elements in l.
To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1], we need to remove the duplicates from the list and then sort the remaining elements.
Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1] is [1, 2].
