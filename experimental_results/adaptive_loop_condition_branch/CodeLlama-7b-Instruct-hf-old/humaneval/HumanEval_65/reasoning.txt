The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 100, shift = 2 ).
`x` is 100, which is a positive integer.
`shift` is 2, which is a positive integer.
The condition `shift > len(s)` is false, therefore the else branch is taken and the method returns the string `s[::-1]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(100, 2)` is "001".
