The function `median` is called with ( l = [8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7] ).
The list `l` is sorted, resulting in [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 9].
The length of the list is 7, which is odd.
Therefore, the if branch is taken and the method returns the middle element of the list, which is 7.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7])` is 7.
