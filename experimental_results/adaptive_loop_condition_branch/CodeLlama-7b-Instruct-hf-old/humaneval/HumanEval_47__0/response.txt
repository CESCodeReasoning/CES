    return sum_1
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sum_of_integer(5)
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function `sum_of_integer` is called with ( N = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `sum_1` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( N = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which satisfies ( 1 <= i < 3 ).
   - The condition `i >= 1 and i < 3` is true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 1` results in `sum_1 = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which still satisfies ( 1 <=i < 3 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 1` updates `sum_1` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which now satisfies ( 3 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `i < 5` is true (while the first condition `i >= 1 and i < 3` is false).
   - Action: `sum_1 += 2` updates `sum_1` to 4 (`2 + 2 = 4`).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, also satisfying ( 3 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `i < 5` is still true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 2` updates `sum_1` to 6 (`4 + 2 = 6`).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, now outside the previous conditions, falling into the `else` block.
   - The `else` block's action: `sum_1 *= 4` updates `sum_1` to 24 (`6 * 4 = 24`).
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `sum_1`, which is now 24.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_of_integer(5)` is 24.

[REASONING]
The function `check_integer` is called with ( i = 2 ).
`i` is 2, which satisfies ( 1 <= i < 3 ).
The condition `i >= 1` and `i < 3` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns True

Therefore, the final output of the function `check_integer(2)` is True.

[REASONING]
The function `median` is called with ( l = [8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7] ).
The list `l` is sorted, resulting in [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 9].
The length of the list is 7, which is odd.
Therefore, the if branch is taken and the method returns the middle element of the list, which is 7.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7])` is 7.
