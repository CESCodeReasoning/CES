The function `parse_nested_parens` is called with ( paren_string = '((()))' ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.
The function `parse_paren_group` is called with ( s = '((()))' ).

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
    -The maximum depth is updated to 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 2.
    -The maximum depth is updated to 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
    -The maximum depth is updated to 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 0.
    -The maximum depth is updated to 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes -1.
    -The maximum depth is updated to 2.

The function `parse_paren_group` returns the maximum depth, which is 2.
The function `parse_nested_parens` returns the list [2].

Therefore, the final output of the function `parse_nested_parens('((()))')` is [2].
