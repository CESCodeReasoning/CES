[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sum_of_integer(5)
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function `sum_of_integer` is called with ( N = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `sum_1` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( N = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which satisfies ( 1 <= i < 3 ).
   - The condition `i >= 1 and i < 3` is true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 1` results in `sum_1 = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which still satisfies ( 1 <=i < 3 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 1` updates `sum_1` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which now satisfies ( 3 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `i < 5` is true (while the first condition `i >= 1 and i < 3` is false).
   - Action: `sum_1 += 2` updates `sum_1` to 4 (`2 + 2 = 4`).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, also satisfying ( 3 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `i < 5` is still true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 2` updates `sum_1` to 6 (`4 + 2 = 6`).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, now outside the previous conditions, falling into the `else` block.
   - The `else` block's action: `sum_1 *= 4` updates `sum_1` to 24 (`6 * 4 = 24`).
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `sum_1`, which is now 24.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_of_integer(5)` is 24.

[INPUT]
check_integer(4)
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function `check_integer` is called with ( i = 4 ).
`i` is 2, which doesn't satisfy ( 1 <= i < 3 ).The condition `i >= 1` and `i < 3` is False. The first branch is not taken.
i = 2 satisfies (i<2). The condition `i<5` is Ture, the second branch is taken.

Therefore, the final output of the function `check_integer(2)` is 1.

[/PYTHON]

[REASONING]
The function `split_words` is called with ( txt = "" ).
The condition " " in txt is False, and the condition ", " in txt is False.
The else branch is taken.
The function returns the length of the list of lowercase letters in txt that have an even ASCII code.

Therefore, the final output of the function `split_words("")` is 0.
