The function `string_xor` takes two strings `a` and `b` as input, and returns their bitwise XOR.
The function uses a nested loop to iterate over the characters of both strings simultaneously.
For each pair of characters `x` and `y` from the two strings, the function calls the `xor` function, which returns the bitwise XOR of `x` and `y`.
The `xor` function uses a conditional statement to check if `x` and `y` are equal.
If they are equal, the function returns '0', otherwise it returns '1'.
The outer loop iterates over the characters of both strings, and the inner loop iterates over the characters of each string.
Therefore, the function returns a string of the same length as the input strings, where each character is the bitwise XOR of the corresponding characters from the input strings.
