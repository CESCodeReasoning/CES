The function `pairs_sum_to_zero(l)` takes a list of integers `l` as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by `i` in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, `l1` is 1, `j` in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - `l1` is 1, `j` in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - `l` is [1, 3, 5, 0], `l[j]` is [3, 5, 0, 0], `l1 + l[j]` is [2, 8, 5, 0].
    - When `j` is 1 (l[j]=3), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When `j` is 2 (l[j]=5), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When `j` is 3 (l[j]=0), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is True, the if branch is taken. Return True.
    - When `j` is 4 (l[j]=0), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When `j` is 5 (l[j]=0), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, `l1` is 3, `j` in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - `l1` is 3, `j` in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - `l` is [1, 3, 5, 0], `l[j]` is [5, 0, 0, 0], `l1 + l[j]` is [4, 5, 5, 0].
    - When `j` is 2 (l[j]=5), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When `j` is 3 (l[j]=0), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is True, the if branch is taken. Return True.
    - When `j` is 4 (l[j]=0), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When `j` is 5 (l[j]=0), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, `l1` is 5, `j` in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
    - `l1` is 5, `j` in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
    - `l` is [1, 3, 5, 0], `l[j]` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `l1 + l[j]` is [5, 5, 5, 0].
    - When `j` is 3 (l[j]=0), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is True, the if branch is taken. Return True.
    - When `j` is 4 (l[j]=0), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When `j` is 5 (l[j]=0), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, `l1` is 0, `j` in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
    - `l1` is 0, `j` in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
    - `l` is [1, 3, 5, 0], `l[j]` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `l1 + l[j]` is [0, 0, 0, 0].
    - When `j` is 4 (l[j]=0), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is True, the if branch is taken. Return True.
    - When `j` is 5 (l[j]=0), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, `l1` is 0, `j` in the inner loop is 5.
    - `l1` is 0, `j` in the inner loop is 5.
    - `l` is [1, 3, 5, 0], `l[j]` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `l1 + l[j]` is [0, 0, 0, 0].
    - When `j` is 5 (l[j]=0), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is True, the if branch is taken. Return True.
No more elements to compare.
