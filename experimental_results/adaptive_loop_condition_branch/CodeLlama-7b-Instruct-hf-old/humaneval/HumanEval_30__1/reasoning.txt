The function get_positive takes a list l as input and returns a new list containing only the elements of l that are greater than 0.
To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2], we need to iterate over the list and filter out the negative elements.
Therefore, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2] is an empty list.
