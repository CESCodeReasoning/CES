The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['271', '137', '314']).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates over the elements of `lst`, which are ['271', '137', '314'].

First Iteration(arr = ['271', '137', '314']):
    `arr` is a string of digits.
    `n` is the number of odd digits in `arr`.
    `n` is calculated using the `sum` function, which returns the sum of the elements of a list.
    The `sum` function is called with a generator expression, which returns `True` if the digit is odd and `False` otherwise.
    The `sum` function returns the number of odd digits in `arr`.
    `res` is appended with the string "the number of odd elements " + str(n) + "n the str" + str(n) + "ng " + str(n) + " of the " + str(n) + "nput.".
Second Iteration(arr = ['271', '137', '314']):
    `arr` is a string of digits.
    `n` is the number of odd digits in `arr`.
    `n` is calculated using the `sum` function, which returns the sum of the elements of a list.
    The `sum` function is called with a generator expression, which returns `True` if the digit is odd and `False` otherwise.
    The `sum` function returns the number of odd digits in `arr`.
    `res` is appended with the string "the number of odd elements " + str(n) + "n the str" + str(n) + "ng " + str(n) + " of the " + str(n) + "nput.".
Third Iteration(arr = ['271', '137', '314']):
    `arr` is a string of digits.
    `n` is the number of odd digits in `arr`.
    `n` is calculated using the `sum` function, which returns the sum of the elements of a list.
    The `sum` function is called with a generator expression, which returns `True` if the digit is odd and `False` otherwise.
    The `sum` function returns the number of odd digits in `arr`.
    `res` is appended with the string "the number of odd elements " + str(n) + "n the str" + str(n) + "ng " + str(n) + " of the " + str(n) + "nput.".
After the loop completes, the function returns `res`.
