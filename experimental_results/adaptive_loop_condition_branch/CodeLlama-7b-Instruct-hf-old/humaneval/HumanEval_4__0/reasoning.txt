The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list.
To determine the output of executing the function mean_absolute_deviation on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], we need to calculate the mean of the list, which is (1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0 + 4.0) / 4 = 2.5.
Next, we need to calculate the absolute deviation of each number in the list from the mean, which is |x - mean| for each x in the list.
The absolute deviation of 1.0 from the mean is |1.0 - 2.5| = 0.5, the absolute deviation of 2.0 from the mean is |2.0 - 2.5| = 0.5, the absolute deviation of 3.0 from the mean is |3.0 - 2.5| = 0.5, and the absolute deviation of 4.0 from the mean is |4.0 - 2.5| = 1.5.
Therefore, the output of executing the function mean_absolute_deviation on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] is (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.5) / 4 = 1.25.
