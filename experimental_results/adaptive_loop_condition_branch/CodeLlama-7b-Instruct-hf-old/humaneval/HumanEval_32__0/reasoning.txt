The function `find_zero` takes a list of coefficients `xs` as input.
The function first initializes two variables `begin` and `end` to -1.0 and 1.0, respectively.
The function then enters a loop that continues until the product of the values of `poly(xs, begin)` and `poly(xs, end)` is negative.
Inside the loop, the values of `begin` and `end` are updated using the following formula: `begin *= 2.0` and `end *= 2.0`.
After the loop exits, the function enters another loop that continues until the difference between `end` and `begin` is less than 1e-10.
Inside the loop, the value of `center` is updated using the formula `(begin + end) / 2.0`.
The function then evaluates the value of `poly(xs, center)` and `poly(xs, begin)` and checks if the product of these values is negative.
If the product is negative, the value of `begin` is updated to `center`.
Otherwise, the value of `end` is updated to `center`.
After the loop exits, the function returns the value of `begin`.
