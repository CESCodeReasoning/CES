The function `numerical_letter_grade` is called with ( grades = [4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `letter_grade` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The value of `gpa` is 4.0, which satisfies ( gpa > 3.7 ).
    -The condition `gpa > 3.7` is true.
    -Action: `letter_grade.append("A+")` appends "A+" to `letter_grade`.
Iteration 2:
    -The value of `gpa` is 3, which does not satisfy ( gpa > 3.7 ).
    -The condition `gpa > 3.7` is false.
    -Action: `letter_grade.append("A")` appends "A" to `letter_grade`.
Iteration 3:
    -The value of `gpa` is 1.7, which satisfies ( gpa > 3.3 ).
    -The condition `gpa > 3.3` is true.
    -Action: `letter_grade.append("A-")` appends "A-" to `letter_grade`.
Iteration 4:
    -The value of `gpa` is 2, which does not satisfy ( gpa > 3.0 ).
    -The condition `gpa > 3.0` is false.
    -Action: `letter_grade.append("B+")` appends "B+" to `letter_grade`.
Iteration 5:
    -The value of `gpa` is 3.5, which satisfies ( gpa > 2.7 ).
    -The condition `gpa > 2.7` is true.
    -Action: `letter_grade.append("B")` appends "B" to `letter_grade`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5])` is ["A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B"].
