The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 144, b = 60 ).
Inside the function, a variable `a` is initialized to 144.
First Iteration:
    - b = 60, b is not 0.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 60, b to 44.
Second Iteration:
    - b = 44, b is not 0.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 44, b to 24.
Third Iteration:
    - b = 24, b is not 0.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 24, b to 8.
Fourth Iteration:
    - b = 8, b is not 0.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 8, b to 0.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `a`, which is now 8.
