The function `largest_divisor` is called with ( n = 3 ).
Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 3 to 0 (since ( n = 3 )).
First Iteration (i = 3)
   - `n` is 3, which is not divisible by 3.
   - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
Second Iteration (i = 2)
   - `n` is 3, which is not divisible by 2.
   - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
Third Iteration (i = 1)
   - `n` is 3, which is not divisible by 1.
   - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
Fourth Iteration (i = 0)
   - `n` is 3, which is not divisible by 0.
   - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
Since no divisor is found, the function returns 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `largest_divisor(3)` is 0.
