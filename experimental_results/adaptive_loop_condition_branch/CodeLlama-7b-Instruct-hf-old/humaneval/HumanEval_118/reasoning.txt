The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "yogurt" ).
Inside the function, a set `vowels` is created with the vowels in it.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of word is 6, so the condition (len(word) < 3) is false.
    -The loop iterates from (len(word)-2) to 0 with a step of -1.
    -The first iteration checks if the character at index 4 (i) is in vowels.
    -The character at index 4 is 'r', which is not in vowels.
    -The second condition (word[i+1] not in vowels) is true, since word[i+1] = 't' is not in vowels.
    -The third condition (word[i-1] not in vowels) is true, since word[i-1] = 'o' is not in vowels.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.

Iteration 2:
    -The character at index 3 (i) is 'g', which is not in vowels.
    -The second condition (word[i+1] not in vowels) is true, since word[i+1] = 't' is not in vowels.
    -The third condition (word[i-1] not in vowels) is true, since word[i-1] = 'o' is not in vowels.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.

Iteration 3:
    -The character at index 2 (i) is 'o', which is in vowels.
    -The second condition (word[i+1] not in vowels) is true, since word[i+1] = 'g' is not in vowels.
    -The third condition (word[i-1] not in vowels) is true, since word[i-1] = 'r' is not in vowels.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.

Iteration 4:
    -The character at index 1 (i) is 'g', which is not in vowels.
    -The second condition (word[i+1] not in vowels) is true, since word[i+1] = 't' is not in vowels.
    -The third condition (word[i-1] not in vowels) is true, since word[i-1] = 'o' is not in vowels.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.

Iteration 5:
    -The character at index 0 (i) is 'y', which is in vowels.
    -The second condition (word[i+1] not in vowels) is true, since word[i+1] = 'g' is not in vowels.
    -The third condition (word[i-1] not in vowels) is true, since word[i-1] = 'o' is not in vowels.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.

Iteration 6:
    -The character at index -1 (i) is 't', which is not in vowels.
    -The second condition (word[i+1] not in vowels) is true, since word[i+1] = 't' is not in vowels.
    -The third condition (word[i-1] not in vowels) is true, since word[i-1] = 'o' is not in vowels.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.

The loop continues until the end of the word is reached.

Therefore, the function returns the empty string "" because no vowel is found.
