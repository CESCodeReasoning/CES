The function right_angle_triangle takes three integers a, b, and c as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the three sides of a triangle can be formed with the given lengths and the triangle is a right angle triangle.

To determine the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input (7, 24, 25), we need to evaluate the following expression:

a * a == b * b + c * c or b * b == a * a + c * c or c * c == a * a + b * b

Using the values of a, b, and c from the input, we get:

7 * 7 == 24 * 24 + 25 * 25 or 24 * 24 == 7 * 7 + 25 * 25 or 25 * 25 == 7 * 7 + 24 * 24

Simplifying the expressions, we get:

49 == 676 or 676 == 49 or 625 == 676

Evaluating the expressions, we get:

False or False or True

Therefore, the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input (7, 24, 25) is True.
