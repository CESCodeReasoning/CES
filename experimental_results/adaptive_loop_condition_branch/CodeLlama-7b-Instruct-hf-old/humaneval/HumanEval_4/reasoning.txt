The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list.
To determine the output of executing the function mean_absolute_deviation on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], we need to calculate the mean of the list, which is (1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0) / 3 = 2.0.
Next, we need to calculate the absolute deviation of each number in the list from the mean, which is |x - mean| for each x in the list.
The absolute deviation of 1.0 from the mean is |1.0 - 2.0| = 1.0, the absolute deviation of 2.0 from the mean is |2.0 - 2.0| = 0.0, and the absolute deviation of 3.0 from the mean is |3.0 - 2.0| = 1.0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function mean_absolute_deviation on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] is (1.0 + 0.0 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.6666666666666666.
