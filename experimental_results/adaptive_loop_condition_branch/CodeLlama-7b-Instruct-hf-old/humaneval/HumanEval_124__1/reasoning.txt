The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '04-2003' ).
The function first tries to strip the input date of any leading or trailing whitespace.
The function then splits the input date into three parts: month, day, and year.
The function then converts each part to an integer.

The function then checks if the month is valid.
If the month is less than 1 or greater than 12, the function returns False.

The function then checks if the day is valid for the given month.
If the month is in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and the day is less than 1 or greater than 31, the function returns False.
If the month is in [4, 6, 9, 11] and the day is less than 1 or greater than 30, the function returns False.
If the month is 2 and the day is less than 1 or greater than 29, the function returns False.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('04-2003')` is True.
