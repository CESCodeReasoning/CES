The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['1234567'])
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates over the elements of `lst`
First Iteration:
    `lst` = ['1234567']
    `arr` = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7']
    `n` = sum(int(d)%2==1 for d in arr)
    `n` = 4
    `res` = ['the number of odd elements 4 in the string 4 of the input.']
Second Iteration:
    `lst` = ['1234567']
    `arr` = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7']
    `n` = sum(int(d)%2==1 for d in arr)
    `n` = 4
    `res` = ['the number of odd elements 4 in the string 4 of the input.']
Third Iteration:
    `lst` = ['1234567']
    `arr` = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7']
    `n` = sum(int(d)%2==1 for d in arr)
    `n` = 4
    `res` = ['the number of odd elements 4 in the string 4 of the input.']
Fourth Iteration:
    `lst` = ['1234567']
    `arr` = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7']
    `n` = sum(int(d)%2==1 for d in arr)
    `n` = 4
    `res` = ['the number of odd elements 4 in the string 4 of the input.']
Fifth Iteration:
    `lst` = ['1234567']
    `arr` = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7']
    `n` = sum(int(d)%2==1 for d in arr)
    `n` = 4
    `res` = ['the number of odd elements 4 in the string 4 of the input.']
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `res`, which is now ['the number of odd elements 4 in the string 4 of the input.']
