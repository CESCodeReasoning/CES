The function reverse_delete takes two arguments: a string s and a string c. It returns a tuple containing two elements: the string s with all characters in c removed, and a boolean value indicating whether the string s is a palindrome after removing the characters in c.

To determine the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcde" and "ae", we need to remove all characters in "ae" from "abcde" and check if the resulting string is a palindrome.

First, we remove all characters in "ae" from "abcde" to get "bcd".

Next, we check if "bcd" is a palindrome. Since "bcd" is not a palindrome, we return (bcd, False).

Therefore, the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcde" and "ae" is ("bcd", False).
