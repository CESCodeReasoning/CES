The function right_angle_triangle takes three sides of a triangle as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the triangle is a right angle triangle.
To determine whether a triangle is a right angle triangle, we need to check whether the sum of the squares of two sides is equal to the square of the third side.
Therefore, the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input (3, 4, 5) is True, since 3*3 + 4*4 = 5*5.
