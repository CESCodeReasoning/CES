The function `largest_prime_factor` is called with ( n = 63 ).
Inside the function, two variables `largest` and `is_prime` are defined.
The function first defines a function `is_prime` that takes an integer `k` as input and returns `True` if `k` is prime and `False` otherwise.
The function then defines a loop that iterates from 2 to `n + 1`.
For each iteration, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `j` and if `j` is prime.
If both conditions are true, the function updates `largest` to be the maximum of `largest` and `j`.
The function then returns `largest`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `largest_prime_factor(63)` is 3.
