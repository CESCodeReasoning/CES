The function `parse_nested_parens` is called with ( paren_string = '(()(())((())))' ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.
The function `parse_paren_group` is called with ( s = '(()(())((())))' ).
Inside `parse_paren_group`, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the characters in the input string.
First Iteration:
   - The character '(' is encountered, so `depth` is incremented to 1.
   - The maximum depth is updated to 1.
Second Iteration:
   - The character '(' is encountered, so `depth` is incremented to 2.
   - The maximum depth is updated to 2.
Third Iteration:
   - The character '(' is encountered, so `depth` is incremented to 3.
   - The maximum depth is updated to 3.
Fourth Iteration:
   - The character '(' is encountered, so `depth` is incremented to 4.
   - The maximum depth is updated to 4.
Fifth Iteration:
   - The character '(' is encountered, so `depth` is incremented to 5.
   - The maximum depth is updated to 5.
Sixth Iteration:
   - The character ')' is encountered, so `depth` is decremented to 4.
   - The maximum depth is updated to 4.
Seventh Iteration:
   - The character ')' is encountered, so `depth` is decremented to 3.
   - The maximum depth is updated to 3.
Eighth Iteration:
   - The character ')' is encountered, so `depth` is decremented to 2.
   - The maximum depth is updated to 2.
Ninth Iteration:
   - The character ')' is encountered, so `depth` is decremented to 1.
   - The maximum depth is updated to 1.
Tenth Iteration:
   - The character ')' is encountered, so `depth` is decremented to 0.
   - The maximum depth is updated to 0.
The function `parse_paren_group` returns the maximum depth, which is 5.
The function `parse_nested_parens` returns a list of the maximum depth for each group of parentheses in the input string.
Therefore, the final output of the function `parse_nested_parens('(()(())((())))')` is [5].
