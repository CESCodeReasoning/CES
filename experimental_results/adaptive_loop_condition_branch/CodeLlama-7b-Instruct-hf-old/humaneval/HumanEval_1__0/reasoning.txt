The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with ( paren_string = '(()(())((())))' ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.
A variable `current_string` is initialized to an empty list.
A variable `current_depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1.
    -The character '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 2.
    -The character '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 3.
    -The character '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 4.
    -The character '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 3.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 2.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 8:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 0.
    -The string in `current_string` is appended to `result`.
    -`current_string` is cleared.

Return Statement
   -After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `result`, which is now ['()(())((()))'].

Therefore, the final output of the function `separate_paren_groups('(()(())((())))')` is ['()(())((())]'.
