The function make_a_pile takes an integer n as input and returns a list of length n, where each element is the sum of n and 2 times the index of the element.
To determine the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 3, we need to calculate the list comprehension [n + 2*i for i in range(n)].
Therefore, the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 3 is [5, 7, 9].
