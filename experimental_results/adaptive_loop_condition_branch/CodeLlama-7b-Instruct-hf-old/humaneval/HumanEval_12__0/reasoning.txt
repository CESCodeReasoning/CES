The function `longest` is called with ( strings = ['x', 'y', 'z'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxlen` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of 'x' is 1, so maxlen becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The length of 'y' is 1, so maxlen becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The length of 'z' is 1, so maxlen becomes 1.

The condition `not strings` is false, so the `if` block is executed.

The `for` loop iterates over the list of strings.

Iteration 1:
    -The string 'x' is compared to maxlen, which is 1.
    -The length of 'x' is 1, so the condition is true.
    -The `return` statement is executed, returning 'x'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `longest(['x', 'y', 'z'])` is 'x'.
