The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list where the third element of each triplet is sorted.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to sort the third element of each triplet, which is [1, 2, 3].
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3].
