The function `search` is called with ( lst = [5, 5, 5, 5, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `frq` is initialized to a list of zeros with length equal to the maximum value in `lst` plus 1.

Iteration 1:
    -The value 5 is in `lst`, so `frq[5]` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The value 5 is in `lst`, so `frq[5]` becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The value 5 is in `lst`, so `frq[5]` becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The value 5 is in `lst`, so `frq[5]` becomes 4.
Iteration 5:
    -The value 1 is in `lst`, so `frq[1]` becomes 1.

The `ans` variable is initialized to -1.

Iteration 1:
    -The value 1 is not greater than or equal to the index of `frq`, so the branch is not taken.
Iteration 2:
    -The value 1 is not greater than or equal to the index of `frq`, so the branch is not taken.
Iteration 3:
    -The value 1 is not greater than or equal to the index of `frq`, so the branch is not taken.
Iteration 4:
    -The value 1 is not greater than or equal to the index of `frq`, so the branch is not taken.
Iteration 5:
    -The value 1 is greater than or equal to the index of `frq`, so the branch is taken.
    -The value of `ans` is updated to 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])` is 1.
