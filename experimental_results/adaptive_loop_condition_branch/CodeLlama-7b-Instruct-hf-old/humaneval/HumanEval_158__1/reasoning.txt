The function find_max takes a list of words as input and returns the longest word in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "enam", "game"], we need to sort the list of words based on their length and then return the first word in the sorted list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "enam", "game"] is "enam".
