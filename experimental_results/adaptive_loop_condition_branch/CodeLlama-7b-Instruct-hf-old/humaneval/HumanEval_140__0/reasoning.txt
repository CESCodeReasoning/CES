The function `fix_spaces` takes a string `text` as input and returns a new string with the spaces replaced with dashes or underscores.
The function uses a while loop to iterate through the characters in `text`.
For each character, the function checks if it is a space. If it is, the function increments the `end` variable.
If the character is not a space, the function checks if the number of spaces between the current character and the previous character is greater than 2. If it is, the function adds a dash to the new string.
If the number of spaces is greater than 0, the function adds an underscore for each space and the current character to the new string.
Finally, the function checks if the number of spaces between the last character and the end of the string is greater than 2. If it is, the function adds a dash to the new string.
