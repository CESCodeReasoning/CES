The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string that represents the sequence of numbers from 1 to n, separated by a space.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 10, we need to generate the sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 and join them with a space.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 10 is "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10".
