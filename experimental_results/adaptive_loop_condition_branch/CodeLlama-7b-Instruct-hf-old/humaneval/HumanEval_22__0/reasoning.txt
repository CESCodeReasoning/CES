The function filter_integers takes a list of values of type Any and returns a list of integers that are present in the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_integers on an empty list, we need to check if any integer is present in the input list.
Since the input list is empty, there are no integers present in the list, and therefore the output of executing the function filter_integers on an empty list is an empty list.
