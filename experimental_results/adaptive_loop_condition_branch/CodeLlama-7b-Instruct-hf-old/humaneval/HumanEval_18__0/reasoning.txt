The function `how_many_times` is called with ( string = 'xyxyxyx', substring = 'x' ).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The substring 'x' is found at index 0 in the string 'xyxyxyx'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is true.
    -Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The substring 'x' is found at index 1 in the string 'xyxyxyx'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is true.
    -Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The substring 'x' is found at index 2 in the string 'xyxyxyx'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is true.
    -Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The substring 'x' is found at index 3 in the string 'xyxyxyx'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is true.
    -Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 4.
Iteration 5:
    -The substring 'x' is found at index 4 in the string 'xyxyxyx'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is true.
    -Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 5.
Iteration 6:
    -The substring 'x' is found at index 5 in the string 'xyxyxyx'.
    -The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is true.
    -Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 6.

Therefore, the final output of the function `how_many_times('xyxyxyx', 'x')` is 6.
