The function `search` is called with ( lst = [2, 7, 8, 8, 4, 8, 7, 3, 9, 6, 5, 10, 4, 3, 6, 7, 1, 7, 4, 10, 8, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `frq` is initialized to a list of zeros with length equal to the maximum value in `lst` plus 1.

Iteration 1:
    -The value of `i` is 2, which is less than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is updated to 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The value of `i` is 7, which is less than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is updated to 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The value of `i` is 8, which is greater than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is not updated.
Iteration 4:
    -The value of `i` is 8, which is greater than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is not updated.
Iteration 5:
    -The value of `i` is 4, which is less than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is updated to 3.
Iteration 6:
    -The value of `i` is 8, which is greater than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is not updated.
Iteration 7:
    -The value of `i` is 7, which is less than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is updated to 4.
Iteration 8:
    -The value of `i` is 3, which is less than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is updated to 5.
Iteration 9:
    -The value of `i` is 9, which is greater than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is not updated.
Iteration 10:
    -The value of `i` is 6, which is less than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is updated to 6.
Iteration 11:
    -The value of `i` is 5, which is less than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is updated to 7.
Iteration 12:
    -The value of `i` is 10, which is greater than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is not updated.
Iteration 13:
    -The value of `i` is 4, which is less than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is updated to 8.
Iteration 14:
    -The value of `i` is 3, which is less than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is updated to 9.
Iteration 15:
    -The value of `i` is 6, which is less than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is updated to 10.
Iteration 16:
    -The value of `i` is 7, which is less than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is updated to 11.
Iteration 17:
    -The value of `i` is 1, which is less than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is updated to 12.
Iteration 18:
    -The value of `i` is 7, which is less than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is updated to 13.
Iteration 19:
    -The value of `i` is 4, which is less than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is updated to 14.
Iteration 20:
    -The value of `i` is 10, which is greater than the value of `frq[i]`, so `frq[i]` is not updated.

The `frq` list is now [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
