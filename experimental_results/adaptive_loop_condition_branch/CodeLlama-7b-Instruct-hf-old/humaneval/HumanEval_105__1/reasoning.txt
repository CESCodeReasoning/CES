The function `by_length` is called with an empty list (arr = []).
Inside the function, a dictionary `dic` is defined with numbers and their corresponding lengths.
The list `sorted_arr` is sorted in reverse order using the `sorted` method.
The loop iterates over the sorted list `sorted_arr`.
First Iteration:
    `var` = [] (since `sorted_arr` is empty)
    `dic[var]` is not defined since `var` is an empty list.
    The `try` block is executed and the `except` block is skipped.
    `new_arr` remains empty.
Second Iteration:
    `var` = [] (since `sorted_arr` is still empty)
    `dic[var]` is not defined since `var` is an empty list.
    The `try` block is executed and the `except` block is skipped.
    `new_arr` remains empty.
Third Iteration:
    `var` = [] (since `sorted_arr` is still empty)
    `dic[var]` is not defined since `var` is an empty list.
    The `try` block is executed and the `except` block is skipped.
    `new_arr` remains empty.
Fourth Iteration:
    `var` = [] (since `sorted_arr` is still empty)
    `dic[var]` is not defined since `var` is an empty list.
    The `try` block is executed and the `except` block is skipped.
    `new_arr` remains empty.
Fifth Iteration:
    `var` = [] (since `sorted_arr` is still empty)
    `dic[var]` is not defined since `var` is an empty list.
    The `try` block is executed and the `except` block is skipped.
    `new_arr` remains empty.
After the loop completes, the function returns an empty list.
