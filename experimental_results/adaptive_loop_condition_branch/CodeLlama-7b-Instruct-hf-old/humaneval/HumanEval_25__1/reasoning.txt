The function `factorize` is called with ( n = 3 * 19 * 3 * 19 ).
Inside the function, a variable `fact` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 2 through the square root of n (since ( n = 3 * 19 * 3 * 19 ) and ( math.sqrt(n) + 1 ) = 19).
First Iteration (i = 2):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=2 and int((math.sqrt(n) + 1))=19
    - The conditin `n % i == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`fact.append(i)` updates `fact` to [2].
    -`n //= i` updates `n` to 3 * 19 * 3.
Second Iteration (i = 3):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=3 and int((math.sqrt(n) + 1))=19
    - The conditin `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The conditin `i < n` is true. The second branch is taken.
    -`fact.append(i)` updates `fact` to [2, 3].
    -`n //= i` updates `n` to 19 * 3.
Third Iteration (i = 4):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=4 and int((math.sqrt(n) + 1))=19
    - The conditin `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The conditin `i < n` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `fact.append(i)` updates `fact` to [2, 3, 4].
    -`n //= i` updates `n` to 19.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `fact`, which is now [2, 3, 4].
