The function reverse_delete takes two arguments: s and c.
s is a string, and c is a string of characters to be deleted.
The function returns a tuple containing two elements:
1. The reversed string of s without the characters in c.
2. A boolean value indicating whether the reversed string is the same as the original string.

To determine the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcdedcba" and "v", we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to remove all the characters in "v" from "abcdedcba".
2. Then, we need to reverse the remaining string.
3. Finally, we need to check if the reversed string is the same as the original string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcdedcba" and "v" is ("edcba", False).
