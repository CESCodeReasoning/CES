The function `find_zero` takes a list of coefficients `xs` and returns the root of the polynomial equation `poly(xs, x) = 0`.
The function first initializes two variables `begin` and `end` with values -1 and 1, respectively.
The while loop iterates until the product of the values of `poly(xs, begin)` and `poly(xs, end)` is negative.
Inside the loop, the values of `begin` and `end` are updated using the following formula:
```
begin = begin * 2.0
end = end * 2.0
```
The while loop continues until the difference between `end` and `begin` is less than 1e-10.
Inside the loop, the value of `center` is calculated as the average of `begin` and `end`:
```
center = (begin + end) / 2.0
```
The function then checks if the product of the values of `poly(xs, center)` and `poly(xs, begin)` is positive or negative.
If the product is positive, the value of `begin` is updated to `center`.
Otherwise, the value of `end` is updated to `center`.
The loop continues until the difference between `end` and `begin` is less than 1e-10.
The function returns the value of `begin`.
