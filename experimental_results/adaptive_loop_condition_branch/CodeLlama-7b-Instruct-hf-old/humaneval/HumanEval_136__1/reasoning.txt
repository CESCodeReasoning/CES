The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer in the list.

The function first filters the list to get only the negative and positive integers using the built-in filter function.

The smallest negative integer is then obtained by applying the min function to the list of negative integers. If the list is empty, None is returned.

The largest positive integer is then obtained by applying the max function to the list of positive integers. If the list is empty, None is returned.

The function returns a tuple containing the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer.
