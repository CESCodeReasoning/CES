The function `count_nums` is called with ( arr = [1] ).
Inside the function, a nested function `digits_sum` is defined.
The list `arr` is passed to the nested function `digits_sum` as an argument.
The `digits_sum` function takes the argument `n` and performs the following steps:
1. If `n` is negative, it is made positive and the sign is stored in `neg`.
2. The string representation of `n` is converted to a list of integers using list comprehension.
3. The first element of the list is multiplied by `neg` and the sum of the list is calculated using the `sum` function.
4. The `digits_sum` function returns the sum of the digits of `n`.
The `count_nums` function then uses the `filter` function to filter out all the positive numbers from the list `[digits_sum(i) for i in arr]`.
The `len` function is then applied to the filtered list to get the length of the list.
The `count_nums` function returns the length of the filtered list.

Therefore, the final output of the function `count_nums([1])` is 1.
