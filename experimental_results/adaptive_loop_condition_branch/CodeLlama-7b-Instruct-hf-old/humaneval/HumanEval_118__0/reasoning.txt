The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "full" ).
Inside the function, a set `vowels` is created with the vowels in the English language.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of word is 4, so the condition (len(word) < 3) is false.
    -The for loop iterates from (len(word) - 2) to 0, with a step of -1.
    -The first iteration checks if the letter at index 2 is a vowel.
    -The letter at index 2 is "l", which is not a vowel.
    -The condition (word[i] in vowels) is false, so the branch is not taken.
Iteration 2:
    -The letter at index 1 is "f", which is not a vowel.
    -The condition (word[i] in vowels) is false, so the branch is not taken.
Iteration 3:
    -The letter at index 0 is "f", which is not a vowel.
    -The condition (word[i] in vowels) is false, so the branch is not taken.

Therefore, the function returns an empty string.
