The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "2 apples and 3 oranges", n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `lis` is initialized to an empty list.
The string `s` is split into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter.
The list of words is then iterated over.
First Iteration (i = "2")
   - The string "2" is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - The branch `taken` is not taken.
Second Iteration (i = "apples")
   - The string "apples" is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - The branch `taken` is not taken.
Third Iteration (i = "and")
   - The string "and" is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - The branch `taken` is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (i = "3")
   - The string "3" is a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is true.
   - The branch `taken` is taken.
Fifth Iteration (i = "oranges")
   - The string "oranges" is a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is true.
   - The branch `taken` is taken.
The list `lis` is then returned.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges",5)` is 2.
