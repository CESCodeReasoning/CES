The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -4, 5, 6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `op` is 1, so `balance` becomes 1.
    - The condition `balance < 0` is false.
    - Action: `return False` is executed.

Iteration 2:
    - `op` is 2, so `balance` becomes 3.
    - The condition `balance < 0` is false.
    - Action: `return False` is executed.

Iteration 3:
    - `op` is -4, so `balance` becomes -3.
    - The condition `balance < 0` is true.
    - Action: `return True` is executed.

Therefore, the final output of the function `below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5, 6])` is True.
