The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a new list with the third element of l sorted.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], we need to sort the third element of the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] is [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, -10, 1, 123].
