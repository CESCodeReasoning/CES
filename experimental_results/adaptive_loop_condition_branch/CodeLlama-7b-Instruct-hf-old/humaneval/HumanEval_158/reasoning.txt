The function find_max takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "of", "string"], we need to sort the list of strings based on their length and then return the first element of the sorted list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "of", "string"] is "string".
