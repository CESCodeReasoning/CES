The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 10, b = 15 ).
Inside the function, a variable `a` is initialized to 10.
First Iteration:
    - b = 15, b % a = 0.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 15 and b to 0.
Second Iteration:
    - b = 0, b % a = 0.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 0 and b to 0.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `a`, which is now 0.
