The function `factorize` is called with ( n = 3 * 2 * 3 ).
Inside the function, a variable `fact` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 2 through the square root of n (since ( n = 3 * 2 * 3 ) and ( math.sqrt(n) + 1 ) = 4 ).
First Iteration (i = 2):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=2 and (math.sqrt(n) + 1) = 4
    - The conditin `n % i == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`fact.append(i)` updates `fact` to [2].
    -`n //= i` updates `n` to 3 * 2 * 3 // 2 = 3 * 2 = 6.
Second Iteration (i = 3):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=3 and (math.sqrt(n) + 1) = 4
    - The conditin `n % i == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`fact.append(i)` updates `fact` to [2, 3].
    -`n //= i` updates `n` to 3 * 2 * 3 // 3 = 3 * 2 = 6.
Third Iteration (i = 4):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=4 and (math.sqrt(n) + 1) = 4
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `i < n` is true. The second branch is taken.
    -`fact.append(i)` updates `fact` to [2, 3, 4].
    -`n //= i` updates `n` to 3 * 2 * 3 // 4 = 3 * 2 = 6.
Fourth Iteration (i = 5):
    - i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) when i=5 and (math.sqrt(n) + 1) = 4
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `i < n` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `fact.append(n)` updates `fact` to [2, 3, 4, 5].
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `fact`, which is now [2, 3, 4, 5].
