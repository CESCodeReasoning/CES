[INPUT]
find_all_duplicate([3, 5, 4, 3, 7, 4])
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function find_all_duplicate(numbers) takes a list of numbers([3, 5, 4, 3, 7, 4]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterats through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=3: compare with 5, 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 1 (numbers[j]=5), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 3 to duplicates.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken. 
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=5: compare with 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=4: compare with 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 4 to duplicates
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=3, Compare with 7, 4:
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - numbers[i] = 7, compare with 4:
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.

    return False

[REASONING]
The function has_close_elements(numbers, threshold) takes a list of numbers([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1]) and a threshold(0.5) as its parameters.
The outer loop iterats through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by idx in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (idx=0):
    - `idx` is 0, `elem` is 1.1, `idx2` in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - `elem2` in the inner loop is 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1:
        - When `idx2` = 1 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` = 2 (elem2=3.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` = 3 (elem2=4.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` = 4 (elem2=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (idx=1):
    - `idx` is 1, `elem` is 2.2, `idx2` in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - `elem2` in the inner loop is 3.1, 4.1, 5.1:
        - When `idx2` = 2 (elem2=3.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` = 3 (elem2=4.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` = 4 (elem2=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (idx=2):
    - `idx` is 2, `elem` is 3.1, `idx2` in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
    - `elem2` in the inner loop is 4.1, 5.1:
        - When `idx2` = 3 (elem2=4.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` = 4 (elem2=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (idx=3):
    - `idx` is 3, `elem` is 4.1, `idx2` in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
    - `elem2` in the inner loop is 5.1:
        - When `idx2` = 4 (elem2=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (idx=4):
    - `idx` is 4, `elem` is 5.1, `idx2` in the inner loop is 5.
    - `elem2` in the inner loop is 5.1:
        - When `idx2` = 5 (elem2=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (idx=5):
    No more elements to compare.
