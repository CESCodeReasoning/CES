The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with all duplicates removed.
To determine the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5], we need to remove the duplicates from the input list.
The input list contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, and 5.
The first step is to count the frequency of each number in the input list using a collections.Counter object.
The Counter object returns a dictionary with the number of occurrences of each number in the input list.
The dictionary is {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1}.
The next step is to create a new list with all the numbers that appear only once in the input list.
The new list is [1, 2, 4, 5].
Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5] is [1, 2, 4, 5].
