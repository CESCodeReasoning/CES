You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    import collections
    c = collections.Counter(numbers)
    return [n for n in numbers if c[n] <= 1]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [ANSWER]
The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with all duplicates removed.
To determine the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5], we need to remove the duplicates from the input list.
The input list contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, and 5.
The first step is to count the frequency of each number in the input list using a collections.Counter object.
The Counter object returns a dictionary with the number of occurrences of each number in the input list.
The dictionary is {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1}.
The next step is to create a new list with all the numbers that appear only once in the input list.
The new list is [1, 2, 4, 5].
Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5] is [1, 2, 4, 5].
