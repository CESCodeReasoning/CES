The function `minPath` takes a grid and a number k as its parameters.
The function first initializes a variable `val` to the maximum value of the grid plus 1.
The outer loop iterates through each row of the grid.
In the inner loop, the function iterates through each column of the grid.
For each element in the grid, the function checks if the element is equal to 1.
If the element is equal to 1, the function appends the minimum value of the elements in the same row and column to a temporary list `temp`.
The function then sets the value of `val` to the minimum value of `temp`.
The function then initializes a list `ans` to the same length as `k`.
The function then iterates through each element in `k`.
If the element is even, the function appends 1 to `ans`.
Otherwise, the function appends the value of `val` to `ans`.
Finally, the function returns `ans`.
