The function `compare_one` is called with ( a = 5, b = 6 ).
`a` and `b` are both integers, so the first two if conditions are not met.
The third if condition is met, since `float(5) == float(6)` is `True`.
Therefore, the method returns `None`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one(5, 6)` is `None`.
