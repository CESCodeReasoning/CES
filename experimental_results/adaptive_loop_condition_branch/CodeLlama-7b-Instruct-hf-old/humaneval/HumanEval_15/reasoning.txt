The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string that represents the sequence of numbers from 0 to n, separated by a space.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 0, we need to generate the sequence of numbers from 0 to 0, which is just the number 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 0 is "0".
