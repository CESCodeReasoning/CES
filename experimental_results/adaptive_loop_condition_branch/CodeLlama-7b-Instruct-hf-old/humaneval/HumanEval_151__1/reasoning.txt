The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of all the positive numbers in the list that are not divisible by 2 and do not contain a decimal point.
To determine the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [], we need to follow the steps below:

1. The function first iterates over the list and checks if each element is positive, divisible by 2, and does not contain a decimal point.
2. Since the input list is empty, there are no elements in the list that satisfy the conditions, so the function returns 0.

Therefore, the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [] is 0.
