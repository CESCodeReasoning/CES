The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The function first creates a list A of size n, where A[i] = i*i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1).
The function then initializes an empty list ans.
The function then iterates through each element in the list A, starting from the first element.
For each element A[i] in A, the function iterates through each element in the list A starting from the element after A[i].
For each element A[j] in A starting from the element after A[i], the function iterates through each element in the list A starting from the element after A[j].
For each element A[k] in A starting from the element after A[j], the function checks if (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0.
If the condition is True, the function appends (A[i], A[j], A[k]) to the list ans.
The function then returns the length of the list ans.
