The function first splits the input string into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter. The last element of the list is then retrieved using the [-1] index.

The check variable is then assigned the value of the last character of the input string.

The function then checks if the length of the check variable is equal to 1 and if the character is a letter. If the condition is true, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.

[CONDITION]
The condition is that the length of the check variable is equal to 1 and if the character is a letter.

[BRANCH]
The branch is hit if the length of the check variable is equal to 1 and if the character is a letter.
