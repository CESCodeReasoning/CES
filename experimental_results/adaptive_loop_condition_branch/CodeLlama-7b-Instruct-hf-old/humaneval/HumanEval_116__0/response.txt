You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def sort_array(arr):
    return sorted(sorted(arr), key=lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1'))
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sort_array([3,6,44,12,32,5])
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [ANSWER]
The function sort_array takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted array of integers.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [3,6,44,12,32,5], we need to sort the array first.
The sorted array is [3,5,12,32,44,6].
Next, we need to sort the sorted array again using a custom key function.
The custom key function is lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1').
The key function takes each element x of the sorted array and returns the number of 1s in the binary representation of x.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [3,6,44,12,32,5] is [3,5,12,32,44,6].
