The function `sort_even` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3] ).
Inside the function, two variables `evens` and `odds` are initialized to the even and odd elements of the list `l` respectively.
The even elements of `l` are extracted using slicing ( `l[::2]` ).
The odd elements of `l` are extracted using slicing ( `l[1::2]` ).
The even elements are sorted using the `sort` method.
The `zip` function is used to combine the sorted even elements with the odd elements.
The resulting list is created by iterating over the zipped elements and appending them to the `ans` list.
If the number of even elements is greater than the number of odd elements, the last even element is appended to the `ans` list.
The function returns the `ans` list.
