The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 to (len(arr) // 2) - 1.
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `arr[i]` is 1, which is equal to `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]`.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains 0.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `arr[i]` is 2, which is not equal to `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]`.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans` is updated to 1.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `arr[i]` is 3, which is not equal to `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]`.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans` is updated to 2.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `arr[i]` is 5, which is not equal to `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]`.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans` is updated to 3.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `arr[i]` is 4, which is not equal to `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]`.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans` is updated to 4.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `arr[i]` is 7, which is not equal to `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]`.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans` is updated to 5.
Seventh Iteration (i = 6)
   - `arr[i]` is 9, which is not equal to `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]`.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans` is updated to 6.
Eighth Iteration (i = 7)
   - `arr[i]` is 6, which is not equal to `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]`.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans` is updated to 7.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is now 7.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6])` is 7.
