The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'a b b a' ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `dict1` is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The input string is split into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter.
The list of words is stored in the variable `list1`.
The variable `t` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first word in the list is 'a'.
    -The word 'a' is not empty, so the condition (list1.count(i)>t) is true.
    -The condition (i!='') is true.
    -The condition (list1.count(i)>t) is true.
