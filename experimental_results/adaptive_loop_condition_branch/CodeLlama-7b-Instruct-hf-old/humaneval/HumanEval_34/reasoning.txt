The function unique takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of unique elements in l.
To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], we need to remove the duplicates from the list and then sort the remaining elements.
Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123] is [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123].
