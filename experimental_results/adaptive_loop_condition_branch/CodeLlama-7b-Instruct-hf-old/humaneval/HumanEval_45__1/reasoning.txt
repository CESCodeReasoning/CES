The function triangle_area takes two arguments a and h, which are the length and height of a triangle, respectively. The function returns the area of the triangle, which is calculated by multiplying the length and height and then dividing the result by 2.0.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (2, 2), we need to calculate the area of the triangle. The area of a triangle is calculated by multiplying the length and height and then dividing the result by 2.0. Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (2, 2) is 1.0.
