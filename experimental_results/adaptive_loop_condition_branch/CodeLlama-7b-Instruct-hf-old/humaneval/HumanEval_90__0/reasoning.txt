The function next_smallest takes a list of integers lst as input and returns the next smallest element in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [5, 1, 4, 3, 2], we need to follow these steps:

1. Sort the list of integers lst to get a sorted list of unique elements.
[STATE] lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] [/STATE]
2. Check if the length of the sorted list is less than 2. If it is, then there is no next smallest element, so return None.
[CONDITION] len(lst) < 2 [/CONDITION]
[BRANCH] N [/BRANCH]
3. If the length of the sorted list is greater than or equal to 2, then return the second element of the sorted list.
[STATE] lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] [/STATE]
[OUTPUT] 2 [/OUTPUT]
