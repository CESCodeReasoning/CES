The function `words_string` is called with ( s = "Hi, my name is John" ).
Inside the function, a variable `s_list` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'H' is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character 'H' is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'i' is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character 'i' is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ',' is equal to ',', so the `if` block is executed.
    -A space is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character ' ' (space) is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 'm' is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character 'm' is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character 'y' is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character 'y' is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character ' ' (space) is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 8:
    -The character 'n' is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character 'n' is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 9:
    -The character 'a' is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character 'a' is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 10:
    -The character 'm' is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character 'm' is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 11:
    -The character 'e' is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character 'e' is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 12:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character ' ' (space) is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 13:
    -The character 'i' is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character 'i' is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 14:
    -The character 's' is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character 's' is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 15:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character ' ' (space) is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 16:
    -The character 'J' is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character 'J' is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 17:
    -The character 'o' is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character 'o' is added to `s_list`.
Iteration 18:
    -The character 'h' is not equal to ',', so the `else` block is executed.
    -The character 'h' is added to `s_list`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the list `s_list`.
