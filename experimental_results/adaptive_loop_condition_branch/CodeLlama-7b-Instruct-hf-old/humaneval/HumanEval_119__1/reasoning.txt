The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['(()(())', '())())'] ).
Inside the function, two variables `S1` and `S2` are defined.

Iteration 1:
    - `S1` is assigned the value '(()(())' + '())' = '(()(())()'
    - `S2` is assigned the value '(()(())' + '())' = '(()(())()'
Iteration 2:
    - `S1` is assigned the value '(()(())()' + '()' = '(()(())()()'
    - `S2` is assigned the value '(()(())()' + '()' = '(()(())()()'
Iteration 3:
    - `S1` is assigned the value '(()(())()()' + '()' = '(()(())()()()'
    - `S2` is assigned the value '(()(())()()' + '()' = '(()(())()()()'
Iteration 4:
    - `S1` is assigned the value '(()(())()()()' + '()' = '(()(())()()()()'
    - `S2` is assigned the value '(()(())()()()' + '()' = '(()(())()()()()'
Iteration 5:
    - `S1` is assigned the value '(()(())()()()()' + '()' = '(()(())()()()()()'
    - `S2` is assigned the value '(()(())()()()()' + '()' = '(()(())()()()()()'

The function then checks if either `S1` or `S2` is a valid parenthesis expression.

The function `check` is called with ( s = '(()(())()()()()' ).
Inside the function, a variable `val` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `val` is 0
    - `i` is '('
    - `val` is 1
Iteration 2:
    - `val` is 1
    - `i` is '('
    - `val` is 2
Iteration 3:
    - `val` is 2
    - `i` is '('
    - `val` is 3
Iteration 4:
    - `val` is 3
    - `i` is '('
    - `val` is 4
Iteration 5:
    - `val` is 4
    - `i` is '('
    - `val` is 5
Iteration 6:
    - `val` is 5
    - `i` is ')'
    - `val` is 4
Iteration 7:
    - `val` is 4
    - `i` is ')'
    - `val` is 3
Iteration 8:
    - `val` is 3
    - `i` is ')'
    - `val` is 2
Iteration 9:
    - `val` is 2
    - `i` is ')'
    - `val` is 1
Iteration 10:
    - `val` is 1
    - `i` is ')'
    - `val` is 0

The function returns `True` if `val` is 0, otherwise it returns `False`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `match_parens(['(()(())', '())())'])` is 'Yes'.
