The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = '[[]]' ).
Inside the function, three variables are initialized: `opening_bracket_index`, `closing_bracket_index`, and `cnt`.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '[' is pushed into `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '[' is pushed into `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ']' is pushed into `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ']' is pushed into `closing_bracket_index`.

After the loop, `opening_bracket_index` contains [0, 1] and `closing_bracket_index` contains [2, 3].

The `closing_bracket_index` is reversed.

The `cnt` variable is initialized to 0.

The `i` variable is initialized to 0.

The `l` variable is initialized to the length of `closing_bracket_index`.

The `for` loop iterates over `opening_bracket_index`.

Iteration 1:
    -The `idx` variable is set to 0.
    -The `if` condition is checked: (i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i]).
    -The `if` condition is true, so the `if` block is executed.
    -The `cnt` variable is incremented by 1.
    -The `i` variable is incremented by 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The `idx` variable is set to 1.
    -The `if` condition is checked: (i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i]).
    -The `if` condition is true, so the `if` block is executed.
    -The `cnt` variable is incremented by 1.
    -The `i` variable is incremented by 1.

After the loop, `cnt` is 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_nested('[[]]')` is `True`.
