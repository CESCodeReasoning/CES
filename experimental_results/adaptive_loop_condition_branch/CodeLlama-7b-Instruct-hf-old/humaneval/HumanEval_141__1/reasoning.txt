The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = '@this1_is6_valid.exe' ).
The function first splits the file name into a list of strings using the separator '.'.
The list is then checked for length.
If the length of the list is not 2, then the method returns 'No'.
The second element of the list is then checked to see if it is in the list suf.
If the second element is not in suf, then the method returns 'No'.
The first element of the list is then checked to see if it is empty.
If the first element is empty, then the method returns 'No'.
The first character of the first element is then checked to see if it is a letter.
If the first character is not a letter, then the method returns 'No'.
The number of digits in the first element is then counted.
If the number of digits in the first element is greater than 3, then the method returns 'No'.
Otherwise, the method returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `file_name_check('@this1_is6_valid.exe')` is 'Yes'.
