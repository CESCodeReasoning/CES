The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] ).
Inside the function, a function `isPrime` is defined.
The variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through the length of the list (since ( i < len(lst) )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The else branch is taken. `maxx` remains 0.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The if branch is taken. `maxx` becomes 3.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The else branch is taken. `maxx` remains 3.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The else branch is taken. `maxx` remains 3.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The if branch is taken. `maxx` becomes 5.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The if branch is taken. `maxx` becomes 7.
Seventh Iteration (i = 6):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The else branch is taken. `maxx` remains 7.
Eighth Iteration (i = 7):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The if branch is taken. `maxx` becomes 9.
Ninth Iteration (i = 8):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The else branch is taken. `maxx` remains 9.
Tenth Iteration (i = 9):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The if branch is taken. `maxx` becomes 11.
Eleventh Iteration (i = 10):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The else branch is taken. `maxx` remains 11.
Twelfth Iteration (i = 11):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The if branch is taken. `maxx` becomes 13.
Thirteenth Iteration (i = 12):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The else branch is taken. `maxx` remains 13.
Fourteenth Iteration (i = 13):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The if branch is taken. `maxx` becomes 15.
Fifteenth Iteration (i = 14):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The else branch is taken. `maxx` remains 15.
Sixteenth Iteration (i = 15):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The if branch is taken. `maxx` becomes 17.
Seventeenth Iteration (i = 16):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The else branch is taken. `maxx` remains 17.
Eighteenth Iteration (i = 17):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The if branch is taken. `maxx` becomes 19.
Nineteenth Iteration (i = 18):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The else branch is taken. `maxx` remains 19.
Twentieth Iteration (i = 19):
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The if branch is taken. `maxx` becomes 21.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `maxx`, which is now 21.
