The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 33, y = 12354 ).
The condition `x > y` is false, therefore the first if branch is not taken.
The condition `y % 2 == 0` is true, therefore the second if branch is taken and the method returns y.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(33, 12354)` is 12354.
