The function `any_int` is called with ( x = 3, y = 4, z = 7 ).
`x`, `y`, and `z` are all integers, which satisfies (isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int)).
The condition (x + y == z) or (x + z == y) or (y + z == x) is evaluated.
The first condition is False, the second condition is True, and the third condition is False.
Therefore, the final output of the function `any_int(3,4,7)` is False.
