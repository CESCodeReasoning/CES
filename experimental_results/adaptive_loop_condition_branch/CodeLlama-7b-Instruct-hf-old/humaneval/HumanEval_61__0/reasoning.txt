The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = ")((" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character ')' is not a left bracket, so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is a left bracket, so depth becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is a left bracket, so depth becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is not a left bracket, so depth becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '(' is a left bracket, so depth becomes 3.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ')' is not a left bracket, so depth becomes 2.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `depth`, which is 2.
