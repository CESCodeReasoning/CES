The function find_max takes a list of words as input and returns the word that appears most frequently in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["play", "this", "game", "of","footbott"], we need to find the word that appears most frequently in the list.
The word "game" appears twice in the list, while the words "play", "this", and "footbott" appear only once. Therefore, the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["play", "this", "game", "of","footbott"] is "game".
