The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "bye" ).
The variable `vowels` is initialized to "aeiouAEIOU".
The loop iterates over the characters in `s`.
First Iteration (c = "b")
   - `c` is "b", which is not in `vowels`.
   - The condition `c in vowels` is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels` remains 0.
Second Iteration (c = "y")
   - `c` is "y", which is in `vowels`.
   - The condition `c in vowels` is true.
   - Action: `n_vowels` is updated to 1.
Third Iteration (c = "e")
   - `c` is "e", which is not in `vowels`.
   - The condition `c in vowels` is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels` remains 1.
Fourth Iteration (c = "")
   - `c` is "", which is not in `vowels`.
   - The condition `c in vowels` is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels` remains 1.
Fifth Iteration (c = "")
   - `c` is "", which is not in `vowels`.
   - The condition `c in vowels` is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels` remains 1.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `n_vowels`, which is now 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("bye")` is 1.
