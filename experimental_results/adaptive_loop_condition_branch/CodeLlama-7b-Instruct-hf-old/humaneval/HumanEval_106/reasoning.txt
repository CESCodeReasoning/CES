The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The function returns a list of integers.
The list contains the factorial of n.
The factorial of n is calculated using the formula: n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 1.
The function uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to n+1.
For each iteration, the function checks if the current number is even.
If the current number is even, the function calculates the factorial of the current number using the formula.
If the current number is odd, the function calculates the sum of the factorial of the current number and 1.
The function returns the list of factorials.
