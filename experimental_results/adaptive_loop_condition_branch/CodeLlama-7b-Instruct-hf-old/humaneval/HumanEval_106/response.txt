[INPUT]
find_all_duplicate([3, 5, 4, 3, 7, 4])
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function find_all_duplicate(numbers) takes a list of numbers([3, 5, 4, 3, 7, 4]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterats through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=3: compare with 5, 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 1 (numbers[j]=5), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 3 to duplicates.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken. 
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=5: compare with 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=4: compare with 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 4 to duplicates
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=3, Compare with 7, 4:
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - numbers[i] = 7, compare with 4:
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.

[REASONING]
The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The function returns a list of integers.
The list contains the factorial of n.
The factorial of n is calculated using the formula: n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 1.
The function uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to n+1.
For each iteration, the function checks if the current number is even.
If the current number is even, the function calculates the factorial of the current number using the formula.
If the current number is odd, the function calculates the sum of the factorial of the current number and 1.
The function returns the list of factorials.
