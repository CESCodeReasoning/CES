The function select_words(s, n) takes a string s and an integer n as its parameters.
The function splits the string s into a list of words using the split() method.
The outer loop iterates through each word in the list of words.
The inner loop iterates through each character in the word.
The condition checks if the character is a consonant (not in the list of vowels ["a","e","i","o","u"]).
If the character is a consonant, the counter n_consonants is incremented.
If the counter n_consonants is equal to n, the word is added to the result list.
