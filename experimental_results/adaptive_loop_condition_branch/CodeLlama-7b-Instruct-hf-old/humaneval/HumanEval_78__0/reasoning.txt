The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "2020" ).
Inside the function, a variable `primes` is initialized to ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D').
The loop iterates from 0 to the length of `num` (which is 4).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `num[i]` is '2', which is in `primes`.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total` is incremented by 1.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `num[i]` is '0', which is not in `primes`.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - Action: `total` is not changed.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `num[i]` is '2', which is in `primes`.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total` is incremented by 1.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `num[i]` is '0', which is not in `primes`.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - Action: `total` is not changed.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `total`, which is 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `hex_key("2020")` is 2.
