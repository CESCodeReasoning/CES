The function `is_multiply_prime` takes an integer `a` as its parameter.
The function first defines a nested function `is_prime` that takes an integer `n` as its parameter.
The `is_prime` function checks if `n` is prime by iterating from 2 to `n-1` and checking if `n` is divisible by any number between 2 and `n-1`. If `n` is not divisible by any number between 2 and `n-1`, then it must be prime.

The outer function `is_multiply_prime` also takes an integer `a` as its parameter.
The outer function iterates from 2 to 100 and checks if each number is prime. If a number is prime, then it checks if any of the numbers 2 to 100 are prime. If any of the numbers 2 to 100 are prime, then it checks if any of the numbers 2 to 100 are prime. If any of the numbers 2 to 100 are prime, then it checks if `i * j * k == a` is true. If `i * j * k == a` is true, then the function returns True.

The function returns False if none of the conditions are met.
