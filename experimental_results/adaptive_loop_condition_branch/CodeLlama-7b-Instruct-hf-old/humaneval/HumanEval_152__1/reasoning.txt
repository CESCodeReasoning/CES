The function compare takes two lists, game and guess, as input and returns a list of the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of the two lists.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input ([0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0]), we need to calculate the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of the two lists.
Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input ([0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0]) is [0,0,0,0,0,0].
