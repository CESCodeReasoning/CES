The function `total_match` is called with ( lst1 = ['4'], lst2 = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'] ).
Inside the function, two variables `l1` and `l2` are initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 1 (since ( len(lst1) = 1 )).
First Iteration (st = '4'):
    `l1 += len(st)` updates `l1` to 4 ( 0 + 4 = 4 ).
Second Iteration (st = '1'):
    `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 5 ( 4 + 1 = 5 ).
Third Iteration (st = '2'):
    `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 6 ( 5 + 2 = 6 ).
Fourth Iteration (st = '3'):
    `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 7 ( 6 + 3 = 7 ).
Fifth Iteration (st = '4'):
    `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 8 ( 7 + 4 = 8 ).
Fifth Iteration (st = '5'):
    `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 9 ( 8 + 5 = 9 ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( l1 <= l2 ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `lst1` as the output.
