The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None.
The loop iterates over the list `numbers`.
First Iteration (n = 1)
   - `running_max` is None, so it is set to 1.
   - The result list `result` is appended with 1.
Second Iteration (n = 2)
   - `running_max` is 1, so it is compared to 2.
   - The maximum of 1 and 2 is 2, so `running_max` is updated to 2.
   - The result list `result` is appended with 2.
Third Iteration (n = 3)
   - `running_max` is 2, so it is compared to 3.
   - The maximum of 2 and 3 is 3, so `running_max` is updated to 3.
   - The result list `result` is appended with 3.
Fourth Iteration (n = 4)
   - `running_max` is 3, so it is compared to 4.
   - The maximum of 3 and 4 is 4, so `running_max` is updated to 4.
   - The result list `result` is appended with 4.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `result`, which is [1, 2, 3, 4].

Therefore, the final output of the function `rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 4])` is [1, 2, 3, 4].
