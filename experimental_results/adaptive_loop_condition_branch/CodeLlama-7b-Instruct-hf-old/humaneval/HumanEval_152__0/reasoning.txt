The function compare takes two lists, game and guess, as input and returns a list of the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of the two lists.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input ([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4]), we need to calculate the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of the two lists.
Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input ([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4]) is [2,1,0,1].
