The function `sum_product` is called with (numbers = [100, 0]).
Inside the function, two variables `sum_value` and `prod_value` are initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the list `numbers` which has two elements.

First Iteration(n = 100):
    `sum_value` = 0 + 100 = 100
    `prod_value` = 1 * 100 = 100
Second Iteration(n = 0):
    `sum_value` = 100 + 0 = 100
    `prod_value` = 100 * 0 = 0

After the loop completes, the function returns a tuple containing the sum and product of the elements in the list.
