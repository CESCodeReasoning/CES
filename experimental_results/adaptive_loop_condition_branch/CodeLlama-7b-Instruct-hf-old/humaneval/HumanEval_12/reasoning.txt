The function `longest` is called with ( strings = ['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxlen` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of 'x' is 1, so maxlen becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The length of 'yyy' is 3, so maxlen becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The length of 'zzzz' is 4, so maxlen becomes 4.
Iteration 4:
    -The length of 'www' is 3, so maxlen becomes 4.
Iteration 5:
    -The length of 'kkkk' is 4, so maxlen becomes 4.
Iteration 6:
    -The length of 'abc' is 3, so maxlen becomes 4.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `maxlen`, which is 4.
