The function filter_by_substring takes two arguments: a list of strings (strings) and a string (substring). It returns a new list containing all the strings in the original list that contain the substring.

To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'aaaxxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xx', we need to apply the filter to each string in the list.

The first string in the list is 'xxx'. It contains the substring 'xx', so it is included in the output.
The second string in the list is 'asd'. It does not contain the substring 'xx', so it is excluded from the output.
The third string in the list is 'aaaxxy'. It contains the substring 'xx', so it is included in the output.
The fourth string in the list is 'john doe'. It does not contain the substring 'xx', so it is excluded from the output.
The fifth string in the list is 'xxxAAA'. It contains the substring 'xx', so it is included in the output.
The sixth string in the list is 'xxx'. It contains the substring 'xx', so it is included in the output.

Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'aaaxxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xx' is ['xxx', 'aaaxxy', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'].
