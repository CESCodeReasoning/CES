The function `even_odd_count` is called with ( num = 7 ).
Inside the function, two variables `even_count` and `odd_count` are initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the digits of the absolute value of `num` (since `num` is a positive integer).
First Iteration (i = 7)
   - `i` is 7, which is an odd number.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 1.
Second Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is true.
   - Action: `even_count += 1` updates `even_count` to 1.
Third Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is true.
   - Action: `even_count += 1` updates `even_count` to 2.
Fourth Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is true.
   - Action: `even_count += 1` updates `even_count` to 3.
Fifth Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is true.
   - Action: `even_count += 1` updates `even_count` to 4.
Sixth Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is true.
   - Action: `even_count += 1` updates `even_count` to 5.
Seventh Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is true.
   - Action: `even_count += 1` updates `even_count` to 6.
Eighth Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is true.
   - Action: `even_count += 1` updates `even_count` to 7.
Ninth Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is true.
   - Action: `even_count += 1` updates `even_count` to 8.
Tenth Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is true.
   - Action: `even_count += 1` updates `even_count` to 9.
Eleventh Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is true.
   - Action: `even_count += 1` updates `even_count` to 10.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the tuple `(even_count, odd_count)`, which is (10, 1) in this case.

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_count(7)` is (10, 1).
