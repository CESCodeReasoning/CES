The function `split_words` is called with ( txt = "Hello world,!" ).
The condition " " in txt is False, so the first branch is not taken.
The condition "," in txt is True, so the second branch is taken.
The function returns the result of `txt.replace(',', ' ').split()`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `split_words("Hello world,!")` is ["Hello", "world", "!"].
