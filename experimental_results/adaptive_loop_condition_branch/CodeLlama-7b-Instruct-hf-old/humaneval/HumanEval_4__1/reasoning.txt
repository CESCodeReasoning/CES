The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list.
To determine the output of executing the function mean_absolute_deviation on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], we need to calculate the mean of the list and then calculate the absolute deviation of each number from the mean.
The mean of the list is (1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0 + 4.0 + 5.0) / 5 = 3.0.
The absolute deviation of each number from the mean is |x - mean| = |x - 3.0| for x in [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0].
Therefore, the output of executing the function mean_absolute_deviation on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] is (|1.0 - 3.0| + |2.0 - 3.0| + |3.0 - 3.0| + |4.0 - 3.0| + |5.0 - 3.0|) / 5 = 2.0.
