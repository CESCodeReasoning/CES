The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [12345, 2033, 111, 151] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_digit_elements` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 12345 is a 5-digit number, and all its digits are odd (1, 3, 5).
    -The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is true, so the number is added to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 2033 is a 4-digit number, and all its digits are odd (2, 0, 3, 3).
    -The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is true, so the number is added to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 111 is a 3-digit number, and all its digits are odd (1, 1, 1).
    -The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is true, so the number is added to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 151 is a 3-digit number, and all its digits are odd (1, 5, 1).
    -The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is true, so the number is added to `odd_digit_elements`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `unique_digits([12345, 2033, 111, 151])` is [12345, 111, 151].
