The function `sort_even` is called with ( l = [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] ).
Inside the function, two variables `evens` and `odds` are initialized to the even and odd elements of the list `l` respectively.
The even elements are extracted from the list `l` using slicing ( `evens = l[::2]` ).
The odd elements are extracted from the list `l` using slicing ( `odds = l[1::2]` ).
The even elements are sorted using the `sort` method ( `evens.sort()` ).
The even and odd elements are zipped together using the `zip` function ( `zip(evens, odds)` ).
The resulting list is then created by iterating over the zipped elements and appending them to the list `ans` ( `for e, o in zip(evens, odds): ans.extend([e, o])` ).
If the length of the even elements is greater than the length of the odd elements, then the last element of the even elements is appended to the list `ans` ( `if len(evens) > len(odds): ans.append(evens[-1])` ).
The function returns the list `ans` as the output.
