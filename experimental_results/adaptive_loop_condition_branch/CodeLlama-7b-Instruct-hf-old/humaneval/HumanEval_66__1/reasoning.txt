The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "aAaaaXa" ).
The condition `s == ""` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The return statement returns the sum of the ordinal values of the characters in `s` that are uppercase, which is 194.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digitSum("aAaaaXa")` is 194.
