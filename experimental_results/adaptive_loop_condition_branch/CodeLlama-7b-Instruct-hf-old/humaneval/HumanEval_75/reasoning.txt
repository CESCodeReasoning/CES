The function `is_multiply_prime` takes an integer `a` as its parameter.
The function first defines a nested function `is_prime` that takes an integer `n` as its parameter.
The `is_prime` function checks if `n` is prime by iterating from 2 to `n-1` and checking if `n` is divisible by any number between 2 and `n-1`. If `n` is not divisible by any number between 2 and `n-1`, then it must be prime.

The outer function `is_multiply_prime` also takes an integer `a` as its parameter.
The outer function iterates from 2 to 100 and checks if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function.
If a number is prime, the outer function checks if it is a factor of `a` by multiplying it with other prime numbers between 2 and 100. If `a` is a factor of a prime number, then it must be a multiply prime number.

The function returns `True` if `a` is a multiply prime number, and `False` otherwise.
