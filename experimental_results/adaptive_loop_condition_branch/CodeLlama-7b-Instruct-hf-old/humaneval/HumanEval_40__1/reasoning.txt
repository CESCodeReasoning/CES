The function triples_sum_to_zero(l) takes a list of numbers l as its parameter.
The outer loop iterats through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - l[i]=2: compare with 4, 3, 9, 7:
        - When j = 1 (l[j]=4), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=3), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=9), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (l[j]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (l[j]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - l[i]=4: compare with 3, 9, 7:
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=3), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=9), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (l[j]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (l[j]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
    - l[i]=3: compare with 9, 7:
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=9), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (l[j]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (l[j]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
    - l[i]=9: compare with 7:
        - When j = 4 (l[j]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (l[j]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - l[i]=7: compare with 7:
        - When j = 5 (l[j]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.
