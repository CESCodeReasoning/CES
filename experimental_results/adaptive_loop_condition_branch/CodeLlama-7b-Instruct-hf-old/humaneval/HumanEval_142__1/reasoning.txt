The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [-16, -9, -2, 36, 36, 26, -20, 25, -40, 20, -4, 12, -26, 35, 37] ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 0 through 15 (since ( len(lst) = 15 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 % 3 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` results in `result = [-16]`, since `lst[0]**2 = 256`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which still satisfies ( 1 % 3 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` updates `result` to [-16, 81], since `lst[1]**2 = 81`.
