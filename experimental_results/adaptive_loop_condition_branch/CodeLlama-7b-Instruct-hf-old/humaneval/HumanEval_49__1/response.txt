def sum_of_integer(N):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1): ## [STATE]i=??[/STATE][STATE]range(1,N+1)=??[/STATE][STATE]N+1=??[/STATE]
        sum += i
    return sum
[/CODE]
[INPUT]
sum_of_integer(5)
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function `sum_of_integer` is called with ( N = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `sum` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( N = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 3 ( 1 + 2 = 3 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 6 ( 3 + 3 = 6 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 10 ( 6 + 4 = 10 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 15 ( 10 + 5 = 1 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `sum`, which is now 15.

[INPUT]

[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function `reverse_string` is called with (input_string = 'hello' ).
Inside the function, a variable `reversed_string` is initialized to ''.
`len(input_string)` = 5 since there are 5 characters in 'hello'.
The loop iterates from 0 to 4 since `range(len(input_string))`= [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

First Iteration(i = 0):
    input_string[i] = 'h'
    reversed_string = 'h' + '' results in reversed_string = 'h'
Second Iteration(i = 1):
    input_string[i] = 'e'
    reversed_string = 'e' + 'h' results in reversed_string = 'eh'
Third Iteration(i = 2):
    i = 2, input_string[i] = 'l'
    reversed_string = 'l' + 'eh' results in reversed_string = 'leh'
Forth Iteration(i = 3): 
    i = 3, input_string[i] = 'l'
    reversed_string = 'l' + 'leh' results in reversed_string = 'lleh'
Fifth Iteration(i = 4): 
    i = 4, input_string[i] = 'o'
    reversed_string = 'o' + 'lleh' results in reversed_string = 'olleh'

[REASONING]
The function `modp` is called with (n = 0, p = 101).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 0 to n-1 since `range(n)` = [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1].

First Iteration(i = 0):
    ret = (2 * ret) % p
    ret = (2 * 1) % 101 = 2
Second Iteration(i = 1):
    ret = (2 * ret) % p
    ret = (2 * 2) % 101 = 4
Third Iteration(i = 2):
    ret = (2 * ret) % p
    ret = (2 * 4) % 101 = 8
Fourth Iteration(i = 3):
    ret = (2 * ret) % p
    ret = (2 * 8) % 101 = 16
Fifth Iteration(i = 4):
    ret = (2 * ret) % p
    ret = (2 * 16) % 101 = 32
...
...
...
Last Iteration(i = n-1):
    ret = (2 * ret) % p
    ret = (2 * (2^n-1)) % 101 = 2^n % 101

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ret`, which is now 2^n % 101.

[REASONING]
The function `is_leap_year` is called with (year = 2000).
Inside the function, a conditional statement is used to check if the year is a leap year.

First, the condition `year % 4 == 0` is evaluated.
If the condition is true, then the code inside the `if` block is executed.

Second, the condition `year % 100 == 0` is evaluated.
If the condition is true, then the code inside the `if` block is executed again.

Third, the condition `year % 400 == 0` is evaluated.
If the condition is true, then the code inside the `if` block is executed again.

If none of the conditions are true, then the code inside the `else` block is executed.

After the conditional statements are evaluated, the function returns the value of `True` if the year is a leap year, otherwise it returns the value of `False`.

[REASONING]
The function `is_prime` is called with (n = 10).
Inside the function, a conditional statement is used to check if the number is prime.

First, the condition `n == 1` is evaluated.
If the condition is true, then the code inside the `if` block is executed.

Second, the condition `range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)` is evaluated.
If the condition is true, then the code inside the `for` loop is executed.

Third, the condition `n % i == 0` is evaluated.
If the condition is true, then the code inside the `if` block is executed again.

If none of the conditions are true, then the code inside the `else` block is executed.

After the conditional statements are evaluated, the function returns the value of `True` if the number is prime, otherwise it returns the value of `False`.
