The function sort_array takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted array.
The function uses the sorted() method to sort the array in ascending order.
The condition for sorting the array is that the first element of the array is added to the last element of the array, and the result is divided by 2.
If the result is 0, then the array is sorted in ascending order.
Otherwise, the array is sorted in descending order.
