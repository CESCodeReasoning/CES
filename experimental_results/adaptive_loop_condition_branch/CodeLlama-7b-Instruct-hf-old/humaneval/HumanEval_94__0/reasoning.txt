The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [127, 97, 8192] ).
Inside the function, a function `isPrime` is defined.
The function `isPrime` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is prime, and `False` otherwise.
The function `isPrime` uses a loop to check if `n` is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `n`.
If `n` is not divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `n`, then `n` must be prime.

The variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through the length of `lst` (since ( i < len(lst) )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - `lst[i]` is 127, which is greater than `maxx` (0).
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is true.
    - Action: `maxx` is updated to 127.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - `lst[i]` is 97, which is greater than `maxx` (127).
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is true.
    - Action: `maxx` is updated to 97.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - `lst[i]` is 8192, which is greater than `maxx` (97).
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is true.
    - Action: `maxx` is updated to 8192.
After the loop completes, the function returns the sum of the digits of `maxx`.
