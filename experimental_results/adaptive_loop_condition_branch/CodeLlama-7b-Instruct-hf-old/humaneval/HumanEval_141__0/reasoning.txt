The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = 'I563_No.exe' ).
The function first splits the file name into a list of strings using the '.' as the separator.
The list is then checked to ensure that it has exactly two elements.
If the list has exactly two elements, the second element is checked to ensure that it is in the list of valid suffixes (txt, exe, dll).
If the second element is not in the list of valid suffixes, the method returns 'No'.
The first element of the list is then checked to ensure that it is not empty and that it starts with a letter.
If the first element does not meet these conditions, the method returns 'No'.
The length of the first element is then checked to ensure that it is less than or equal to 3.
If the length of the first element is greater than 3, the method returns 'No'.
Finally, the method returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `file_name_check('I563_No.exe')` is 'Yes'.
