The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = '[][][[]]' ).
Inside the function, three empty lists are created to store the indices of the opening and closing brackets.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '[' is an opening bracket, so it is added to the list of opening brackets.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '[' is an opening bracket, so it is added to the list of opening brackets.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '[' is an opening bracket, so it is added to the list of opening brackets.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ']' is a closing bracket, so it is added to the list of closing brackets.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ']' is a closing bracket, so it is added to the list of closing brackets.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '[' is an opening bracket, so it is added to the list of opening brackets.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ']' is a closing bracket, so it is added to the list of closing brackets.

The lists of opening and closing brackets are then reversed.

The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0.
The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
The length of the list of closing brackets is stored in the variable `l`.

Iteration 1:
    -The index of the opening bracket at position 0 is compared to the index of the closing bracket at position 0.
    -Since the index of the opening bracket is less than the index of the closing bracket, the condition is true and the counter is incremented.
    -The variable `i` is incremented.
Iteration 2:
    -The index of the opening bracket at position 1 is compared to the index of the closing bracket at position 1.
    -Since the index of the opening bracket is less than the index of the closing bracket, the condition is true and the counter is incremented.
    -The variable `i` is incremented.
Iteration 3:
    -The index of the opening bracket at position 2 is compared to the index of the closing bracket at position 2.
    -Since the index of the opening bracket is less than the index of the closing bracket, the condition is true and the counter is incremented.
    -The variable `i` is incremented.
Iteration 4:
    -The index of the opening bracket at position 3 is compared to the index of the closing bracket at position 3.
    -Since the index of the opening bracket is less than the index of the closing bracket, the condition is true and the counter is incremented.
    -The variable `i` is incremented.
Iteration 5:
    -The index of the opening bracket at position 4 is compared to the index of the closing bracket at position 4.
    -Since the index of the opening bracket is less than the index of the closing bracket, the condition is true and the counter is incremented.
    -The variable `i` is incremented.
Iteration 6:
    -The index of the opening bracket at position 5 is compared to the index of the closing bracket at position 5.
    -Since the index of the opening bracket is less than the index of the closing bracket, the condition is true and the counter is incremented.
    -The variable `i` is incremented.
Iteration 7:
    -The index of the opening bracket at position 6 is compared to the index of the closing bracket at position 6.
    -Since the index of the opening bracket is less than the index of the closing bracket, the condition is true and the counter is incremented.
    -The variable `i` is incremented.

The function returns the value of the counter, which is 3.
