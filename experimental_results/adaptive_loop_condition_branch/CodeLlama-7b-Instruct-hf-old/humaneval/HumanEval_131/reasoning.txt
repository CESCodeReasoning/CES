The function `digits` is called with ( n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1.
A variable `odd_count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the digits of the input number (n = 5).
First Iteration (digit = 5)
   - `digit` is 5, which is an odd number.
   - The condition `int_digit%2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product = product*int_digit` results in `product = 1*5 = 5`.
   - Action: `odd_count = odd_count + 1` updates `odd_count` to 1.
Second Iteration (digit = 5)
   - `digit` is 5, which is still an odd number.
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `product = product*int_digit` updates `product` to 5*5 = 25.
   - Action: `odd_count = odd_count + 1` updates `odd_count` to 2.
Third Iteration (digit = 5)
   - `digit` is 5, which is still an odd number.
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `product = product*int_digit` updates `product` to 25*5 = 125.
   - Action: `odd_count = odd_count + 1` updates `odd_count` to 3.
Fourth Iteration (digit = 5)
   - `digit` is 5, which is still an odd number.
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `product = product*int_digit` updates `product` to 125*5 = 625.
   - Action: `odd_count = odd_count + 1` updates `odd_count` to 4.
Fifth Iteration (digit = 5)
   - `digit` is 5, which is still an odd number.
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `product = product*int_digit` updates `product` to 625*5 = 3125.
   - Action: `odd_count = odd_count + 1` updates `odd_count` to 5.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `product`, which is now 3125.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digits(5)` is 3125.
