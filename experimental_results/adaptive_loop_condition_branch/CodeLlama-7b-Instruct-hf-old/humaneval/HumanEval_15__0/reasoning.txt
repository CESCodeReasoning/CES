The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string that represents the sequence of numbers from 1 to n, separated by a space.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3, we need to generate the sequence of numbers from 1 to 3 and join them with a space.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3 is "1 2 3".
