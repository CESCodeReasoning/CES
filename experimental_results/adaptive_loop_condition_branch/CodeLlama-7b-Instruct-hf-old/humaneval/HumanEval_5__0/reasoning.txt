The function `intersperse` is called with ( numbers = [5, 6, 3, 2], delimeter = 8 ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.
The condition ( not numbers ) is evaluated to False, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The loop iterates from 0 through 3 (since ( len(numbers) = 4 )).
First Iteration (n = 5):
    `result.append(n)` appends 5 to `result`.
    `result.append(delimeter)` appends 8 to `result`.
Second Iteration (n = 6):
    `result.append(n)` appends 6 to `result`.
    `result.append(delimeter)` appends 8 to `result`.
Third Iteration (n = 3):
    `result.append(n)` appends 3 to `result`.
    `result.append(delimeter)` appends 8 to `result`.
Fourth Iteration (n = 2):
    `result.append(n)` appends 2 to `result`.
After the loop completes, the `result` list is returned as the output.
