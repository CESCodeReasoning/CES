[INPUT]
sum_of_integer(5)
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function `sum_of_integer` is called with ( N = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `sum_1` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( N = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which satisfies ( 1 <= i < 3 ).
   - The condition `i >= 1 and i < 3` is true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 1` results in `sum_1 = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which still satisfies ( 1 <=i < 3 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 1` updates `sum_1` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which now satisfies ( 3 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `i < 5` is true (while the first condition `i >= 1 and i < 3` is false).
   - Action: `sum_1 += 2` updates `sum_1` to 4 (`2 + 2 = 4`).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, also satisfying ( 3 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `i < 5` is still true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 2` updates `sum_1` to 6 (`4 + 2 = 6`).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, now outside the previous conditions, falling into the `else` block.
   - The `else` block's action: `sum_1 *= 4` updates `sum_1` to 24 (`6 * 4 = 24`).
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `sum_1`, which is now 24.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_of_integer(5)` is 24.

The function `count_vowels_consonants` is called with ( input_string = "Hello, World!" ).
Inside the function, a variable `vowel_count` and `consonant_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'H' is not in vowels,so consonant_count becomes 1.
