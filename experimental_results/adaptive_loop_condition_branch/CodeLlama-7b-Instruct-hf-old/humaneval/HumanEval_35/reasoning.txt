The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list `l`, which is 1.
The loop iterates over the remaining elements of the list `l`.
First Iteration (e = 2)
   - `e` is 2, which is greater than `m` (1).
   - The condition `e > m` is true.
   - Action: `m` is updated to 2.
Second Iteration (e = 3)
   - `e` is 3, which is greater than `m` (2).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `m` is updated to 3.
Third Iteration (e = 1)
   - `e` is 1, which is less than `m` (3).
   - The condition `e > m` is false.
   - Action: `m` remains 3.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `m`, which is 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `max_element([1, 2, 3])` is 3.
