The function solve takes an integer N as input and returns the binary representation of the sum of the digits of N.
To determine the output of executing the function solve on the input 147, we need to calculate the sum of the digits of 147, which is 1+4+7=12.
Therefore, the binary representation of 12 is 1100, and the output of executing the function solve on the input 147 is "1100".
