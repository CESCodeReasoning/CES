The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, two variables `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is odd and not a palindrome, so `odd_palindrome_count` remains 0.
    -The number 1 is not even and not a palindrome, so `even_palindrome_count` remains 0.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the tuple (even_palindrome_count, odd_palindrome_count), which is (0, 0).

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_palindrome(1)` is (0, 0).
