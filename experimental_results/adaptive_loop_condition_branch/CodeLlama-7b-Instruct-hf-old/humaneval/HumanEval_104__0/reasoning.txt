The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [135, 103, 31] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_digit_elements` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The element 135 is a string, so it is converted to a list of characters.
    -The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is evaluated.
    -The condition is true, so the element is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 103 is a string, so it is converted to a list of characters.
    -The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is evaluated.
    -The condition is false, so the element is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 3:
    -The element 31 is a string, so it is converted to a list of characters.
    -The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is evaluated.
    -The condition is true, so the element is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `unique_digits([135, 103, 31])` is [135, 31].
