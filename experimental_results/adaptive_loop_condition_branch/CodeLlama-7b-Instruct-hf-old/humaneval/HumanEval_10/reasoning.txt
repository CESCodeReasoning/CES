The function `is_palindrome` is called with the argument `string='jerry'`.
Inside the function, a variable `beginning_of_suffix` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates until the condition ( not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) ) is satisfied.
First Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 0):
    - not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) when beginning_of_suffix=0
    - the loop body is executed
Second Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 1):
    - not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) when beginning_of_suffix=1
    - the loop body is executed
Third Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 2):
    - not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) when beginning_of_suffix=2
    - the loop body is executed
Fourth Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 3):
    - not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) when beginning_of_suffix=3
    - the loop body is executed
Fifth Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 4):
    - not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) when beginning_of_suffix=4
    - the loop body is executed
After the loop completes, the condition ( not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `True` as the output.
