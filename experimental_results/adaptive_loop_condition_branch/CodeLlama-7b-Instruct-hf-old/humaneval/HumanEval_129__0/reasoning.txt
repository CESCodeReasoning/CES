The function `minPath` takes a grid and a number of paths as input. It returns a list of the minimum values of the paths.
The function first initializes a variable `val` to a large value, which is the maximum value of the grid plus 1.
The outer loop iterates through each row of the grid.
The inner loop iterates through each column of the grid.
For each cell in the grid, the function checks if the cell is a 1. If it is, the function adds the minimum value of the cells in the same row and column to the `val` variable.
The function then returns the list of `val` values.
