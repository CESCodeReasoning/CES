The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 to (len(arr) // 2) - 1.
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is less than (len(arr) // 2) - 1.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` updates `ans` to 1.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which is less than (len(arr) // 2) - 1.
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` updates `ans` to 2.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which is less than (len(arr) // 2) - 1.
   - The condition is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` updates `ans` to 3.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which is less than (len(arr) // 2) - 1.
   - The condition is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` updates `ans` to 4.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which is less than (len(arr) // 2) - 1.
   - The condition is false.
   - Action: `ans += 1` does not update `ans`.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which is less than (len(arr) // 2) - 1.
   - The condition is false.
   - Action: `ans += 1` does not update `ans`.
Seventh Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is 6, which is less than (len(arr) // 2) - 1.
   - The condition is false.
   - Action: `ans += 1` does not update `ans`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is now 4.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2])` is 4.
