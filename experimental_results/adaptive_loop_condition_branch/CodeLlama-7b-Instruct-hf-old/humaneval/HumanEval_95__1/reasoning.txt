The function `check_dict_case` is called with ( dict = {"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"} ).
Inside the function, a variable `state` is initialized to "start".
The loop iterates over the keys of the dictionary.
First Iteration (key = "Name")
   - `key` is "Name", which is a string.
   - The condition `isinstance(key, str) == False` is false.
   - Action: `state` is set to "start".
Second Iteration (key = "Age")
   - `key` is "Age", which is a string.
   - The condition `isinstance(key, str) == False` is false.
   - Action: `state` is set to "start".
Third Iteration (key = "City")
   - `key` is "City", which is a string.
   - The condition `isinstance(key, str) == False` is false.
   - Action: `state` is set to "start".
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `state`, which is "start".

Therefore, the final output of the function `check_dict_case({"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"})` is False.
