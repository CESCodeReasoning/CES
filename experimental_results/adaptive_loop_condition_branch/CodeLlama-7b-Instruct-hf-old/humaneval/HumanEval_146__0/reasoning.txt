The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the elements of `nums`.
First Iteration (num = 1)
   - `num` is 1, which is greater than 10.
   - The condition `num > 10` is true.
   - The variable `odd_digits` is defined as (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
   - The variable `number_as_string` is assigned the string representation of `num` (i.e., "1").
   - The first digit of `number_as_string` is 1, which is an odd digit.
   - The last digit of `number_as_string` is 1, which is an odd digit.
   - The condition `int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits` is true.
   - Action: `count += 1` updates `count` to 1.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `count`, which is now 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `specialFilter([1])` is 1.
