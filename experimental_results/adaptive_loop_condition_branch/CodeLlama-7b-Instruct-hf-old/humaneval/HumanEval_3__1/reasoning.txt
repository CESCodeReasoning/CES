The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, -1, 2, -2, 5, -5, 4, -4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `op` is 1, so `balance` becomes 1.
    - The condition `balance < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
Iteration 2:
    - `op` is -1, so `balance` becomes -1.
    - The condition `balance < 0` is true, so the branch is taken.
    - The function returns `True`.
Iteration 3:
    - `op` is 2, so `balance` becomes 1.
    - The condition `balance < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
Iteration 4:
    - `op` is -2, so `balance` becomes -2.
    - The condition `balance < 0` is true, so the branch is taken.
    - The function returns `True`.
Iteration 5:
    - `op` is 5, so `balance` becomes 5.
    - The condition `balance < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
Iteration 6:
    - `op` is -5, so `balance` becomes -5.
    - The condition `balance < 0` is true, so the branch is taken.
    - The function returns `True`.
Iteration 7:
    - `op` is 4, so `balance` becomes 1.
    - The condition `balance < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
Iteration 8:
    - `op` is -4, so `balance` becomes -4.
    - The condition `balance < 0` is true, so the branch is taken.
    - The function returns `True`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `below_zero([1, -1, 2, -2, 5, -5, 4, -4])` is `True`.
