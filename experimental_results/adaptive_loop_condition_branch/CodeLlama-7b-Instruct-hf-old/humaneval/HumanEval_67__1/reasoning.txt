The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "5 apples and 6 oranges", n = 21 ).
Inside the function, a variable `lis` is initialized to an empty list.
The string `s` is split into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter.
The list of words is then iterated over.
First Iteration:
   - `i` is "5".
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is true, so the `if` block is executed.
   - The `if` block appends the integer value of `i` (5) to the list `lis`.
Second Iteration:
   - `i` is "apples".
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false, so the `else` block is executed.
   - The `else` block does not modify the list `lis`.
Third Iteration:
   - `i` is "and".
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false, so the `else` block is executed.
   - The `else` block does not modify the list `lis`.
Fourth Iteration:
   - `i` is "6".
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is true, so the `if` block is executed.
   - The `if` block appends the integer value of `i` (6) to the list `lis`.
Fifth Iteration:
   - `i` is "oranges".
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false, so the `else` block is executed.
   - The `else` block does not modify the list `lis`.
The `for` loop completes, and the function returns the value of `n` minus the sum of the elements in the list `lis`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges",21)` is 16.
