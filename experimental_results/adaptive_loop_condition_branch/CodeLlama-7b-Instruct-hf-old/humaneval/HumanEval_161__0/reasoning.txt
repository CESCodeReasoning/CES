The function `solve` is called with ( s = "#a@C" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` is initialized to 0.
A variable `idx` is initialized to 0.
A variable `new_str` is initialized to a list of the characters in `s`.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '#' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 0.
    -The character 'a' is a letter, so `flg` becomes 1.
    -The character '@' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
    -The character 'C' is a letter, so `flg` becomes 1.
    -The character 'C' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '#' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
    -The character 'a' is a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
    -The character '@' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
    -The character 'C' is a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
    -The character 'C' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '#' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
    -The character 'a' is a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
    -The character '@' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
    -The character 'C' is a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
    -The character 'C' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '#' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
    -The character 'a' is a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
    -The character '@' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
    -The character 'C' is a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
    -The character 'C' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 1.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `s` in reverse order.
