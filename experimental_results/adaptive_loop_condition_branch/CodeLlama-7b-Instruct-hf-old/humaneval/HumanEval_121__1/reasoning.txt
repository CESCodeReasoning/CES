The function solution takes a list of integers lst as input and returns the sum of all the even indices that contain odd numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32], we need to follow the steps below:

1. The list [30, 13, 23, 32] has four elements.
2. The first element is 30, which is even.
3. The second element is 13, which is odd.
4. The third element is 23, which is odd.
5. The fourth element is 32, which is even.
6. The sum of all the even indices that contain odd numbers is 13 + 23 = 36.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32] is 36.
