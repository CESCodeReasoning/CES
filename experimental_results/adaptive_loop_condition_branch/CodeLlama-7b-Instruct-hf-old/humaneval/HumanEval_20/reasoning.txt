The function find_closest_elements(numbers) takes a list of floats as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by idx in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (idx=0):
    - `idx` is 0, `elem` in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    - `elem` is 1.0, compare with 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2:
        - When `idx2` is 1 (elem2=2.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` is 2 (elem2=3.9), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` is 3 (elem2=4.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` is 4 (elem2=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` is 5 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (idx=1):
    - `idx` is 1, `elem` in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
    - `elem` is 2.0, compare with 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2:
        - When `idx2` is 2 (elem2=3.9), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` is 3 (elem2=4.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` is 4 (elem2=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` is 5 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (idx=2):
    - `idx` is 2, `elem` in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5, 6.
    - `elem` is 3.9, compare with 4.0, 5.0, 2.2:
        - When `idx2` is 3 (elem2=4.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` is 4 (elem2=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` is 5 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (idx=3):
    - `idx` is 3, `elem` in the inner loop is 4, 5, 6.
    - `elem` is 4.0, compare with 5.0, 2.2:
        - When `idx2` is 4 (elem2=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` is 5 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (idx=4):
    - `idx` is 4, `elem` in the inner loop is 5, 6.
    - `elem` is 5.0, compare with 2.2:
        - When `idx2` is 5 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth Iteration (idx=5):
    - `idx` is 5, `elem` in the inner loop is 6.
    - `elem` is 2.2, compare with nothing:
        - When `idx2` is 6 (elem2=6), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Seventh Iteration (idx=6):
    - `idx` is 6, `elem` in the inner loop is 6.
    - `elem` is 6.0, compare with nothing:
        - When `idx2` is 6 (elem2=6), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
No more elements to compare.
