The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input and returns a string that is the result of shuffling the letters in each word in s, but not the spaces between the words.
To determine the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input "Hello World!!!", we need to shuffle the letters in each word in "Hello World!!!".
Therefore, the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input "Hello World!!! is "Hello World!!!".
