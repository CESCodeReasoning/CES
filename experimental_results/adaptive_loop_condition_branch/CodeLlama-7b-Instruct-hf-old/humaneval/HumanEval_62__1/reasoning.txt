The function derivative takes a list of numbers xs as input and returns a list of the derivatives of the function f(x) = x^i, where i is the index of the element in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function derivative on the input [3, 2, 1], we need to compute the derivatives of the function f(x) = x^i for each i in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function derivative on the input [3, 2, 1] is [3, 2, 1], since the derivative of f(x) = x^i is simply ix for each i in the list.
