The function `special_factorial` is called with (n = 4).
Inside the function, two variables `fact_i` and `special_fact` are initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 1 to 4 since `range(1, (n + 1))` = [1, 2, 3, 4].

First Iteration(i = 1):
    fact_i = 1
    special_fact = 1
Second Iteration(i = 2):
    fact_i = 2
    special_fact = 2
Third Iteration(i = 3):
    fact_i = 6
    special_fact = 6
Fourth Iteration(i = 4):
    fact_i = 24
    special_fact = 24
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `special_fact`, which is now 24.
