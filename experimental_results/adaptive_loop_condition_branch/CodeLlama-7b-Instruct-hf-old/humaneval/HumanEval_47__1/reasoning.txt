The function `median` is called with a list of integers.
The list is sorted using the `sorted` method.
The length of the list is checked to determine if it is odd or even.
If the length is odd, the median is the middle element of the list.
If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
The method returns the median.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])` is 10.
