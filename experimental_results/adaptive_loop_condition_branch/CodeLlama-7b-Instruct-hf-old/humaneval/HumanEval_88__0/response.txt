You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def sort_array(array):
    return [] if len(array) == 0 else sorted(
        array, reverse=(array[0] + array[-1]) % 2 == 0)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6])
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [ANSWER]
The function sort_array takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted array.
The function uses the sorted() method to sort the array in ascending order.
The condition for sorting the array is that the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even.
If the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, then the array is sorted in ascending order.
Otherwise, the array is not sorted.
