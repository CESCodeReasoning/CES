You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def get_row(lst, x):
    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst))
              for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
    return sorted(
        sorted(
            coords,
            key=lambda x: x[1],
            reverse=True),
        key=lambda x: x[0])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
get_row([[1]], 2)
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [ANSWER]
The function get_row takes a list of lists lst and an integer x as input. It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row and column indices of the element in lst that is equal to x.

To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1], 2], we need to find the row and column indices of the element in lst that is equal to x. Since the only element in lst is 1, the only tuple in the output list will be (0, 0).

Therefore, the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1], 2] is [(0, 0)].
