The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'a b c d g' ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `dict1` is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The input string is split into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter.
The list of words is stored in `list1`.

Iteration 1:
    -The first word in `list1` is 'a'.
    -The count of 'a' in `list1` is 1.
    -The variable `t` is set to 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second word in `list1` is 'b'.
    -The count of 'b' in `list1` is 1.
    -The variable `t` is still 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The third word in `list1` is 'c'.
    -The count of 'c' in `list1` is 1.
    -The variable `t` is still 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth word in `list1` is 'd'.
    -The count of 'd' in `list1` is 1.
    -The variable `t` is still 1.
Iteration 5:
    -The fifth word in `list1` is 'g'.
    -The count of 'g' in `list1` is 1.
    -The variable `t` is still 1.

After the loop, the variable `t` is still 1, indicating that the maximum count of any word in `list1` is 1.
The loop is then executed again, but this time the condition `list1.count(i) == t` is never met, since the maximum count of any word in `list1` is 1.
Therefore, the dictionary `dict1` is not updated.

Finally, the function returns the dictionary `dict1`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `histogram('a b c d g')` is an empty dictionary.
