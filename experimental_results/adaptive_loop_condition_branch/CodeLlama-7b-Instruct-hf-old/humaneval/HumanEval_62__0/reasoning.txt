The function derivative takes a list of numbers xs as input and returns a list of the derivatives of the function f(x) = x at the points in xs.
To determine the output of executing the function derivative on the input [1], we need to compute the derivative of the function f(x) = x at the point x = 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function derivative on the input [1] is [1].
