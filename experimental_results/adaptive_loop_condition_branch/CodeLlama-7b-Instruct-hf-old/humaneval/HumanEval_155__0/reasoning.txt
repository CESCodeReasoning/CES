The function `even_odd_count` is called with ( num = -345821 ).
Inside the function, two variables `even_count` and `odd_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '3' is not even, so odd_count becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '4' is not even, so odd_count becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '5' is not even, so odd_count becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '8' is not even, so odd_count becomes 4.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '2' is even, so even_count becomes 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '1' is not even, so odd_count becomes 5.
Iteration 7:
    -The character 'N' is not even, so odd_count becomes 6.
Iteration 8:
    -The character 'O' is not even, so odd_count becomes 7.
Iteration 9:
    -The character 'D' is not even, so odd_count becomes 8.
Iteration 10:
    -The character '!' is not even, so odd_count becomes 9.

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_count(-345821)` is (1, 9).
