The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers where each number has been rescaled to have a range of 0 to 1.
To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9], we need to perform the following steps:

1. Find the minimum and maximum values in the input list.
[CONDITION] min_number = 2.0 [/CONDITION]
[CONDITION] max_number = 49.9 [/CONDITION]
2. Subtract the minimum value from each number in the input list to get a list of numbers with the same range as the input list.
[BRANCH] Y [/BRANCH]
[STATE] numbers = [2.0 - 2.0, 49.9 - 2.0] = [0.0, 47.9] [/STATE]
3. Divide each number in the list by the range of the input list to get a list of numbers with a range of 0 to 1.
[BRANCH] Y [/BRANCH]
[STATE] rescaled_numbers = [0.0 / (49.9 - 2.0), 47.9 / (49.9 - 2.0)] = [0.0, 0.94] [/STATE]
4. Return the rescaled list of numbers.
[BRANCH] N [/BRANCH]
[OUTPUT] [0.0, 0.94] [/OUTPUT]
