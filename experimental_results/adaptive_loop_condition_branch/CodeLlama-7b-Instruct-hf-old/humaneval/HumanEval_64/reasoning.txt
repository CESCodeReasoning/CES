The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "abcde" ).
The variable `vowels` is initialized to "aeiouAEIOU".
The loop iterates over the characters in `s`.
First Iteration (c = 'a')
   - `c` is 'a', which is a vowel.
   - The condition `c in vowels` is true.
   - Action: `n_vowels += 1` updates `n_vowels` to 1.
Second Iteration (c = 'b')
   - `c` is 'b', which is not a vowel.
   - The condition `c in vowels` is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels` remains 1.
Third Iteration (c = 'c')
   - `c` is 'c', which is a vowel.
   - The condition `c in vowels` is true.
   - Action: `n_vowels += 1` updates `n_vowels` to 2.
Fourth Iteration (c = 'd')
   - `c` is 'd', which is not a vowel.
   - The condition `c in vowels` is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels` remains 2.
Fifth Iteration (c = 'e')
   - `c` is 'e', which is a vowel.
   - The condition `c in vowels` is true.
   - Action: `n_vowels += 1` updates `n_vowels` to 3.
The loop completes, and the method returns the value of `n_vowels`, which is 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("abcde")` is 3.
