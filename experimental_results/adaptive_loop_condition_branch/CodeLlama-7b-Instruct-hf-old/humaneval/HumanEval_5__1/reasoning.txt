The function `intersperse` is called with ( numbers = [2, 2, 2], delimeter = 2 ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.
The condition ( not numbers ) is evaluated to False, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The loop iterates from 0 through 2 (since ( len(numbers) = 3 )).
First Iteration (n = 2):
    `result.append(n)` appends 2 to `result`, making `result` equal to [2].
    `result.append(delimeter)` appends 2 to `result`, making `result` equal to [2, 2].
Second Iteration (n = 2):
    `result.append(n)` appends 2 to `result`, making `result` equal to [2, 2, 2].
    `result.append(delimeter)` appends 2 to `result`, making `result` equal to [2, 2, 2, 2].
Third Iteration (n = 2):
    `result.append(n)` appends 2 to `result`, making `result` equal to [2, 2, 2, 2, 2].
After the loop completes, the function returns `result` as the output.
