The function `pluck` is called with ( arr = [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2] ).
The first condition `len(arr) == 0` is false, therefore the first branch is not taken.
The second condition `evens == []` is false, therefore the second branch is not taken.
The function returns the list `[min(evens), arr.index(min(evens))]` which is `[2, 4]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])` is [2, 4].
