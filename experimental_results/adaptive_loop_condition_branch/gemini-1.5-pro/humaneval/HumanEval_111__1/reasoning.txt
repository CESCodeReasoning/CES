The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'b b b b a' ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `dict1` is initialized to an empty dictionary, and a list `list1` is created by splitting the input string `test` by spaces.
The variable `t` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The first element of `list1` is 'b'.
    - `list1.count('b')` returns 4, which is greater than `t` (0).
    - `i` is not an empty string.
    - The condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i != ''` is true.
    - `t` is updated to 4.

Iteration 2:
    - The second element of `list1` is 'b'.
    - `list1.count('b')` returns 4, which is equal to `t` (4).
    - `i` is not an empty string.
    - The condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i != ''` is false.

Iteration 3:
    - The third element of `list1` is 'b'.
    - `list1.count('b')` returns 4, which is equal to `t` (4).
    - `i` is not an empty string.
    - The condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i != ''` is false.

Iteration 4:
    - The fourth element of `list1` is 'b'.
    - `list1.count('b')` returns 4, which is equal to `t` (4).
    - `i` is not an empty string.
    - The condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i != ''` is false.

Iteration 5:
    - The fifth element of `list1` is 'a'.
    - `list1.count('a')` returns 1, which is less than `t` (4).
    - `i` is not an empty string.
    - The condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i != ''` is false.

Since `t` is greater than 0, the second loop is executed.

Iteration 1:
    - The first element of `list1` is 'b'.
    - `list1.count('b')` returns 4, which is equal to `t` (4).
    - The condition `(list1.count(i) == t)` is true.
    - `dict1['b']` is set to 4.

Iteration 2:
    - The second element of `list1` is 'b'.
    - `list1.count('b')` returns 4, which is equal to `t` (4).
    - The condition `(list1.count(i) == t)` is true.
    - `dict1['b']` is already set to 4, so it is not updated.

Iteration 3:
    - The third element of `list1` is 'b'.
    - `list1.count('b')` returns 4, which is equal to `t` (4).
    - The condition `(list1.count(i) == t)` is true.
    - `dict1['b']` is already set to 4, so it is not updated.

Iteration 4:
    - The fourth element of `list1` is 'b'.
    - `list1.count('b')` returns 4, which is equal to `t` (4).
    - The condition `(list1.count(i) == t)` is true.
    - `dict1['b']` is already set to 4, so it is not updated.

Iteration 5:
    - The fifth element of `list1` is 'a'.
    - `list1.count('a')` returns 1, which is not equal to `t` (4).
    - The condition `(list1.count(i) == t)` is false.

The function returns the dictionary `dict1`, which contains the key 'b' with the value 4.
