The function `words_string` is called with ( s = "Hi, my name is John" ).
The function first checks if the input string `s` is empty. Since `s` is not empty, the function proceeds to process the string.
The function iterates through each character in the string `s`.
For each character, the function checks if the character is a comma (,). If the character is a comma, the function appends a space character to the list `s_list`. Otherwise, the function appends the character to the list `s_list`.
After iterating through all the characters in the string, the function joins the list `s_list` into a single string and splits the string into a list of words.
The function returns the list of words.
