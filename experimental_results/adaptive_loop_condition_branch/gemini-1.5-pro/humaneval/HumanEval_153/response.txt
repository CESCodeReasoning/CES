[REASONING]
The function `Strongest_Extension` is called with ( class_name = 'Watashi', extensions = ['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `strong` is initialized to the first element of `extensions`, which is 'tEN'.
The variable `my_val` is initialized to the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in 'tEN'. In this case, there are 2 uppercase letters and 1 lowercase letter, so `my_val` is 1.
The loop iterates over the remaining elements of `extensions`.
For each element `s` in `extensions`, the variable `val` is initialized to the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in `s`.
If `val` is greater than `my_val`, then the variable `strong` is updated to `s` and `my_val` is updated to `val`.
After the loop has finished, the variable `ans` is constructed by concatenating the `class_name` with a period and the `strong` extension. In this case, `ans` is 'Watashi.niNE'.
The function returns the value of `ans`.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strong = extensions[0]
    my_val = len([x for x in extensions[0] if x.isalpha() and x.isupper()]) - len([x for x in extensions[0] if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])
    for s in extensions: ## [STATE]extensions=['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe'][/STATE]
        val = len([x for x in s if x.isalpha() and x.isupper()]) - len([x for x in s if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])
        if val > my_val: ## [CONDITION](val > my_val)=[False, True, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, Y, N][/BRANCH]
            strong = s
            my_val = val

    ans = class_name + "." + strong
    return ans
