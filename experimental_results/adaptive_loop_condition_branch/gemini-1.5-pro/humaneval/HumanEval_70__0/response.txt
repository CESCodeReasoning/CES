[REASONING]
The function `strange_sort_list` is called with ( lst = [] ).
Inside the function, two variables `res` and `switch` are initialized to [] and True, respectively.
The while loop iterates until `lst` is empty.
Since `lst` is empty, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `res`, which is now [].

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def strange_sort_list(lst):
    res, switch = [], True
    while lst: ## [STATE]lst=[][/STATE]
        res.append(min(lst) if switch else max(lst))
        lst.remove(res[-1])
        switch = not switch
    return res
