The function `can_arrange` is called with ( arr = [1,2,4,5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The loop iterates from 1 through 3 (since ( len(arr) = 4 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    - i < len(arr) when i=1
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - i < len(arr) when i=2
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - i < len(arr) when i=3
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true. The branch is taken.
    - `ind` is updated to 3.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is now 3.
