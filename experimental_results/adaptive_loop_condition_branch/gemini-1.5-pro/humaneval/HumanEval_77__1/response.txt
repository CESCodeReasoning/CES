[REASONING]
The function iscube takes an integer a as input and returns True if a is a perfect cube, and False otherwise.
To determine if a is a perfect cube, the function first takes the absolute value of a and stores it in a.
Then, the function rounds a to the nearest integer and raises it to the power of 1/3.
The result is then rounded to the nearest integer and cubed.
If the result is equal to a, then a is a perfect cube and the function returns True.
Otherwise, the function returns False.
In this case, a is 0, so the function will return True.

[ANSWER]
def iscube(a):
    a = abs(a)  # [STATE] a = 0 [/STATE]
    return int(round(a ** (1. / 3))) ** 3 == a  # [CONDITION] int(round(0 ** (1. / 3))) ** 3 == 0 [/CONDITION] [BRANCH] Y [/BRANCH]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
True
