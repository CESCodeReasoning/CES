[REASONING]
The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the odd numbers in the list that are not floats.
To determine the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [0.2, 3, 5], we need to first filter out the numbers that are not odd or are floats.
The numbers that are not odd or are floats are 0.2 and 5.
The remaining numbers are 3.
We then square each of the remaining numbers and sum them up.
Therefore, the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [0.2, 3, 5] is 9.
