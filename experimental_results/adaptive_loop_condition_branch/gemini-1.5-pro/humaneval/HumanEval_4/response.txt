[REASONING]
The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of floats as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list.
The mean absolute deviation is calculated by first calculating the mean of the numbers in the list.
Then, for each number in the list, the absolute difference between the number and the mean is calculated.
Finally, the mean of the absolute differences is calculated and returned.
To determine the output of executing the function mean_absolute_deviation on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], we need to first calculate the mean of the numbers in the list.
The mean is (1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0) / 3 = 2.0.
Next, for each number in the list, we need to calculate the absolute difference between the number and the mean.
The absolute differences are |1.0 - 2.0| = 1.0, |2.0 - 2.0| = 0.0, and |3.0 - 2.0| = 1.0.
Finally, we need to calculate the mean of the absolute differences.
The mean of the absolute differences is (1.0 + 0.0 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.6666666666666666.
Therefore, the output of executing the function mean_absolute_deviation on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] is 0.6666666666666666.

[ANSWER]
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    return sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
0.6666666666666666
