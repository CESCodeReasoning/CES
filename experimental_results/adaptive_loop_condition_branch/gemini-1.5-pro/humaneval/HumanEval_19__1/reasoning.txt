The function sort_numbers takes a string numbers as input and returns a string with the numbers in the input string sorted in ascending order.
The function first creates a dictionary value_map that maps the string representation of a number to its integer value.
Then, the function splits the input string into a list of strings, removes any empty strings from the list, and sorts the list of strings using the key function lambda x: value_map[x], which returns the integer value of the string x.
Finally, the function joins the sorted list of strings into a single string and returns the result.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_numbers on the input 'three five nine', we need to first split the input string into a list of strings, which is ['three', 'five', 'nine'].
Then, we need to remove any empty strings from the list, which results in the list ['three', 'five', 'nine'].
Next, we need to sort the list of strings using the key function lambda x: value_map[x], which returns the integer value of the string x.
This results in the sorted list ['five', 'nine', 'three'].
Finally, we need to join the sorted list of strings into a single string, which results in the output 'five nine three'.
