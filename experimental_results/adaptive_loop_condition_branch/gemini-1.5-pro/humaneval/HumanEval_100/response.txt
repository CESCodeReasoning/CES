[REASONING]
The function make_a_pile takes an integer n as input and returns a list of n integers, where the i-th integer in the list is n + 2*i.
To determine the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 3, we need to evaluate the list comprehension [n + 2*i for i in range(n)].
The range(n) generates a list of integers from 0 to n-1, which is [0, 1, 2] in this case.
For each integer i in the list, we evaluate the expression n + 2*i.
For i = 0, we get n + 2*0 = n + 0 = n.
For i = 1, we get n + 2*1 = n + 2.
For i = 2, we get n + 2*2 = n + 4.
Therefore, the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 3 is the list [n, n + 2, n + 4], which is [3, 5, 7].
