The function `largest_prime_factor` is called with ( n = 15 ).
Inside the function, a variable `largest` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 2 through 15 (since ( n = 15 )).
First Iteration (j = 2)
   - `n % j == 0` is true (since 15 is divisible by 2).
   - `is_prime(j)` is true (since 2 is prime).
   - Action: `largest` is updated to 2 (since 2 is the largest prime factor found so far).
Second Iteration (j = 3)
   - `n % j == 0` is true (since 15 is divisible by 3).
   - `is_prime(j)` is true (since 3 is prime).
   - Action: `largest` is updated to 3 (since 3 is the largest prime factor found so far).
Third Iteration (j = 4)
   - `n % j == 0` is false (since 15 is not divisible by 4).
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
   - Action: `largest` is not updated.
Fourth Iteration (j = 5)
   - `n % j == 0` is true (since 15 is divisible by 5).
   - `is_prime(j)` is true (since 5 is prime).
   - Action: `largest` is updated to 5 (since 5 is the largest prime factor found so far).
Fifth Iteration (j = 6)
   - `n % j == 0` is false (since 15 is not divisible by 6).
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
   - Action: `largest` is not updated.
Sixth Iteration (j = 7)
   - `n % j == 0` is false (since 15 is not divisible by 7).
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
   - Action: `largest` is not updated.
Seventh Iteration (j = 8)
   - `n % j == 0` is false (since 15 is not divisible by 8).
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
   - Action: `largest` is not updated.
Eighth Iteration (j = 9)
   - `n % j == 0` is false (since 15 is not divisible by 9).
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
   - Action: `largest` is not updated.
Ninth Iteration (j = 10)
   - `n % j == 0` is false (since 15 is not divisible by 10).
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
   - Action: `largest` is not updated.
Tenth Iteration (j = 11)
   - `n % j == 0` is false (since 15 is not divisible by 11).
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
   - Action: `largest` is not updated.
Eleventh Iteration (j = 12)
   - `n % j == 0` is false (since 15 is not divisible by 12).
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
   - Action: `largest` is not updated.
Twelfth Iteration (j = 13)
   - `n % j == 0` is false (since 15 is not divisible by 13).
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
   - Action: `largest` is not updated.
Thirteenth Iteration (j = 14)
   - `n % j == 0` is false (since 15 is not divisible by 14).
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
   - Action: `largest` is not updated.
Fourteenth Iteration (j = 15)
   - `n % j == 0` is true (since 15 is divisible by 15).
   - `is_prime(j)` is false (since 15 is not prime).
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false.
   - Action: `largest` is not updated.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `largest`, which is 5.
