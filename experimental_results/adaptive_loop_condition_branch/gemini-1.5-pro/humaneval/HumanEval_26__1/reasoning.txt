The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers numbers as input and returns a new list with all duplicate elements removed.
To determine the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [], we need to first create a Counter object c from the input list.
The Counter object c will contain the count of each element in the input list.
Then, we need to iterate over the input list and check if the count of the current element in the Counter object c is less than or equal to 1.
If the count is less than or equal to 1, then the current element is not a duplicate and we add it to the output list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [] is [].
