[REASONING]
The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 97, shift = 8 ).
The value of `x` is converted to a string `s` which is '97'.
The condition `shift > len(s)` is checked, where `len(s)` is 2 and `shift` is 8.
Since `shift` is greater than the length of the string, the if branch is taken.
The if branch returns the reverse of the string, which is '79'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(97, 8)` is '79'.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s): ## [CONDITION](shift > len(s))=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return s[::-1]
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return s[len(s) - shift:] + s[:len(s) - shift]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
79
