[REASONING]
The function remove_vowels takes a string text as input and returns a new string with all the vowels removed.
To determine the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input '', we need to iterate over each character in the string and check if it is a vowel.
If the character is a vowel, we skip it.
Otherwise, we add it to the new string.
Since there are no vowels in the input string, the output string will be empty.
Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input '' is ''.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def remove_vowels(text):
    return "".join([s for s in text if s.lower()
                   not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]])
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
