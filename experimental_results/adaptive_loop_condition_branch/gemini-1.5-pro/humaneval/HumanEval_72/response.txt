[REASONING]
The function `will_it_fly` is called with ( q = [3, 2, 3], w = 9 ).
First, the function checks if the sum of the elements in `q` is greater than `w`. In this case, the sum of the elements in `q` is 8, which is not greater than 9, so the first branch is not taken.
Next, the function initializes two variables, `i` and `j`, to 0 and the length of `q` minus 1, respectively.
The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than `j`.
Inside the loop, the function checks if the elements at indices `i` and `j` in `q` are not equal. In this case, the elements at indices 0 and 2 in `q` are not equal, so the second branch is taken.
The function then returns False, indicating that the list will not fly.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def will_it_fly(q,w):
    if sum(q) > w: ## [CONDITION](sum(q) > w)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return False

    i, j = 0, len(q)-1
    while i<j: ## [STATE]i=[0][/STATE][STATE]j=[2][/STATE]
        if q[i] != q[j]: ## [CONDITION](q[i] != q[j])=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
            return False
        i+=1
        j-=1
    return True
