[REASONING]
The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -3, 1, 2, -3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The first operation is 1, so `balance` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The second operation is 2, so `balance` becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    - The third operation is -3, so `balance` becomes 0.
Iteration 4:
    - The fourth operation is 1, so `balance` becomes 1.
Iteration 5:
    - The fifth operation is 2, so `balance` becomes 3.
Iteration 6:
    - The sixth operation is -3, so `balance` becomes 0.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
 ## [STATE]op=[1, 2, -3, 1, 2, -3][/STATE]
    for op in operations: ## [STATE]operations=[1, 2, -3, 1, 2, -3][/STATE]
        balance += op
        if balance < 0: ## [CONDITION](balance < 0)=[False, False, True, False, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, Y, N, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            return True

    return False
