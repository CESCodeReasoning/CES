[REASONING]
The function right_angle_triangle takes three integers a, b, and c as input and returns True if the three integers satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angle triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
To determine the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input 1, 1, and 1, we need to check if the three integers satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.
We can do this by checking if a * a == b * b + c * c, or if b * b == a * a + c * c, or if c * c == a * a + b * b.
Since 1 * 1 == 1 * 1 + 1 * 1, the three integers satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.
Therefore, the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input 1, 1, and 1 is True.

[ANSWER]
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # [STATE]a * a == b * b + c * c or b * b == a * a + c * c or c * c == a * a + b * b[/STATE]
    return a * a == b * b + c * c or b * b == a * a + c * c or c * c == a * a + b * b
