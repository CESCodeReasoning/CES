[REASONING]
The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [5, -2, 1, -5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the elements of `nums`.
First Iteration ( num = 5 )
   - `num` is 5, which is not greater than 10.
   - The condition `num > 10` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration without incrementing `count`.
Second Iteration ( num = -2 )
   - `num` is -2, which is not greater than 10.
   - The condition `num > 10` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration without incrementing `count`.
Third Iteration ( num = 1 )
   - `num` is 1, which is not greater than 10.
   - The condition `num > 10` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration without incrementing `count`.
Fourth Iteration ( num = -5 )
   - `num` is -5, which is not greater than 10.
   - The condition `num > 10` is false.
   - Action: The loop terminates without incrementing `count`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `count`, which is 0.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def specialFilter(nums):
    
    count = 0 ## [STATE]num=[5, -2, 1, -5][/STATE]
    for num in nums: ## [STATE]nums=[5, -2, 1, -5][/STATE]
        if num > 10: ## [CONDITION](num > 10)=[False, False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
            number_as_string = str(num)
            if int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits:
                count += 1
        
    return count
