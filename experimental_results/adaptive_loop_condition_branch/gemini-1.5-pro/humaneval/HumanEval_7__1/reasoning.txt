The function filter_by_substring takes a list of strings and a substring as input, and returns a list of strings that contain the substring.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'aaaxxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xx', we need to check if each string in the input list contains the substring 'xx'.
The first string 'xxx' contains the substring 'xx', so it is included in the output list.
The second string 'asd' does not contain the substring 'xx', so it is not included in the output list.
The third string 'aaaxxy' contains the substring 'xx', so it is included in the output list.
The fourth string 'john doe' does not contain the substring 'xx', so it is not included in the output list.
The fifth string 'xxxAAA' contains the substring 'xx', so it is included in the output list.
The sixth string 'xxx' contains the substring 'xx', so it is included in the output list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'aaaxxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xx' is ['xxx', 'aaaxxy', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'].
