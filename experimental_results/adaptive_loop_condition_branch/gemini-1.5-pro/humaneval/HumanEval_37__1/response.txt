[REASONING]
The function `sort_even` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3] ).
First, the list is split into two lists: `evens` contains the even-indexed elements ( [2] ) and `odds` contains the odd-indexed elements ( [1, 3] ).
Then, the `evens` list is sorted in ascending order.
Next, an empty list `ans` is created.
The `zip` function is used to iterate over the `evens` and `odds` lists simultaneously.
For each pair of elements (e, o), the element `e` is appended to the `ans` list, followed by the element `o`.
After the loop completes, the `ans` list contains the sorted even elements followed by the unsorted odd elements ( [2, 1, 3] ).
Since the length of the `evens` list ( 1 ) is greater than the length of the `odds` list ( 2 ), the last element of the `evens` list ( 2 ) is appended to the `ans` list.
Finally, the `ans` list is returned as the output.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def sort_even(l: list):
    evens = l[::2]
    odds = l[1::2]
    evens.sort()
    ans = []
    for e, o in zip(evens, odds): ## [STATE]e=[2][/STATE][STATE]o=[1][/STATE][STATE]zip(evens, odds)=[(2, 1), (3, None)]][/STATE][STATE]evens=[2][/STATE][STATE]odds=[1, 3][/STATE]
        ans.extend([e, o])
    if len(evens) > len(odds): ## [CONDITION](len(evens) > len(odds))=True[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        ans.append(evens[-1])
    return ans
