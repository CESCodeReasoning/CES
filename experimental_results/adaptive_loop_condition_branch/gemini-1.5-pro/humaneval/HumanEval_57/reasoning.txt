The function `monotonic` is called with the list `[1, 2, 4, 10]`.
The condition `l == sorted(l)` checks if the list is sorted in ascending order.
The condition `l == sorted(l, reverse=True)` checks if the list is sorted in descending order.
Since `[1, 2, 4, 10]` is sorted in ascending order, the first condition is true and the function returns True.
