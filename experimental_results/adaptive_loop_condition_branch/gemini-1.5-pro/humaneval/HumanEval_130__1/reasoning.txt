The function `tri` is called with ( n = 8 ).
The function first checks if ( n == 0 ), which is not the case here, so it proceeds to the next part.
It initializes a list `my_tri` with the first two elements [1, 3].
The loop iterates from 2 to 8 (since ( n = 8 )).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is even ( 2 % 2 == 0 ), so the condition is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` appends 2 to `my_tri`, resulting in `[1, 3, 2]`.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is odd ( 3 % 2 != 0 ), so the condition is false.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` appends 9 to `my_tri`, resulting in `[1, 3, 2, 9]`.
Third Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is even ( 4 % 2 == 0 ), so the condition is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` appends 3 to `my_tri`, resulting in `[1, 3, 2, 9, 3]`.
Fourth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is odd ( 5 % 2 != 0 ), so the condition is false.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` appends 18 to `my_tri`, resulting in `[1, 3, 2, 9, 3, 18]`.
Fifth Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is even ( 6 % 2 == 0 ), so the condition is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` appends 4 to `my_tri`, resulting in `[1, 3, 2, 9, 3, 18, 4]`.
Sixth Iteration (i = 7)
   - `i` is odd ( 7 % 2 != 0 ), so the condition is false.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` appends 30 to `my_tri`, resulting in `[1, 3, 2, 9, 3, 18, 4, 30]`.
Seventh Iteration (i = 8)
   - `i` is even ( 8 % 2 == 0 ), so the condition is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` appends 5 to `my_tri`, resulting in `[1, 3, 2, 9, 3, 18, 4, 30, 5]`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `my_tri`, which is `[1, 3, 2, 9, 3, 18, 4, 30, 5]`.
