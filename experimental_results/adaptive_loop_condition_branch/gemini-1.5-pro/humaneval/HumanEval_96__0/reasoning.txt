The function count_up_to(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
It initializes an empty list called primes to store the prime numbers found.
The outer loop iterates through all the numbers from 2 to n-1.
For each number i in the outer loop, the inner loop iterates through all the numbers from 2 to i-1 to check if i is divisible by any of them.
If i is divisible by any number in the inner loop, then it is not a prime number and the is_prime flag is set to False.
If i is not divisible by any number in the inner loop, then it is a prime number and is added to the primes list.
The function returns the primes list.
First Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 2.
    - 2 is not divisible by 2, so is_prime is True.
    - Append 2 to primes.
Second Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 2.
    - 3 is not divisible by 2, so is_prime is True.
    - Append 3 to primes.
Third Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 2, 3.
    - 4 is divisible by 2, so is_prime is False.
Fourth Iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4.
    - 5 is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, so is_prime is True.
    - Append 5 to primes.
Fifth Iteration (i=6):
    - `i` is 6, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5.
    - 6 is divisible by 2, 3, so is_prime is False.
Sixth Iteration (i=7):
    - `i` is 7, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
    - 7 is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, so is_prime is True.
    - Append 7 to primes.
Seventh Iteration (i=8):
    - `i` is 8, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
    - 8 is divisible by 2, so is_prime is False.
Eighth Iteration (i=9):
    - `i` is 9, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
    - 9 is divisible by 3, so is_prime is False.
Ninth Iteration (i=10):
    - `i` is 10, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
    - 10 is divisible by 2, 5, so is_prime is False.
Tenth Iteration (i=11):
    - `i` is 11, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
    - 11 is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, so is_prime is True.
    - Append 11 to primes.
Eleventh Iteration (i=12):
    - `i` is 12, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
    - 12 is divisible by 2, 3, so is_prime is False.
Twelfth Iteration (i=13):
    - `i` is 13, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
    - 13 is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, so is_prime is True.
    - Append 13 to primes.
Thirteenth Iteration (i=14):
    - `i` is 14, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
    - 14 is divisible by 2, 7, so is_prime is False.
Fourteenth Iteration (i=15):
    - `i` is 15, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
    - 15 is divisible by 3, 5, so is_prime is False.
Fifteenth Iteration (i=16):
    - `i` is 16, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
    - 16 is divisible by 2, 4, 8, so is_prime is False.
Sixteenth Iteration (i=17):
    - `i` is 17, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
    - 17 is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, so is_prime is True.
    - Append 17 to primes.
