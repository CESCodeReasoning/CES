The function encode takes a string message as input and returns a string with the following transformations:
1. All vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) are replaced with the character 2 positions after them in the alphabet.
2. All other characters are converted to their uppercase counterparts.
To determine the output of executing the function encode on the input "I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE", we need to apply the following transformations:
1. Replace all vowels with the character 2 positions after them in the alphabet.
2. Convert all other characters to their uppercase counterparts.
Applying these transformations, we get the following output:
"L FqP LqOw XqYt tS XqVuE"
