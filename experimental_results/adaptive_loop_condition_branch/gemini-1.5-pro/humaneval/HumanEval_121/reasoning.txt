The function solution takes a list of integers lst as input and returns the sum of all the odd integers at even indices in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [5, 8, 7, 1], we need to first identify the odd integers at even indices in the list.
The first integer in the list is at index 0, which is an even index. The integer at index 0 is 5, which is an odd integer.
The second integer in the list is at index 1, which is an odd index. The integer at index 1 is 8, which is an even integer.
The third integer in the list is at index 2, which is an even index. The integer at index 2 is 7, which is an odd integer.
The fourth integer in the list is at index 3, which is an odd index. The integer at index 3 is 1, which is an odd integer.
Therefore, the odd integers at even indices in the list are 5 and 7.
The sum of 5 and 7 is 12.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [5, 8, 7, 1] is 12.
