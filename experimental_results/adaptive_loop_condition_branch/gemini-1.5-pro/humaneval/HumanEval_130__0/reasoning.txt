The function `tri` is called with ( n = 20 ).
The function first checks if ( n == 0 ), which is not the case here, so it proceeds to the next part.
It initializes a list `my_tri` with the first two elements [1, 3].
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 2 to ( n + 1 ), which is from 2 to 21.
Inside the loop, it checks if ( i % 2 == 0 ), which is true for even numbers.
For even numbers, it appends ( i / 2 + 1 ) to the `my_tri` list.
For odd numbers, it appends ( my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2 ) to the `my_tri` list.
After the loop completes, the function returns the `my_tri` list.
