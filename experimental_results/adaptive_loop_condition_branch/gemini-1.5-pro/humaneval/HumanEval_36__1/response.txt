[REASONING]
The function `fizz_buzz` is called with ( n = 200 ).
Inside the function, an empty list `ns` is initialized.
The loop iterates from 0 through 199 (since ( n = 200 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `ns` remains empty.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which still does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `ns` remains empty.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which still does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `ns` remains empty.
...
Eleventh Iteration (i = 10)
   - `i` is 10, which satisfies ( i % 11 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `ns` is updated to [10].
Twelfth Iteration (i = 11)
   - `i` is 11, which satisfies ( i % 11 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `ns` is updated to [10, 11].
...
One Hundred and Forty-Third Iteration (i = 142)
   - `i` is 142, which satisfies ( i % 11 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `ns` is updated to [10, 11, ..., 142].
One Hundred and Forty-Fourth Iteration (i = 143)
   - `i` is 143, which satisfies ( i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `ns` is updated to [10, 11, ..., 142, 143].
...
Two Hundredth Iteration (i = 199)
   - `i` is 199, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `ns` remains unchanged.
After the loop completes, `ns` contains [10, 11, ..., 142, 143].
The string `s` is created by joining the elements of `ns` as strings, resulting in "1011...142143".
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over each character `c` in `s`.
First Iteration (c = '1')
   - `c` is '1', which is not equal to '7'.
   - The condition `c == '7'` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains 0.
Second Iteration (c = '0')
   - `c` is '0', which is not equal to '7'.
   - The condition `c == '7'` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains 0.
...
Twenty-First Iteration (c = '7')
   - `c` is '7', which is equal to '7'.
   - The condition `c == '7'` is true.
   - Action: `ans` is updated to 1.
...
Forty-Second Iteration (c = '3')
   - `c` is '3', which is not equal to '7'.
   - The condition `c == '7'` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains 1.
After the loop completes, `ans` is 1.
The function returns `ans`, which is 1.
