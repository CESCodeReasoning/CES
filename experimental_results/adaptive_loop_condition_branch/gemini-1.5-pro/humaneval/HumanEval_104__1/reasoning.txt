The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [12345, 2033, 111, 151] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `odd_digit_elements` is initialized.
The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `x`.
First Iteration (i = 12345)
   - The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is evaluated.
   - The condition checks if all the digits in the string representation of `i` are odd.
   - In this case, `str(i)` is '12345', and all the digits are odd, so the condition is true.
   - Action: `odd_digit_elements.append(i)` appends `i` to the `odd_digit_elements` list.
Second Iteration (i = 2033)
   - The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is evaluated.
   - In this case, `str(i)` is '2033', and not all the digits are odd (2 is even), so the condition is false.
   - Action: `i` is not appended to the `odd_digit_elements` list.
Third Iteration (i = 111)
   - The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is evaluated.
   - In this case, `str(i)` is '111', and all the digits are odd, so the condition is true.
   - Action: `odd_digit_elements.append(i)` appends `i` to the `odd_digit_elements` list.
Fourth Iteration (i = 151)
   - The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is evaluated.
   - In this case, `str(i)` is '151', and all the digits are odd, so the condition is true.
   - Action: `odd_digit_elements.append(i)` appends `i` to the `odd_digit_elements` list.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the sorted `odd_digit_elements` list.
