The function `longest` is called with ( strings = ['x', 'y', 'z'] ).
The condition `not strings` is false, so the `if` block is executed.
The variable `maxlen` is set to the maximum length of the strings in the list, which is 1.
The loop iterates over the strings in the list.
First Iteration ( s = 'x' )
   - The length of 'x' is 1, which is equal to `maxlen`.
   - The condition `len(s) == maxlen` is true.
   - Action: The function returns 'x'.
