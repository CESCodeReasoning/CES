[REASONING]
The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] ).
Inside the function, a nested function `isPrime` is defined to check if a number is prime.
The function `skjkasdkd` initializes a variable `maxx` to 0 and a variable `i` to 0.
The loop iterates through the elements of the list `lst`.
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is evaluated.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false (since lst[0] = 0 and maxx = 0).
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true (since 0 is not a prime number).
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is false.
    - The branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is evaluated.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is true (since lst[1] = 8 and maxx = 0).
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true (since 8 is a prime number).
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is true.
    - The branch is taken.
    - The value of `maxx` is updated to 8.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is evaluated.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false (since lst[2] = 1 and maxx = 8).
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true (since 1 is not a prime number).
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is false.
    - The branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is evaluated.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false (since lst[3] = 2 and maxx = 8).
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true (since 2 is a prime number).
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is false.
    - The branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is evaluated.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false (since lst[4] = 1 and maxx = 8).
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true (since 1 is not a prime number).
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is false.
    - The branch is not taken.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is evaluated.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is true (since lst[5] = 7 and maxx = 8).
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true (since 7 is a prime number).
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is true.
    - The branch is taken.
    - The value of `maxx` is updated to 7.
After the loop completes, the value of `maxx` is 7.
The function then calculates the sum of the digits of `maxx` and returns the result.
The sum of the digits of 7 is 7.
