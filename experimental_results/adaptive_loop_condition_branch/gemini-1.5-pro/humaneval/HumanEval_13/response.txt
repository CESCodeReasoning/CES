[REASONING]
The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 3, b = 7 ).
Inside the function, the while loop iterates until b becomes 0.
First Iteration:
    - b = 7, a % b = 3.
    - a and b are updated to ( a = 3, b = 3 ).
Second Iteration:
    - b = 3, a % b = 0.
    - The loop terminates since b is now 0.
The function returns the value of a, which is now 3.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    while b: ## [STATE]b=[7, 3][/STATE]
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
