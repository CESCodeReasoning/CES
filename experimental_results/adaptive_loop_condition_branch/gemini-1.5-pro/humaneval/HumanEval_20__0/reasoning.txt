The function find_closest_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1]) takes a list of float numbers as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by idx in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (idx=0, elem=1.1):
    - Compare 1.1 with 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1:
        - When idx2 = 1 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Since `distance` is None, the if branch of the nested if statement is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 1.1 and 2.2, which is 1.1.
            - Set `closest_pair` to (1.1, 2.2).
        - When idx2 = 2 (elem2=3.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 1.1 and 3.1, which is 2.0.
            - Since the new distance (2.0) is greater than the current distance (1.1), the else branch of the nested if statement is taken.
        - When idx2 = 3 (elem2=4.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 1.1 and 4.1, which is 3.0.
            - Since the new distance (3.0) is greater than the current distance (1.1), the else branch of the nested if statement is taken.
        - When idx2 = 4 (elem2=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 1.1 and 5.1, which is 4.0.
            - Since the new distance (4.0) is greater than the current distance (1.1), the else branch of the nested if statement is taken.
Second Iteration (idx=1, elem=2.2):
    - Compare 2.2 with 3.1, 4.1, 5.1:
        - When idx2 = 2 (elem2=3.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 2.2 and 3.1, which is 0.9.
            - Since the new distance (0.9) is less than the current distance (1.1), the if branch of the nested if statement is taken.
            - Set `closest_pair` to (2.2, 3.1).
        - When idx2 = 3 (elem2=4.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 2.2 and 4.1, which is 1.9.
            - Since the new distance (1.9) is greater than the current distance (0.9), the else branch of the nested if statement is taken.
        - When idx2 = 4 (elem2=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 2.2 and 5.1, which is 2.9.
            - Since the new distance (2.9) is greater than the current distance (0.9), the else branch of the nested if statement is taken.
Third Iteration (idx=2, elem=3.1):
    - Compare 3.1 with 4.1, 5.1:
        - When idx2 = 3 (elem2=4.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 3.1 and 4.1, which is 1.0.
            - Since the new distance (1.0) is greater than the current distance (0.9), the else branch of the nested if statement is taken.
        - When idx2 = 4 (elem2=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 3.1 and 5.1, which is 2.0.
            - Since the new distance (2.0) is greater than the current distance (0.9), the else branch of the nested if statement is taken.
Fourth Iteration (idx=3, elem=4.1):
    - Compare 4.1 with 5.1:
        - When idx2 = 4 (elem2=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 4.1 and 5.1, which is 1.0.
            - Since the new distance (1.0) is greater than the current distance (0.9), the else branch of the nested if statement is taken.
Fifth Iteration (idx=4, elem=5.1):
    - No more elements to compare.
