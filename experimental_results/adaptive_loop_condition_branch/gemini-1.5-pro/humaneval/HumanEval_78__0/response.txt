[REASONING]
The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "2020" ).
Inside the function, a tuple `primes` is defined with the values ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D').
A variable `total` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 to 3 (since ( len(num) = 4 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `num[i]` is '2', which is in `primes`.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` results in `total = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `num[i]` is '0', which is not in `primes`.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `num[i]` is '2', which is in `primes`.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` results in `total = 2`.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `num[i]` is '0', which is not in `primes`.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `total`, which is now 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `hex_key("2020")` is 2.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def hex_key(num):
    primes = ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D')
    total = 0
    for i in range(0, len(num)): ## [STATE]i=[0, 1, 2, 3][/STATE][STATE]range(0, len(num))=[0, 1, 2, 3][/STATE][STATE]len(num)=[4][/STATE]
        if num[i] in primes: ## [CONDITION](num[i] in primes)=[True, False, True, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, N, Y, N][/BRANCH]
            total += 1
    return total
