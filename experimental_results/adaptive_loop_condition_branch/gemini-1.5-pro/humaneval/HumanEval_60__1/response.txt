[REASONING]
The function sum_to_n takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n.
To determine the output of executing the function sum_to_n on the input 100, we need to sum the integers from 1 to 100.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sum_to_n on the input 100 is 5050.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    return sum(range(n + 1))
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
