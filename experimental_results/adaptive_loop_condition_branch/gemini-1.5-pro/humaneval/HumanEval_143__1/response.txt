[REASONING]
The function words_in_sentence(sentence) takes a sentence("go for it") as its parameter.
The function splits the sentence into a list of words.
For each word in the list, the function checks if the length of the word is 1 or if the length of the word is divisible by any number between 2 and the length of the word.
If either of these conditions is true, the function sets a flag to 1.
If the flag is 0 or the length of the word is 2, the function appends the word to a new list.
The function then returns a string that is the concatenation of the words in the new list.
First Iteration (word="go"):
    - `word` is "go", len(word)=2.
    - The condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - The condition `len(word) % i == 0` is False for i=2, the if branch is not taken.
    - The condition `flg == 0 or len(word) == 2` is True, the if branch is taken. Append "go" to new_lst.
Second Iteration (word="for"):
    - `word` is "for", len(word)=3.
    - The condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - The condition `len(word) % i == 0` is True for i=2, the if branch is taken. Set flg to 1.
    - The condition `flg == 0 or len(word) == 2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (word="it"):
    - `word` is "it", len(word)=2.
    - The condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - The condition `len(word) % i == 0` is False for i=2, the if branch is not taken.
    - The condition `flg == 0 or len(word) == 2` is True, the if branch is taken. Append "it" to new_lst.

            new_lst.append(word)
    return " ".join(new_lst)
