[REASONING]
The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "AB" ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 to 1 (since ( len(num) = 2 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `num[i]` is 'A', which is not in primes, so the condition is false.
   - Action: `total` remains 0.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `num[i]` is 'B', which is in primes, so the condition is true.
   - Action: `total` is updated to 1 (`0 + 1 = 1`).
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `total`, which is now 1.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def hex_key(num):
    primes = ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D')
    total = 0 ## [STATE]total=0[/STATE]
    for i in range(0, len(num)): ## [STATE]range(0, len(num))=[0, 1][/STATE][STATE]len(num)=2[/STATE]
        if num[i] in primes: ## [CONDITION](num[i] in primes)=[False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, Y][/BRANCH]
            total += 1
    return total
