The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "AB" ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 to 1 (since ( len(num) = 2 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `num[i]` is 'A', which is not in primes, so the condition is false.
   - Action: `total` remains 0.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `num[i]` is 'B', which is in primes, so the condition is true.
   - Action: `total` is updated to 1 (`0 + 1 = 1`).
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `total`, which is now 1.
