The function `is_multiply_prime` takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` can be expressed as a product of three prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.
The function first defines a helper function `is_prime` that checks if a given number is prime.
A number is prime if it is greater than 1 and is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
The function `is_multiply_prime` then iterates over all possible combinations of three prime numbers and checks if their product is equal to `a`.
If such a combination is found, the function returns `True`.
Otherwise, it returns `False`.

In this case, we are checking if 5 can be expressed as a product of three prime numbers.
The only possible combination of three prime numbers that multiply to 5 is 1 * 5 * 1.
Therefore, the function returns `True`.
