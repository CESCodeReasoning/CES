[REASONING]
The function incr_list takes a list l as input and returns a new list where each element of the input list is incremented by 1.
To determine the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [3, 2, 1], we need to increment each element of the input list by 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [3, 2, 1] is [4, 3, 2].
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def incr_list(l: list):
    return [(e + 1) for e in l]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[4, 3, 2]
[/OUTPUT]
