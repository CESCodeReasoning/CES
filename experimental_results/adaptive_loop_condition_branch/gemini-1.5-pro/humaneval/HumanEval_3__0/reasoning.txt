The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -4, 5, 6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first operation is 1, so balance becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second operation is 2, so balance becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The third operation is -4, so balance becomes -1.
    -Since balance is less than 0, the function returns True.
