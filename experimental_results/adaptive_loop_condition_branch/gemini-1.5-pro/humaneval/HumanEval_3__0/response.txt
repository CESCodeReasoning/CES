[REASONING]
The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -4, 5, 6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first operation is 1, so balance becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second operation is 2, so balance becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The third operation is -4, so balance becomes -1.
    -Since balance is less than 0, the function returns True.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0

    for op in operations: ## [STATE]op=[1, 2, -4][/STATE][STATE]operations=[1, 2, -4, 5, 6][/STATE]
        balance += op
        if balance < 0: ## [CONDITION](balance < 0)=[False, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            return True

    return False

[OUTPUT]
