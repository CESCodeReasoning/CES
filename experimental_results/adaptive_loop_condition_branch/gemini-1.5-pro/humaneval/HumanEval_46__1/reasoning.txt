The function `fib4` is called with ( n = 12 ).
The function initializes a list `results` with the first four Fibonacci numbers: [0, 0, 2, 0].
Since ( n = 12 ) is greater than or equal to 4, the function enters the for loop.
The loop iterates from 4 to 12 (since ( n + 1 = 13 )).
First Iteration ( _ = 4 ):
    `results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4])` appends the sum of the last four elements in `results` to the end of the list.
    `results.pop(0)` removes the first element from `results`.
    `results` is now [0, 2, 2, 4].
Second Iteration ( _ = 5 ):
    `results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4])` appends the sum of the last four elements in `results` to the end of the list.
    `results.pop(0)` removes the first element from `results`.
    `results` is now [2, 2, 4, 6].
Third Iteration ( _ = 6 ):
    `results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4])` appends the sum of the last four elements in `results` to the end of the list.
    `results.pop(0)` removes the first element from `results`.
    `results` is now [2, 4, 6, 8].
Fourth Iteration ( _ = 7 ):
    `results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4])` appends the sum of the last four elements in `results` to the end of the list.
    `results.pop(0)` removes the first element from `results`.
    `results` is now [4, 6, 8, 10].
Fifth Iteration ( _ = 8 ):
    `results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4])` appends the sum of the last four elements in `results` to the end of the list.
    `results.pop(0)` removes the first element from `results`.
    `results` is now [6, 8, 10, 12].
Sixth Iteration ( _ = 9 ):
    `results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4])` appends the sum of the last four elements in `results` to the end of the list.
    `results.pop(0)` removes the first element from `results`.
    `results` is now [8, 10, 12, 14].
Seventh Iteration ( _ = 10 ):
    `results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4])` appends the sum of the last four elements in `results` to the end of the list.
    `results.pop(0)` removes the first element from `results`.
    `results` is now [10, 12, 14, 16].
Eighth Iteration ( _ = 11 ):
    `results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4])` appends the sum of the last four elements in `results` to the end of the list.
    `results.pop(0)` removes the first element from `results`.
    `results` is now [12, 14, 16, 18].
Ninth Iteration ( _ = 12 ):
    `results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4])` appends the sum of the last four elements in `results` to the end of the list.
    `results.pop(0)` removes the first element from `results`.
    `results` is now [14, 16, 18, 20].
After the loop completes, the function returns the last element in `results`, which is 20.
