The function `split_words` is called with ( txt = "Hello world,!" ).
The first condition `if " " in txt` is True, since there is a space in the string.
The first branch is taken.
The string is split by the space, resulting in ['Hello', 'world,!'].
Therefore, the final output of the function `split_words("Hello world,!")` is ['Hello', 'world,!'].
