[REASONING]
The function find_max takes a list of words as input and returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters.
To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["play", "this", "game", "of","footbott"], we need to first sort the list of words by the number of unique characters in each word in descending order.
Then, we need to return the first word in the sorted list.
The number of unique characters in each word can be determined by finding the length of the set of characters in the word.
Therefore, we can sort the list of words by the length of the set of characters in each word in descending order using the key=lambda x: (-len(set(x)), x) argument to the sorted function.
The first word in the sorted list is the word with the maximum number of unique characters.
Therefore, the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["play", "this", "game", "of","footbott"] is "footbott".

[ANSWER]
def find_max(words):
    return sorted(words, key=lambda x: (-len(set(x)), x))[0]
