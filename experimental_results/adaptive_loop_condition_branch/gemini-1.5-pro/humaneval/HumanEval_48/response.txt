[REASONING]
The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'xywyx' ).
Inside the function, a loop iterates from 0 to the length of the text (which is 5).
Iteration 1:
    - The character at index 0 ('x') is equal to the character at index 4 ('x').
Iteration 2:
    - The character at index 1 ('y') is equal to the character at index 3 ('y').
Iteration 3:
    - The character at index 2 ('w') is equal to the character at index 2 ('w').
Iteration 4:
    - The character at index 3 ('y') is equal to the character at index 1 ('y').
Iteration 5:
    - The character at index 4 ('x') is equal to the character at index 0 ('x').
Since all the characters match, the function returns True.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def is_palindrome(text: str): ## [STATE]i=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4][/STATE]
    for i in range(len(text)): ## [STATE]range(len(text))=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4][/STATE][STATE]len(text)=[5][/STATE]
        if text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]: ## [CONDITION](text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i])=[False, False, False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            return False
    return True
