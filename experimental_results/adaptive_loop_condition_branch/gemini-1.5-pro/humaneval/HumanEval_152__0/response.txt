[REASONING]
The function compare takes two lists of integers, game and guess, as input and returns a list of the absolute differences between the corresponding elements in the two lists.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input ([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4]), we need to compute the absolute difference between each corresponding element in the two lists.
Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input ([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4]) is [2,0,0,1].
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def compare(game, guess):
    return [abs(x - y) for x, y in zip(game, guess)]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[2, 0, 0, 1]
[/OUTPUT]
