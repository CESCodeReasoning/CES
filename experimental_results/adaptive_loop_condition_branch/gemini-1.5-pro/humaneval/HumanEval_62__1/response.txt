[REASONING]
The function derivative takes a list of numbers xs as input and returns a list of numbers representing the derivative of xs.
The derivative of a list of numbers is a new list of numbers where each element is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the original list.
To determine the output of executing the function derivative on the input [3, 2, 1], we need to first create a list of numbers where each element is the product of the index and the value at that index in the original list.
This gives us the list [0, 2, 2].
Then, we need to remove the first element of this list, which gives us the list [2, 2].
Therefore, the output of executing the function derivative on the input [3, 2, 1] is [2, 2].
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def derivative(xs: list):
    return [(i * x) for i, x in enumerate(xs)][1:]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[2, 2]
