The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and returns True if n is greater than or equal to 8 and n is even.
To determine the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 13, we need to check if 13 is greater than or equal to 8 and if 13 is even.
13 is greater than or equal to 8, but 13 is not even.
Therefore, the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 13 is False.
