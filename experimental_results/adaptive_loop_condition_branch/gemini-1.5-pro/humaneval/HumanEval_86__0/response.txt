[REASONING]
The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input and returns a new string where each word in s is replaced by the same word with its characters sorted in alphabetical order.
To determine the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input '', we need to split the input string into a list of words, sort the characters in each word, and then join the sorted words back into a single string.
Since the input string is empty, the list of words will be empty, and the output string will also be empty.
Therefore, the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input '' is ''.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def anti_shuffle(s):
    return ' '.join([''.join(sorted(list(i))) for i in s.split(' ')])
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
''
