[REASONING]
The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to `None`.
A list `result` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    - The first element of `numbers` is 1. Since `running_max` is `None`, it is set to 1.
    - The value of `running_max` (1) is appended to `result`.

Iteration 2:
    - The second element of `numbers` is 2. Since `running_max` is not `None`, it is compared with 2. The maximum of 2 and 1 is 2, so `running_max` is updated to 2.
    - The value of `running_max` (2) is appended to `result`.

Iteration 3:
    - The third element of `numbers` is 3. Since `running_max` is not `None`, it is compared with 3. The maximum of 3 and 2 is 3, so `running_max` is updated to 3.
    - The value of `running_max` (3) is appended to `result`.

Iteration 4:
    - The fourth element of `numbers` is 4. Since `running_max` is not `None`, it is compared with 4. The maximum of 4 and 3 is 4, so `running_max` is updated to 4.
    - The value of `running_max` (4) is appended to `result`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the list `result`, which contains the running maximum values for each element in `numbers`.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    running_max = None
    result = []

    for n in numbers: ## [STATE]n=[1, 2, 3, 4][/STATE][STATE]numbers=[1, 2, 3, 4][/STATE]
        if running_max is None: ## [CONDITION](running_max is None)=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
            running_max = n
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            running_max = max(running_max, n)

        result.append(running_max)

    return result
