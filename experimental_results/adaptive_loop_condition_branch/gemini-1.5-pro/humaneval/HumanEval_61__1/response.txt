[REASONING]
The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "(" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over each character `b` in the string `brackets`.
First Iteration (b = "(")
   - The character `b` is "(", so the condition `b == "("` is true.
   - Action: `depth += 1` updates `depth` to 1 (`0 + 1 = 1`).
Second Iteration (b = ")")
   - The character `b` is ")", so the condition `b == "("` is false.
   - Action: `depth -= 1` updates `depth` to 0 (`1 - 1 = 0`).
   - The condition `depth < 0` is false.
The loop completes, and the function returns `depth == 0`, which is true.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets: ## [STATE]b=["(", ")"][/STATE][STATE]brackets=["("][/STATE]
        if b == "(": ## [CONDITION](b == "(")=[True, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, N][/BRANCH]
            depth += 1
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N, Y][/BRANCH]
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0: ## [CONDITION](depth < 0)=[False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, Y][/BRANCH]
            return False
    return depth == 0
