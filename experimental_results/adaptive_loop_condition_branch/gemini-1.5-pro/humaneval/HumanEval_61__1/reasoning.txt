The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "(" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over each character `b` in the string `brackets`.
First Iteration (b = "(")
   - The character `b` is "(", so the condition `b == "("` is true.
   - Action: `depth += 1` updates `depth` to 1 (`0 + 1 = 1`).
Second Iteration (b = ")")
   - The character `b` is ")", so the condition `b == "("` is false.
   - Action: `depth -= 1` updates `depth` to 0 (`1 - 1 = 0`).
   - The condition `depth < 0` is false.
The loop completes, and the function returns `depth == 0`, which is true.
