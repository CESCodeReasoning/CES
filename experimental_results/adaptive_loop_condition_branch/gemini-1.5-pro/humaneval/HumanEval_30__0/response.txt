[REASONING]
The function get_positive takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the positive numbers from the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input list [5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], we need to iterate over the input list and check if each element is greater than 0.
If an element is greater than 0, we add it to the new list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input list [5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] is [5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1].
