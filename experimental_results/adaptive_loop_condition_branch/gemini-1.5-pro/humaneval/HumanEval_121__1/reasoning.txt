The function solution takes a list of integers lst as input and returns the sum of all the odd integers at even indices in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32], we need to first identify the odd integers at even indices in the list.
The first integer in the list, 30, is at an even index (index 0) but is not odd.
The second integer in the list, 13, is at an even index (index 1) and is odd.
The third integer in the list, 23, is at an odd index (index 2) and is odd.
The fourth integer in the list, 32, is at an even index (index 3) but is not odd.
Therefore, the sum of all the odd integers at even indices in the list is 13 + 23 = 36.
