The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [15, 33, 1422, 1] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `odd_digit_elements` is initialized.
The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `x`.
First Iteration (i = 15)
   - The condition `all (int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is checked.
   - The condition is false because '5' is an even digit.
   - Action: `i` is not added to `odd_digit_elements`.
Second Iteration (i = 33)
   - The condition `all (int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is checked.
   - The condition is true because both '3' are odd digits.
   - Action: `i` is added to `odd_digit_elements`.
Third Iteration (i = 1422)
   - The condition `all (int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is checked.
   - The condition is false because '2' and '4' are even digits.
   - Action: `i` is not added to `odd_digit_elements`.
Fourth Iteration (i = 1)
   - The condition `all (int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is checked.
   - The condition is true because '1' is an odd digit.
   - Action: `i` is added to `odd_digit_elements`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the sorted `odd_digit_elements`, which is [1, 33].
