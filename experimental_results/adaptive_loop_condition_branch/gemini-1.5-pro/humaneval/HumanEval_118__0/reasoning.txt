The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "full" ).
The length of the word is 4, which is greater than or equal to 3.
The loop iterates from ( len(word) - 2 ) to 1, decrementing by 1 in each iteration.
Iteration 1:
    - i = 2
    - word[i] = 'l'
    - 'l' is not in vowels
Iteration 2:
    - i = 1
    - word[i] = 'u'
    - 'u' is in vowels
    - word[i + 1] = 'l' is not in vowels
    - word[i - 1] = 'f' is not in vowels
    - The condition is true, so the function returns 'u'.
