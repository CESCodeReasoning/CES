The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` is initialized to 0 and `s` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of nums is 2.
    -s becomes -2.
    -s is less than 0, so s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is still 0.

Iteration 2:
    -The second element of nums is 3.
    -s becomes -3.
    -s is less than 0, so s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is still 0.

Iteration 3:
    -The third element of nums is 4.
    -s becomes -4.
    -s is less than 0, so s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is still 0.

Iteration 4:
    -The fourth element of nums is 1.
    -s becomes -1.
    -s is less than 0, so s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is still 0.

Iteration 5:
    -The fifth element of nums is 2.
    -s becomes -2.
    -s is less than 0, so s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is still 0.

Iteration 6:
    -The sixth element of nums is 4.
    -s becomes -4.
    -s is less than 0, so s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is still 0.

After the loop, max_sum is still 0.
Since max_sum is 0, the function calculates the maximum of the negative of each element in nums.
The maximum of the negative of each element in nums is -2.
The negative of -2 is 2, which is the minimum subarray sum.
