[REASONING]
The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` is initialized to 0 and `s` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of nums is 2.
    -s becomes -2.
    -s is less than 0, so s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is still 0.

Iteration 2:
    -The second element of nums is 3.
    -s becomes -3.
    -s is less than 0, so s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is still 0.

Iteration 3:
    -The third element of nums is 4.
    -s becomes -4.
    -s is less than 0, so s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is still 0.

Iteration 4:
    -The fourth element of nums is 1.
    -s becomes -1.
    -s is less than 0, so s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is still 0.

Iteration 5:
    -The fifth element of nums is 2.
    -s becomes -2.
    -s is less than 0, so s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is still 0.

Iteration 6:
    -The sixth element of nums is 4.
    -s becomes -4.
    -s is less than 0, so s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is still 0.

After the loop, max_sum is still 0.
Since max_sum is 0, the function calculates the maximum of the negative of each element in nums.
The maximum of the negative of each element in nums is -2.
The negative of -2 is 2, which is the minimum subarray sum.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    max_sum = 0
    s = 0 ## [STATE]num=[2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4][/STATE]
    for num in nums: ## [STATE]nums=[2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4][/STATE]
        s += -num
        if (s < 0): ## [CONDITION](s < 0)=[True, True, True, True, True, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            s = 0
        max_sum = max(s, max_sum)
    if max_sum == 0: ## [CONDITION](max_sum == 0)=[Y][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        max_sum = max(-i for i in nums)
    min_sum = -max_sum
    return min_sum
