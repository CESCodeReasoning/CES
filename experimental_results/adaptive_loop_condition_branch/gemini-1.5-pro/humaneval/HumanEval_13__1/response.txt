[REASONING]
The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 144, b = 60 ).
First Iteration:
    - b = 60, a % b = 144 % 60 = 24.
    - a = 60, b = 24.
Second Iteration:
    - b = 24, a % b = 60 % 24 = 12.
    - a = 24, b = 12.
Third Iteration:
    - b = 12, a % b = 24 % 12 = 0.
    - a = 12, b = 0.
b is 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of a, which is now 12.

from typing import *


def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    while b: ## [STATE]b=[60, 24, 12, 0][/STATE]
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
