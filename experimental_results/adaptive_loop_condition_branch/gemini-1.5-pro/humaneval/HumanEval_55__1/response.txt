[REASONING]
The function `fib` is called with ( n = 11 ).
The first condition ( n == 0 ) is false, so the first branch is not taken.
The second condition ( n == 1 ) is also false, so the second branch is not taken.
Therefore, the function proceeds to the recursive case.
The function calls itself with ( n = 10 ), which in turn calls itself with ( n = 9 ), and so on, until it reaches the base case ( n = 0 ).
At this point, the function returns 0.
The function then backtracks, returning the sum of the results of the two recursive calls.
For example, when the function returns from the call with ( n = 10 ), it returns 0 + 1 = 1.
When the function returns from the call with ( n = 11 ), it returns 1 + 1 = 2.
Therefore, the final output of the function `fib(11)` is 2.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def fib(n: int):
    if n == 0: ## [CONDITION](n == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return 0
    if n == 1: ## [CONDITION](n == 1)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return 1
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
