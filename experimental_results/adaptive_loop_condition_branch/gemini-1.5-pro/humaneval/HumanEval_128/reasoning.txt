The function `prod_signs` is called with ( arr = [1, 2, 2, -4] ).
First, the function checks if the array is empty. Since the array is not empty, the function proceeds to calculate the product of the signs of the negative numbers in the array and the sum of the absolute values of all the numbers in the array.
The function first checks if there is a 0 in the array. Since there is no 0 in the array, the function proceeds to calculate the product of the signs of the negative numbers in the array.
The function uses the `filter` function to create a new array containing only the negative numbers in the array. The `len` function is then used to calculate the number of negative numbers in the array. The `**` operator is then used to raise -1 to the power of the number of negative numbers in the array. This results in a value of 1 if there are an even number of negative numbers in the array and -1 if there are an odd number of negative numbers in the array.
The function then calculates the sum of the absolute values of all the numbers in the array using a list comprehension.
The function then returns the product of the signs of the negative numbers in the array and the sum of the absolute values of all the numbers in the array.
Therefore, the final output of the function `prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4])` is -12.
