The function `numerical_letter_grade` is called with ( grades = [1.2] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `letter_grade` is initialized.
The loop iterates over the elements in `grades`.
First Iteration (gpa = 1.2)
   - The condition `gpa == 4.0` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 3.7` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 3.3` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 3.0` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 2.7` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 2.3` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 2.0` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 1.7` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 1.3` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 1.0` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 0.7` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 0.0` is true.
   - Action: `letter_grade.append("D-")` adds "D-" to `letter_grade`.
