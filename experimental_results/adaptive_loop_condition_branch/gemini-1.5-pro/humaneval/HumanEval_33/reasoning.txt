The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a new list where the elements at indices 0, 3, 6, ... are sorted.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to first make a copy of the list l.
Then, we need to sort the elements at indices 0, 3, 6, ... of the copy of l.
Finally, we need to return the sorted copy of l.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3].
