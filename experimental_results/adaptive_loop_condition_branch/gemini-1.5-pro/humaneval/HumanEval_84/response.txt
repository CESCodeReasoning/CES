[REASONING]
The function solve takes an integer N as input and returns the binary representation of the sum of the digits of N.
To determine the output of executing the function solve on the input 1000, we need to first convert 1000 to a string, which is "1000".
Then, we need to iterate over the characters in the string "1000" and convert each character to an integer.
The sum of the integers is 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.
Finally, we need to convert the integer 1 to its binary representation, which is "1".
Therefore, the output of executing the function solve on the input 1000 is "1".

[ANSWER]
def solve(N):
    # Convert N to a string
    N_str = str(N)
    # Initialize the sum of the digits to 0
    sum_digits = 0
    # Iterate over the characters in the string
    for i in N_str:
        # Convert the character to an integer
        digit = int(i)
        # Add the digit to the sum of the digits
        sum_digits += digit
    # Convert the sum of the digits to a binary string
    binary_str = bin(sum_digits)[2:]
    # Return the binary string
    return binary_str
