[REASONING]
The function get_row takes a list of lists lst and an element x as input, and returns a list of the coordinates of all occurrences of x in lst, sorted first by column and then by row.
To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3, we need to find all occurrences of 3 in the list of lists and sort them first by column and then by row.
The first occurrence of 3 is at index (2, 2) in the list of lists.
The second occurrence of 3 is at index (2, 1) in the list of lists.
Therefore, the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3 is [(2, 2), (2, 1)].

[ANSWER]
def get_row(lst, x):
    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst))
              for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
    return sorted(
        sorted(
            coords,
            key=lambda x: x[1],
            reverse=True),
        key=lambda x: x[0])
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[(2, 2), (2, 1)]
