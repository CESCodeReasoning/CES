The function `count_nums` is called with ( arr = [1] ).
The function `count_nums` calls the function `digits_sum` with ( n = 1 ).
`n` is not less than 0, so the if branch is not taken.
The function `digits_sum` returns the sum of the digits of `n`, which is 1.
The function `count_nums` filters the list of the results of applying the function `digits_sum` to each element of `arr` to keep only the positive numbers.
The resulting list has one element, so the function `count_nums` returns 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `count_nums([1])` is 1.
