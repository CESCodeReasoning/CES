[REASONING]
The function `encrypt` is called with ( s = 'et' ).
Inside the function, a variable `out` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.
First Iteration (c = 'e')
   - `c` is in the string `d`, so the condition `c in d` is true.
   - The index of `c` in `d` is 4.
   - The expression `(d.index(c) + 2 * 2) % 26` evaluates to 8.
   - The character at index 8 in `d` is 'i'.
   - The character 'i' is appended to `out`.
Second Iteration (c = 't')
   - `c` is in the string `d`, so the condition `c in d` is true.
   - The index of `c` in `d` is 19.
   - The expression `(d.index(c) + 2 * 2) % 26` evaluates to 23.
   - The character at index 23 in `d` is 'x'.
   - The character 'x' is appended to `out`.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def encrypt(s):
    d = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    out = ''
    for c in s: ## [STATE]c=['e', 't'][/STATE][STATE]s=['et'][/STATE]
        if c in d: ## [CONDITION](c in d)=[True, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            out += d[(d.index(c) + 2 * 2) % 26]
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N, N][/BRANCH]
            out += c
    return out
