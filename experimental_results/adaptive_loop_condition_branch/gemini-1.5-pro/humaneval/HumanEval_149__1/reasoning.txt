The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order.
Then, a new list `new_lst` is created.
The loop iterates over each element `i` in the sorted list `lst`.
First Iteration (i = "AI")
   - The length of "AI" is 2, which is even.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: "AI" is appended to `new_lst`.
Second Iteration (i = "b")
   - The length of "b" is 1, which is odd.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: "b" is not appended to `new_lst`.
Third Iteration (i = "asdf")
   - The length of "asdf" is 4, which is even.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: "asdf" is appended to `new_lst`.
Fourth Iteration (i = "school")
   - The length of "school" is 6, which is even.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: "school" is appended to `new_lst`.
After the loop completes, the list `new_lst` contains ["AI", "asdf", "school"].
Finally, the list `new_lst` is sorted again, this time by the length of its elements.
The final result is ["AI", "b", "asdf", "school"].
