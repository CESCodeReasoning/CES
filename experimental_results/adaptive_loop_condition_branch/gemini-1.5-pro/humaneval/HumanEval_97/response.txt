[REASONING]
The function multiply takes two integers a and b as input and returns the product of the last digits of a and b.
To determine the output of executing the function multiply on the input 148 and 412, we need to find the last digits of 148 and 412, which are 8 and 2, respectively.
Then, we need to multiply 8 and 2, which gives us 16.
Therefore, the output of executing the function multiply on the input 148 and 412 is 16.
