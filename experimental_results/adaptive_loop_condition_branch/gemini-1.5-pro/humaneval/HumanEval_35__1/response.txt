[REASONING]
The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [3, 2, -3.5, 0] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list, which is 3.
The loop iterates through the list, starting from the second element.
First Iteration (e = 2)
   - `e` is 2, which is less than `m` (3).
   - The condition `e > m` is false.
   - Action: No action is taken.
Second Iteration (e = -3.5)
   - `e` is -3.5, which is less than `m` (3).
   - The condition `e > m` is false.
   - Action: No action is taken.
Third Iteration (e = 0)
   - `e` is 0, which is less than `m` (3).
   - The condition `e > m` is false.
   - Action: No action is taken.
Since no element in the list is greater than the initial value of `m`, the function returns `m`, which is 3.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def max_element(l: list):
    m = l[0]
    for e in l: ## [STATE]e=[2, -3.5, 0][/STATE][STATE]l=[3, 2, -3.5, 0][/STATE]
        if e > m: ## [CONDITION](e > m)=[False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            m = e
    return m
