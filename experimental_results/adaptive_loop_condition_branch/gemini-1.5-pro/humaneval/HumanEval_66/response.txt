[REASONING]
The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "You arE Very Smart" ).
The string `s` is not empty, so the if branch is not taken.
The function returns the sum of the ASCII values of the uppercase characters in the string.
The uppercase characters in the string are 'E', 'V', 'S', and 'M', which have ASCII values of 69, 86, 83, and 77, respectively.
The sum of these values is 69 + 86 + 83 + 77 = 315.
Therefore, the final output of the function `digitSum("You arE Very Smart")` is 315.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def digitSum(s):
    if s == "": return 0 ## [CONDITION](s == "")=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
    return sum(ord(char) if char.isupper() else 0 for char in s)[/CODE]

[OUTPUT]
315
