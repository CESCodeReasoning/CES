The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = '0' ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is assigned the length of the string, which is 1.
The first conditional statement checks if the length of the string is 0 or 1. Since the length is 1, the condition is true.
The function returns False because a string with length 0 or 1 is not considered a prime length.
