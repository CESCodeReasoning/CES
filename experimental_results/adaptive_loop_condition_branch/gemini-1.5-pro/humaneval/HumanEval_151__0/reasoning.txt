The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the odd positive integers in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [-10, -20, -30], we need to first filter out the numbers that are not odd positive integers.
The numbers that are not odd positive integers are -10, -20, and -30.
Therefore, the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [-10, -20, -30] is 0.
