[REASONING]
The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the odd positive integers in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [-10, -20, -30], we need to first filter out the numbers that are not odd positive integers.
The numbers that are not odd positive integers are -10, -20, and -30.
Therefore, the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [-10, -20, -30] is 0.

[ANSWER]
def double_the_difference(lst):
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i %
               2 != 0 and "." not in str(i)])
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
0
