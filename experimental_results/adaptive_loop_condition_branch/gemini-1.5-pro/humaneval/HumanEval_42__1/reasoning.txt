The function incr_list takes a list l as input and returns a new list where each element of the input list is incremented by 1.
To determine the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [], we need to create a new list where each element of the input list is incremented by 1.
Since the input list is empty, the output list will also be empty.
Therefore, the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [] is [].
