The function `fizz_buzz` is called with ( n = 100000 ).
Inside the function, an empty list `ns` is initialized.
The loop iterates from 0 through 99999 (since ( n = 100000 )).

   - Action: `ns` is updated to [11].
Thirteenth Iteration (i = 12)
   - `i` is 12, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `ns` is not modified.
...
Twenty-second Iteration (i = 22)
   - `i` is 22, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `ns` is not modified.
Twenty-third Iteration (i = 23)
   - `i` is 23, which satisfies ( i % 11 == 0 ).

   - `i` is 90, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `ns` is not modified.
Ninety-second Iteration (i = 91)
   - `i` is 91, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `ns` is not modified.
...
One-hundredth Iteration (i = 99)
   - `i` is 99, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `ns` is not modified.
One-hundred-and-first Iteration (i = 100)
   - `i` is 100, which satisfies ( i % 11 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `ns` is updated to [11, 23, 100].
...
Nine-hundred-and-ninety-ninth Iteration (i = 998)
   - `i` is 998, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `ns` is not modified.
One-thousandth Iteration (i = 999)
   - `i` is 999, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `ns` is not modified.
After the loop completes, `ns` contains [11, 23, 100, 110, 121, 132, 220, 231, 330, 440, 550, 660, 770, 880, 990].
The string `s` is then created by joining the elements of `ns` as strings, resulting in "1123100110121132220231330440550660770880990".
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over each character `c` in `s`.
First Iteration (c = '1')
   - `c` is '1', which is not equal to '7'.
   - The condition `c == '7'` is false.
   - Action: `ans` is not modified.
Second Iteration (c = '1')
   - `c` is '1', which is not equal to '7'.
   - The condition `c == '7'` is false.
   - Action: `ans` is not modified.
Third Iteration (c = '2')
   - `c` is '2', which is not equal to '7'.
   - The condition `c == '7'` is false.
   - Action: `ans` is not modified.
...
Eighth Iteration (c = '3')
   - `c` is '3', which is not equal to '7'.
   - The condition `c == '7'` is false.
   - Action: `ans` is not modified.

   - `c` is '0', which is not equal to '7'.
   - The condition `c == '7'` is false.
   - Action: `ans` is not modified.
...
Seventeenth Iteration (c = '7')
   - `c` is '7', which is equal to '7'.
   - The condition `c == '7'` is true.
   - Action: `ans` is updated to 1.
Eighteenth Iteration (c = '7')
   - `c` is '7', which is equal to '7'.
   - The condition `c == '7'` is true.
   - Action: `ans` is updated to 2.
...
Twenty-fifth Iteration (c = '0')
   - `c` is '0', which is not equal to '7'.
   - The condition `c == '7'` is false.
   - Action: `ans` is not modified.
