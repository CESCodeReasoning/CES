The function `median` is called with the list `l = [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]`.
The list `l` is sorted in ascending order, resulting in `l = [-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000]`.
The length of the sorted list `l` is 6, which is even.
The condition `len(l) % 2 == 1` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
The median of the list is calculated as the average of the two middle elements, which are `l[len(l) // 2 - 1] = 10` and `l[len(l) // 2] = 20`.
The median is `(10 + 20) / 2.0 = 15.0`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])` is 15.0.
