The function cycpattern_check(a, b) takes two strings as its parameters.
The function checks if the string b is a cyclic pattern of string a.
A cyclic pattern means that the string b can be formed by concatenating multiple copies of string a.
The function first calculates the length of string b and stores it in the variable l.
Then, it creates a new string pat by concatenating string b with itself.
The function then iterates over the string a using a for loop.
For each iteration, the function checks if the substring of string a starting at index i and ending at index i + l is equal to the substring of string pat starting at index j and ending at index j + l.
If the two substrings are equal, the function returns True.
Otherwise, the function continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns False.
In this case, a="efef" and b="fee".
The length of b is 3, so l=3.
The string pat is "feefee".
The function iterates over the string a using a for loop.
The first iteration of the loop sets i=0.
The function then iterates over the string pat using a nested for loop.
The first iteration of the nested loop sets j=0.
The function checks if the substring of string a starting at index i and ending at index i + l is equal to the substring of string pat starting at index j and ending at index j + l.
In this case, the substring of string a is "efe" and the substring of string pat is "fee".
The two substrings are not equal, so the function continues to the next iteration of the nested loop.
The second iteration of the nested loop sets j=1.
The function checks if the substring of string a starting at index i and ending at index i + l is equal to the substring of string pat starting at index j and ending at index j + l.
In this case, the substring of string a is "efe" and the substring of string pat is "fef".
The two substrings are not equal, so the function continues to the next iteration of the nested loop.
The third iteration of the nested loop sets j=2.
The function checks if the substring of string a starting at index i and ending at index i + l is equal to the substring of string pat starting at index j and ending at index j + l.
In this case, the substring of string a is "efe" and the substring of string pat is "fee".
The two substrings are equal, so the function returns True.
