The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 12, shift = 1 ).
The string representation of `x` is `s = "12"`.
The condition `shift > len(s)` is false, since `shift = 1` and `len(s) = 2`.
Therefore, the else branch is taken.
The expression `s[len(s) - shift:]` evaluates to `"2"`.
The expression `s[:len(s) - shift]` evaluates to `"1"`.
The concatenation of these two expressions results in `"21"`, which is returned by the function.

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(12, 1)` is `"21"`.
