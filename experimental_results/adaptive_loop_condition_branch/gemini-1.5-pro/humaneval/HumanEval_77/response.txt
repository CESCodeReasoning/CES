[REASONING]
The function iscube takes an integer a as input and returns True if a is a perfect cube, and False otherwise.
To determine if a is a perfect cube, the function first takes the absolute value of a and stores it in a.
Then, the function rounds a to the nearest integer and raises it to the power of 1/3.
The result is then rounded to the nearest integer and raised to the power of 3.
If the result is equal to a, then a is a perfect cube and the function returns True.
Otherwise, the function returns False.
To determine the output of executing the function iscube on the input 1, we need to follow the steps described above.
First, we take the absolute value of 1, which is 1.
Then, we round 1 to the nearest integer, which is 1.
Next, we raise 1 to the power of 1/3, which is 1.
Then, we round 1 to the nearest integer, which is 1.
Finally, we raise 1 to the power of 3, which is 1.
Since the result is equal to 1, we know that 1 is a perfect cube and the function returns True.

[ANSWER]
def iscube(a):
    a = abs(a)
    # [STATE] a = 1 [/STATE]
    return int(round(a ** (1. / 3))) ** 3 == a
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
True
