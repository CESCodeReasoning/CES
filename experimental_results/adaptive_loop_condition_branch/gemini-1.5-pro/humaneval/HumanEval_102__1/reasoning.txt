The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 33, y = 12354 ).
The first condition `x > y` is false, so the if branch is not taken.
The second condition `y % 2 == 0` is true, so the if branch is taken and the method returns y.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(33, 12354)` is 12354.
