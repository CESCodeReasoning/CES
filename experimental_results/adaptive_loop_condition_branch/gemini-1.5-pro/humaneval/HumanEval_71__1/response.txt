[REASONING]
The function `triangle_area` is called with ( a = 1, b = 2, c = 10 ).
The first condition `a + b <= c` is false because 1 + 2 is not less than or equal to 10.
The second condition `a + c <= b` is false because 1 + 10 is not less than or equal to 2.
The third condition `b + c <= a` is false because 2 + 10 is not less than or equal to 1.
Since all three conditions are false, the if branch is not taken and the function returns -1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `triangle_area(1, 2, 10)` is -1.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a: ## [CONDITION](a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a)=[False or False or False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](b + c <= a)=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](a + b <= c)=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](a + c <= b)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return -1
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
    area = round(area, 2)
    return area
