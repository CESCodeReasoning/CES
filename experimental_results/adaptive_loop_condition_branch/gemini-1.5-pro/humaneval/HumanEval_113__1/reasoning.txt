The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['271', '137', '314']).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to [].
The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
First Iteration (arr = '271'):
    `sum(int(d) % 2 == 1 for d in arr)` counts the number of odd digits in '271'.
    The result is 2 since '2' and '7' are odd digits.
    `res.append(...)` appends the following string to `res`:
    "the number of odd elements 2n the str2ng 2 of the 2nput."
Second Iteration (arr = '137'):
    `sum(int(d) % 2 == 1 for d in arr)` counts the number of odd digits in '137'.
    The result is 2 since '1' and '7' are odd digits.
    `res.append(...)` appends the following string to `res`:
    "the number of odd elements 2n the str2ng 2 of the 2nput."
Third Iteration (arr = '314'):
    `sum(int(d) % 2 == 1 for d in arr)` counts the number of odd digits in '314'.
    The result is 1 since '1' is the only odd digit.
    `res.append(...)` appends the following string to `res`:
    "the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput."
