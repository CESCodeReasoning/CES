[REASONING]
The function multiply takes two integers a and b as input and returns the product of the last digits of a and b.
To determine the output of executing the function multiply on the input 76 and 67, we need to find the last digits of 76 and 67, which are 6 and 7, respectively.
Then, we need to multiply 6 and 7, which gives us 42.
Therefore, the output of executing the function multiply on the input 76 and 67 is 42.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def multiply(a, b):
    return abs(a % 10) * abs(b % 10)
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
42
