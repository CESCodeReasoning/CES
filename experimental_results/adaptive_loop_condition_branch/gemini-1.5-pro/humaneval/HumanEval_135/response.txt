[REASONING]
The function `can_arrange` is called with the list `arr = [1,2,4,3,5]`.
The function initializes a variable `ind` to -1.
The loop iterates from 1 to 4 (since `len(arr) = 5`).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    - `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` is false when `i = 1` because `arr[1] = 2` and `arr[0] = 1`.
    - The branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` is false when `i = 2` because `arr[2] = 4` and `arr[1] = 2`.
    - The branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` is true when `i = 3` because `arr[3] = 3` and `arr[2] = 4`.
    - The branch is taken.
    - `ind` is updated to 3.
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    - `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` is false when `i = 4` because `arr[4] = 5` and `arr[3] = 3`.
    - The branch is not taken.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is now 3.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def can_arrange(arr):
    ind=-1
    i=1
    while i<len(arr): ## [STATE]i=[1, 2, 3, 4][/STATE][STATE]len(arr)=[5][/STATE]
      if arr[i]<arr[i-1]: ## [CONDITION](arr[i]<arr[i-1])=[False, False, True, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, Y, N][/BRANCH]
        ind=i
      i+=1
    return ind
