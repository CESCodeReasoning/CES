The function `is_multiply_prime` takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` can be expressed as a product of three prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.
The function first defines a helper function `is_prime` that checks if a given number is prime.
The function `is_multiply_prime` then iterates over all possible triples of prime numbers (i, j, k) and checks if their product is equal to `a`.
If such a triple is found, the function returns `True`.
Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

For the input `a = 125`, the function `is_multiply_prime` first checks if `a` is prime.
Since `a` is not prime, the function proceeds to check if `a` can be expressed as a product of three prime numbers.
The function first checks if `a` can be expressed as a product of two prime numbers.
Since `a` is not divisible by any prime number, the function proceeds to check if `a` can be expressed as a product of three prime numbers.
