The function `largest_prime_factor` is called with ( n = 330 ).
Inside the function, a nested function `is_prime` is defined to check if a number is prime.
The function `largest_prime_factor` initializes a variable `largest` to 1.
The loop iterates from 2 through 330 (since ( n = 330 )).
First Iteration (j = 2)
   - `j` is 2, which is prime (as checked by the `is_prime` function).
   - `n % j == 0` is true (since 330 is divisible by 2).
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is true.
   - Action: `largest` is updated to 2 (since 2 is the largest prime factor found so far).
Second Iteration (j = 3)

   - Action: `largest` is updated to 3 (since 3 is the largest prime factor found so far).
Third Iteration (j = 4)
