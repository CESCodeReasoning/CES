The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [0] ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 % 3 == 0 ).
    - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` appends 0 to `result`.

Return Statement:
    - After the loop completes, the function returns the sum of the elements in `result`, which is 0.
