[REASONING]
The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with ( paren_string = '()()((((()()((()))))()()()))' ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list, `current_string` is initialized to an empty list, and `current_depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The character 'c' is '(', so the condition `c == '('` is true.
    - The current depth is incremented by 1, and the character '(' is appended to `current_string`.

Iteration 2:
    - The character 'c' is ')', so the condition `c == '('` is false.
    - The current depth is decremented by 1, and the character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    - The condition `current_depth == 0` is false, so the `if` block is skipped.

    - The character 'c' is '(', so the condition `c == '('` is true.
    - The current depth is incremented by 1, and the character '(' is appended to `current_string`.
