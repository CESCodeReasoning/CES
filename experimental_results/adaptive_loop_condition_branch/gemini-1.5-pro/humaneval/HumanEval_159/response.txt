[REASONING]
The function `eat` is called with ( number = 5, need = 6, remaining = 10 ).
The condition `need <= remaining` is true ( 6 <= 10 ).
The if branch is taken and the function returns `[ number + need , remaining-need ]`.
The result is `[ 5 + 6 , 10 - 6 ]` which is `[ 11 , 4 ]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `eat(5, 6, 10)` is `[ 11 , 4 ]`.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    if(need <= remaining): ## [CONDITION](need <= remaining)=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return [ number + need , remaining-need ]
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return [ number + remaining , 0]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[11, 4]
