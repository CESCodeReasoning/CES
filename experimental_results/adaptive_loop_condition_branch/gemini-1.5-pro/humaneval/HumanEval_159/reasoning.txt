The function `eat` is called with ( number = 5, need = 6, remaining = 10 ).
The condition `need <= remaining` is true ( 6 <= 10 ).
The if branch is taken and the function returns `[ number + need , remaining-need ]`.
The result is `[ 5 + 6 , 10 - 6 ]` which is `[ 11 , 4 ]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `eat(5, 6, 10)` is `[ 11 , 4 ]`.
