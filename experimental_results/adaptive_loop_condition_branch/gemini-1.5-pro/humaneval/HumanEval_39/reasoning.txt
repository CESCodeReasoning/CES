The function `prime_fib` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, a list `f` is initialized with the first two Fibonacci numbers ( 0 and 1 ).
The function `is_prime` is defined to check if a number is prime.
The loop continues to generate Fibonacci numbers until `n` prime Fibonacci numbers are found.
First Iteration:
    - The next Fibonacci number is 1 ( 0 + 1 ).
    - The function `is_prime` is called with ( p = 1 ).
    - The condition `p < 2` is true.
    - The function `is_prime` returns False.
    - The Fibonacci number 1 is not prime.
Second Iteration:
    - The next Fibonacci number is 1 ( 1 + 0 ).
    - The function `is_prime` is called with ( p = 1 ).
    - The condition `p < 2` is true.
    - The function `is_prime` returns False.
    - The Fibonacci number 1 is not prime.
Third Iteration:
    - The next Fibonacci number is 2 ( 1 + 1 ).
    - The function `is_prime` is called with ( p = 2 ).
    - The condition `p < 2` is false.
    - The loop iterates from 2 to 1 (since ( int(math.sqrt(2)) + 1 = 2 )).
    - The condition `p % k == 0` is false for all values of k.
    - The function `is_prime` returns True.
    - The Fibonacci number 2 is prime.
    - The value of `n` is decremented to 0 (since ( n = 1 )).
    - The loop terminates.
The function returns the last Fibonacci number generated, which is 2.
