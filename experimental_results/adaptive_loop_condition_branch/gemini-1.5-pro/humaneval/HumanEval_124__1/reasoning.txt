The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '04-2003' ).
The date is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, resulting in '04-2003'.
The date is then split into three parts: month, day, and year, using the '-' character as the separator.
The resulting parts are converted to integers: month = 4, day = 2003, and year = 2003.
The month is checked to be between 1 and 12, which it is (4 is between 1 and 12).
The month is then checked to be in the set [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12], and the day is checked to be between 1 and 31.
Since the month is 4, which is not in the set [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12], this check is skipped.
The month is then checked to be in the set [4, 6, 9, 11], and the day is checked to be between 1 and 30.
Since the month is 4, which is in the set [4, 6, 9, 11], the day is checked to be between 1 and 30.
The day is 2003, which is not between 1 and 30, so the function returns False.
