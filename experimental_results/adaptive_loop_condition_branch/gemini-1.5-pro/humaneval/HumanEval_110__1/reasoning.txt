The function `exchange` is called with two lists: `lst1 = [100, 200]` and `lst2 = [200, 200]`.
Inside the function, two variables `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.
The first loop iterates over the elements of `lst1`.
Iteration 1:
    - The element is 100, which is even, so `even` is incremented to 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The element is 200, which is even, so `even` is incremented to 2.
The second loop iterates over the elements of `lst2`.
Iteration 1:
    - The element is 200, which is even, so `even` is incremented to 3.
Iteration 2:
    - The element is 200, which is even, so `even` is incremented to 4.
After both loops have finished, the value of `even` is 4 and the value of `odd` is 0.
The condition `even >= odd` is true, so the function returns "YES".
