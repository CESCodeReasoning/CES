[REASONING]
The function `exchange` is called with two lists: `lst1 = [100, 200]` and `lst2 = [200, 200]`.
Inside the function, two variables `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.
The first loop iterates over the elements of `lst1`.
Iteration 1:
    - The element is 100, which is even, so `even` is incremented to 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The element is 200, which is even, so `even` is incremented to 2.
The second loop iterates over the elements of `lst2`.
Iteration 1:
    - The element is 200, which is even, so `even` is incremented to 3.
Iteration 2:
    - The element is 200, which is even, so `even` is incremented to 4.
After both loops have finished, the value of `even` is 4 and the value of `odd` is 0.
The condition `even >= odd` is true, so the function returns "YES".

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    odd = 0
    even = 0
    for i in lst1: ## [STATE]i=[100, 200][/STATE][STATE]lst1=[100, 200][/STATE]
        if i % 2 == 1: ## [CONDITION](i % 2 == 1)=[False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N][/BRANCH]
            odd += 1
    for i in lst2: ## [STATE]i=[200, 200][/STATE][STATE]lst2=[200, 200][/STATE]
        if i % 2 == 0: ## [CONDITION](i % 2 == 0)=[True, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            even += 1
    if even >= odd: ## [CONDITION](even >= odd)=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return "YES"
    return "NO"
