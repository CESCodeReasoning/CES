The function `longest` is called with a list of strings: `['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc']`.

The function first checks if the list of strings is empty. Since it's not, the function proceeds to find the length of the longest string in the list.

The function uses a list comprehension to find the length of each string in the list and then uses the `max` function to find the maximum length. The maximum length is stored in the variable `maxlen`.

The function then iterates through the list of strings and checks if the length of the current string is equal to the maximum length. If it is, the function returns the current string.

The function iterates through the list of strings and finds that the string `'zzzz'` has the maximum length of 4. The function then returns the string `'zzzz'`.
