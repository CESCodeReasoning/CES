[REASONING]
The function compare takes two lists of integers, game and guess, as input and returns a list of the absolute differences between the corresponding elements in the two lists.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input [[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]], we need to compute the absolute difference between each corresponding element in the two lists.
Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input [[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]] is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

[ANSWER]
def compare(game, guess):
    return [abs(x - y) for x, y in zip(game, guess)]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[/OUTPUT]
