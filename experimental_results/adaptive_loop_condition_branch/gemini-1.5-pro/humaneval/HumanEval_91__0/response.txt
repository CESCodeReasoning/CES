[REASONING]
The function is_bored takes a string S as input and returns the number of sentences in S that start with the word "I".
To determine the number of sentences in S that start with the word "I", we need to split S into sentences using the regular expression r'[.?!]\s*'.
Then, we need to iterate over the sentences and check if the first two characters of each sentence are "I ".
If the first two characters of a sentence are "I ", then we increment the count of sentences that start with the word "I".
Finally, we return the count of sentences that start with the word "I".

[ANSWER]
def is_bored(S):
    import re
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)
    # [STATE]sentences = ['You and I are going for a walk'][/STATE]
    count = 0
    for sentence in sentences:
        # [CONDITION]sentence[0:2] == 'I '[/CONDITION]
        # [BRANCH]Y[/BRANCH]
        count += 1
    return count
