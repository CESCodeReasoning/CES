The function is_bored takes a string S as input and returns the number of sentences in S that start with the word "I".
To determine the number of sentences in S that start with the word "I", we need to split S into sentences using the regular expression r'[.?!]\s*'.
Then, we need to iterate over the sentences and check if the first two characters of each sentence are "I ".
If the first two characters of a sentence are "I ", then we increment the count of sentences that start with the word "I".
Finally, we return the count of sentences that start with the word "I".
