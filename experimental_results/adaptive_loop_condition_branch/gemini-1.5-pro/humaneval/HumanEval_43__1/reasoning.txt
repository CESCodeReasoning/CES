The function pairs_sum_to_zero(l) takes a list of numbers([-3, 9, -1, 3, 2, 31]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - l1= -3: compare with 9, -1, 3, 2, 31:
        - When j = 1 (l[j]=9), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=-1), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is True, the if branch is taken. Return True.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - No more elements to compare.
