[REASONING]
The function `count_nums` takes an array of integers as input and returns the count of numbers that have a positive sum of digits.

The function `digits_sum` takes an integer as input and returns the sum of its digits. If the input integer is negative, the function multiplies the sum by -1 to make it positive.

The function `count_nums` uses the `filter` function to filter out the numbers that have a non-positive sum of digits. The `filter` function takes a lambda function as input, which takes a number as input and returns True if the number is greater than 0, and False otherwise.

The `count_nums` function then returns the length of the list of numbers that have a positive sum of digits.

In this case, the input array is [1, 6, 9, -6, 0, 1, 5].

The `digits_sum` function is called on each number in the array.

For the number 1, the sum of digits is 1, which is positive.
For the number 6, the sum of digits is 6, which is positive.
For the number 9, the sum of digits is 9, which is positive.
For the number -6, the sum of digits is -6, which is negative.
For the number 0, the sum of digits is 0, which is non-positive.
For the number 1, the sum of digits is 1, which is positive.
For the number 5, the sum of digits is 5, which is positive.

The `filter` function filters out the numbers that have a non-positive sum of digits. In this case, the numbers -6 and 0 are filtered out.

The `count_nums` function returns the length of the list of numbers that have a positive sum of digits, which is 5.

Therefore, the output of the function `count_nums([1, 6, 9, -6, 0, 1, 5])` is 5.

from typing import *


def count_nums(arr):
    def digits_sum(n):
        neg = 1
        if n < 0: ## [CONDITION](n < 0)=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
            n, neg = -1 * n, -1
        n = [int(i) for i in str(n)]
        n[0] = n[0] * neg
        return sum(n)
    return len(list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, [digits_sum(i) for i in arr])))
