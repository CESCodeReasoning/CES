The function `how_many_times` is called with ( string = '', substring = 'x' ).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0.

The loop iterates from 0 to 0 (since ( len(string) - len(substring) + 1 ) = 0 ).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `string[i:i+len(substring)]` is '' (since i = 0 and len(substring) = 1).
   - '' is not equal to 'x', so the condition is false.
   - Action: `times` remains 0.
