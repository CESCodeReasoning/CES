The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'xywzx' ).
Inside the function, a loop iterates from 0 to the length of the text minus 1 (since the index of the last character is `len(text) - 1`).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - The character at index 0 is 'x', and the character at index 4 (the last index) is also 'x'.
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - The character at index 1 is 'y', and the character at index 3 is also 'y'.
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - The character at index 2 is 'w', and the character at index 2 is also 'w'.
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - The character at index 3 is 'z', and the character at index 1 is also 'z'.
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - The character at index 4 is 'x', and the character at index 0 is also 'x'.
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
Since the condition is false in all iterations, the function returns True.
