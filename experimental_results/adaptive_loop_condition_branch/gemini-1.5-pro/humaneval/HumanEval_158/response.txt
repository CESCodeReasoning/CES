[REASONING]
The function find_max takes a list of strings words as input and returns the string with the maximum number of unique characters.
To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "of", "string"], we need to first sort the list of strings by the number of unique characters in each string in descending order.
Then, we need to return the first string in the sorted list.
The number of unique characters in "name" is 4, the number of unique characters in "of" is 2, and the number of unique characters in "string" is 6.
Therefore, the sorted list of strings is ["string", "name", "of"].
The first string in the sorted list is "string".
Therefore, the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "of", "string"] is "string".
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def find_max(words):
    # [STATE]words = ["name", "of", "string"]
    # [STATE]sorted_words = ["string", "name", "of"]
    return sorted(words, key = lambda x: (-len(set(x)), x))[0]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
"string"
