The function `sort_even` is called with the list `[1, 2, 3]`.
The list is split into two lists: `evens` contains the even-indexed elements, and `odds` contains the odd-indexed elements.
The list `evens` is sorted in ascending order.
The list `ans` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates over the elements in `evens` and `odds` in parallel, and appends them to `ans` in that order.
After the loop completes, the condition `len(evens) > len(odds)` is checked.
Since `len(evens) = 1` and `len(odds) = 2`, the condition is `False`, so the `else` branch is taken.
The last element of `evens` is appended to `ans`.
The function returns `ans`.
