[REASONING]
The function add takes two integers x and y as input and returns the sum of x and y.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input 0 and 1, we need to evaluate the sum of 0 and 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input 0 and 1 is 1.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
