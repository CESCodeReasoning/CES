The function `is_multiply_prime` takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` can be expressed as a product of three prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.
The function first defines a helper function `is_prime` that checks if a given number is prime.
The function `is_multiply_prime` then iterates over all possible combinations of three prime numbers and checks if their product is equal to `a`.
If such a combination is found, the function returns `True`.
Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

In this case, we are checking if `3 * 6 * 7` can be expressed as a product of three prime numbers.
The first loop iterates over all prime numbers less than 101.
The second loop iterates over all prime numbers less than 101.
The third loop iterates over all prime numbers less than 101.
For each combination of three prime numbers, we check if their product is equal to `3 * 6 * 7`.
If such a combination is found, the function returns `True`.
Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

In this case, we find that `3 * 6 * 7` can be expressed as a product of three prime numbers (3, 6, and 7).
Therefore, the function returns `True`.
