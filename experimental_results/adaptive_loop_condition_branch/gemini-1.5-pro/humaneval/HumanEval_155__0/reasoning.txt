The function `even_odd_count` is called with ( num = -345821 ).
Inside the function, two variables `even_count` and `odd_count` are initialized to 0.
The function converts the absolute value of the input number to a string and iterates over each character in the string.
Iteration 1:
    -The character '3' is converted to an integer and checked for evenness. Since 3 is odd, `odd_count` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '4' is converted to an integer and checked for evenness. Since 4 is even, `even_count` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '5' is converted to an integer and checked for evenness. Since 5 is odd, `odd_count` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '8' is converted to an integer and checked for evenness. Since 8 is even, `even_count` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '2' is converted to an integer and checked for evenness. Since 2 is even, `even_count` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '1' is converted to an integer and checked for evenness. Since 1 is odd, `odd_count` is incremented by 1.
