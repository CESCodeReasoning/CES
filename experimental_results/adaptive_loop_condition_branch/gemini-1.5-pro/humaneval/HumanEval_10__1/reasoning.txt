The function `is_palindrome` is called with the string 'x'.
The function first checks if the string is empty. Since 'x' is not empty, the if branch is not taken.
The function then initializes the variable `beginning_of_suffix` to 0.
The while loop continues until the substring starting at `beginning_of_suffix` is a palindrome.
In the first iteration of the loop, `beginning_of_suffix` is 0 and `string[beginning_of_suffix:]` is 'x'. The function `is_palindrome` is called on 'x', which is a palindrome, so the while loop terminates.
The function then returns the string 'x' concatenated with the reverse of the substring starting at `beginning_of_suffix`, which is 'x'.
