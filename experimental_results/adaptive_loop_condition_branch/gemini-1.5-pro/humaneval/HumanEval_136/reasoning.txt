The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers lst as input and returns a tuple containing the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7], we need to first filter out the negative integers and the positive integers from the list.
The negative integers in the list are [-1, -3].
The positive integers in the list are [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7].
The largest negative integer in the list is -1.
The smallest positive integer in the list is 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7] is (-1, 1).
