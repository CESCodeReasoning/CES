The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list, which is 1.
The loop iterates over the list [1, 2, 3].
First Iteration (e = 2)
   - `e` is 2, which is greater than `m` (1).
   - The condition `e > m` is true.
   - Action: `m = e` updates `m` to 2.
Second Iteration (e = 3)
   - `e` is 3, which is greater than `m` (2).
   - The condition `e > m` is true.
   - Action: `m = e` updates `m` to 3.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `m`, which is now 3.
