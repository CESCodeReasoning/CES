[REASONING]
The function remove_vowels takes a string text as input and returns a new string with all the vowels removed.
To determine the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input 'ybcd', we need to iterate over each character in the string and check if it is a vowel.
If the character is a vowel, we skip it.
Otherwise, we add it to the new string.
Since 'ybcd' does not contain any vowels, the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input 'ybcd' is 'ybcd'.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def remove_vowels(text):
    return "".join([s for s in text if s.lower()
                   not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]])
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
'ybcd'
[/OUTPUT]
