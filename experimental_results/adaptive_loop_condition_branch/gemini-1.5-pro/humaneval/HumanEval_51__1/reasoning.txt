The function remove_vowels takes a string text as input and returns a new string with all the vowels removed.
To determine the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input 'ybcd', we need to iterate over each character in the string and check if it is a vowel.
If the character is a vowel, we skip it.
Otherwise, we add it to the new string.
Since 'ybcd' does not contain any vowels, the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input 'ybcd' is 'ybcd'.
