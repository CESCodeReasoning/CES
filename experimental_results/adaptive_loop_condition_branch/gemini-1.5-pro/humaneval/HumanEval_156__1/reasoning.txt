The function `int_to_mini_roman` is called with ( number = 152 ).
Inside the function, two lists `num` and `sym` are initialized with corresponding values.
The variable `i` is initialized to 12.
The variable `res` is initialized to an empty string.
First Iteration:
    - number = 152, num[i] = 1000, div = 152 // 1000 = 0, number = 152 % 1000 = 152.
    - The while loop is skipped because div is 0.
Second Iteration:
    - number = 152, num[i] = 900, div = 152 // 900 = 0, number = 152 % 900 = 152.
    - The while loop is skipped because div is 0.
Third Iteration:
    - number = 152, num[i] = 500, div = 152 // 500 = 0, number = 152 % 500 = 152.
    - The while loop is skipped because div is 0.
Fourth Iteration:
    - number = 152, num[i] = 400, div = 152 // 400 = 0, number = 152 % 400 = 152.
    - The while loop is skipped because div is 0.
Fifth Iteration:
    - number = 152, num[i] = 100, div = 152 // 100 = 1, number = 152 % 100 = 52.
    - The while loop iterates once and adds 'C' to `res`.
Sixth Iteration:
    - number = 52, num[i] = 90, div = 52 // 90 = 0, number = 52 % 90 = 52.
    - The while loop is skipped because div is 0.
Seventh Iteration:
    - number = 52, num[i] = 50, div = 52 // 50 = 1, number = 52 % 50 = 2.
    - The while loop iterates once and adds 'L' to `res`.
Eighth Iteration:
    - number = 2, num[i] = 40, div = 2 // 40 = 0, number = 2 % 40 = 2.
    - The while loop is skipped because div is 0.
Ninth Iteration:
    - number = 2, num[i] = 10, div = 2 // 10 = 0, number = 2 % 10 = 2.
    - The while loop is skipped because div is 0.
Tenth Iteration:
    - number = 2, num[i] = 9, div = 2 // 9 = 0, number = 2 % 9 = 2.
    - The while loop is skipped because div is 0.
Eleventh Iteration:
    - number = 2, num[i] = 5, div = 2 // 5 = 0, number = 2 % 5 = 2.
    - The while loop is skipped because div is 0.
Twelfth Iteration:
    - number = 2, num[i] = 4, div = 2 // 4 = 0, number = 2 % 4 = 2.
    - The while loop is skipped because div is 0.
Thirteenth Iteration:
    - number = 2, num[i] = 1, div = 2 // 1 = 2, number = 2 % 1 = 0.
    - The while loop iterates twice and adds 'II' to `res`.
The while loop terminates because number is 0.
The function returns the value of `res`, which is now 'CLI'.
