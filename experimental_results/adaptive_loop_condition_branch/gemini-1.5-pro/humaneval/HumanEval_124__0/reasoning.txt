The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '01-01-2007' ).
The date is split into three parts: month, day, and year.
The month is 1, the day is 1, and the year is 2007.
The first condition checks if the month is less than 1 or greater than 12.
The month is 1, which is not less than 1 and not greater than 12, so the condition is false.
The second condition checks if the month is in the list [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and the day is less than 1 or greater than 31.
The month is 1, which is in the list [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12], and the day is 1, which is not less than 1 and not greater than 31, so the condition is false.
The third condition checks if the month is in the list [4, 6, 9, 11] and the day is less than 1 or greater than 30.
The month is 1, which is not in the list [4, 6, 9, 11], so the condition is false.
The fourth condition checks if the month is 2 and the day is less than 1 or greater than 29.
The month is 1, which is not equal to 2, so the condition is false.
Since all the conditions are false, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('01-01-2007')` is True.
