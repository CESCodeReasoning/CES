[REASONING]
The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = '[[[[]]]]' ).
Inside the function, two lists `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` are initialized to store the indices of opening and closing brackets, respectively.

Iteration 1:
    - The character at index 0 is '[', which is an opening bracket. So, `opening_bracket_index` becomes [0].

Iteration 2:
    - The character at index 1 is '[', which is an opening bracket. So, `opening_bracket_index` becomes [0, 1].

Iteration 3:
    - The character at index 2 is '[', which is an opening bracket. So, `opening_bracket_index` becomes [0, 1, 2].

Iteration 4:
    - The character at index 3 is '[', which is an opening bracket. So, `opening_bracket_index` becomes [0, 1, 2, 3].

Iteration 5:
    - The character at index 4 is ']', which is a closing bracket. So, `closing_bracket_index` becomes [4].

Iteration 6:
    - The character at index 5 is ']', which is a closing bracket. So, `closing_bracket_index` becomes [4, 5].

Iteration 7:
    - The character at index 6 is ']', which is a closing bracket. So, `closing_bracket_index` becomes [4, 5, 6].

Iteration 8:
    - The character at index 7 is ']', which is a closing bracket. So, `closing_bracket_index` becomes [4, 5, 6, 7].

Now, `closing_bracket_index` is reversed to [7, 6, 5, 4].

Iteration 1:
    - The first opening bracket index is 0. The first closing bracket index is 7. Since 0 < 7, `cnt` is incremented to 1.

Iteration 2:
    - The second opening bracket index is 1. The second closing bracket index is 6. Since 1 < 6, `cnt` is incremented to 2.

Iteration 3:
    - The third opening bracket index is 2. The third closing bracket index is 5. Since 2 < 5, `cnt` is incremented to 3.

Iteration 4:
    - The fourth opening bracket index is 3. The fourth closing bracket index is 4. Since 3 is not less than 4, `cnt` is not incremented.

Therefore, `cnt` is 3, which is greater than or equal to 2. So, the function returns True.
