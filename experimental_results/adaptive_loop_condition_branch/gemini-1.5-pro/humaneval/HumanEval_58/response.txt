[REASONING]
The function common(l1: list, l2: list) takes two lists as its parameters.
It initializes an empty set ret to store the common elements between the two lists.
The outer loop iterates through each element e1 in the first list l1.
For each e1, the inner loop iterates through each element e2 in the second list l2.
If e1 is equal to e2, it means they are common elements, so e1 is added to the set ret.
Finally, the function returns a sorted list of the common elements.
First Iteration (e1=1):
    - e1 is 1, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - Compare 1 with 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121:
        - When e2 = 1, the condition `e1 == e2` is True, add 1 to ret.
Second Iteration (e1=4):
    - e1 is 4, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - Compare 4 with 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121:
        - No match, move on.
Third Iteration (e1=3):
    - e1 is 3, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - Compare 3 with 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121:
        - No match, move on.
Forth Iteration (e1=34):
    - e1 is 34, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - Compare 34 with 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121:
        - No match, move on.
Fifth Iteration (e1=653):
    - e1 is 653, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - Compare 653 with 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121:
        - When e2 = 653, the condition `e1 == e2` is True, add 653 to ret.
Sixth Iteration (e1=2):
    - e1 is 2, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - Compare 2 with 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121:
        - No match, move on.
Seventh Iteration (e1=5):
    - e1 is 5, e2 in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - Compare 5 with 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121:
        - When e2 = 5, the condition `e1 == e2` is True, add 5 to ret.

        for e2 in l2: ## [STATE]l2=[5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121][/STATE]
            if e1 == e2: ## [CONDITION](e1 == e2)=[True, False, False, False, True, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, N, N, N, Y, N, Y][/BRANCH]
                ret.add(e1)
    return sorted(list(ret))
