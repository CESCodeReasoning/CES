The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['1234567']).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to [].
The loop iterates over the elements of `lst`.
First Iteration (arr = '1234567'):
    `sum(int(d)%2==1 for d in arr)` calculates the number of odd digits in '1234567'.
    `int(d)%2==1` checks if the digit `d` is odd.
    `sum(int(d)%2==1 for d in arr)` results in 4 since there are 4 odd digits in '1234567'.
    `res.append("the number of odd elements " + str(n) + "n the str"+ str(n) +"ng "+ str(n) +" of the "+ str(n) +"nput.")` appends the string "the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput." to `res`.
