[REASONING]
The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string consisting of the numbers from 1 to n, separated by spaces.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3, we need to first generate the list of numbers from 1 to 3, which is [1, 2, 3].
Then, we need to convert each number in the list to a string, which gives us ['1', '2', '3'].
Finally, we need to join the strings in the list with spaces, which gives us the output '1 2 3'.

[ANSWER]
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    # Generate the list of numbers from 1 to n
    numbers = [x for x in range(1, n + 1)]  # [STATE]numbers = [1, 2, 3][/STATE]
    # Convert each number in the list to a string
    strings = [str(x) for x in numbers]  # [STATE]strings = ['1', '2', '3'][/STATE]
    # Join the strings in the list with spaces
    result = ' '.join(strings)  # [STATE]result = '1 2 3'[/STATE]
    return result
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
'1 2 3'
