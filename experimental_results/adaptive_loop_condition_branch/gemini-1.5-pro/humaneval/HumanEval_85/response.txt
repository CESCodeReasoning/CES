[REASONING]
The function add takes a list lst as input and returns the sum of all even elements in the list at odd indices.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88], we need to first identify the even elements in the list at odd indices.
The first element in the list is at index 0, which is an even index, so we skip it.
The second element in the list is at index 1, which is an odd index, and it is even, so we add it to the sum.
There are no more elements in the list, so the sum of all even elements in the list at odd indices is 88.
Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88] is 88.

[ANSWER]
def add(lst):
    return sum([lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if [CONDITION]lst[i]%2 == 0])
