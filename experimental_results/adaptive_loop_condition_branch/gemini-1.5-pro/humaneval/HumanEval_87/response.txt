[REASONING]
The function get_row takes a list of lists lst and an integer x as input, and returns a list of tuples representing the coordinates of all occurrences of x in lst.
The list comprehension [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst)) for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x] generates a list of tuples representing the coordinates of all occurrences of x in lst.
The function sorted sorts the list of tuples by the second element in each tuple in reverse order, and then by the first element in each tuple.
Therefore, the output of executing the function get_row on the input [], 1) is [].

[ANSWER]
def get_row(lst, x):
    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst)) for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
    # [STATE]coords = [][/STATE]
    # [CONDITION]len(lst) == 0[/CONDITION]
    # [BRANCH]N[/BRANCH]
    return sorted(sorted(coords, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True), key=lambda x: x[0])
