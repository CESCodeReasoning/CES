[REASONING]
The function max_fill takes a 2D grid and a capacity as input, and returns the minimum number of containers needed to fill the grid.
Each container can hold at most capacity amount of water.
To determine the minimum number of containers needed to fill the grid, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the grid and divide it by the capacity.
Since we can only use integer number of containers, we need to round up the result to the nearest integer.
Therefore, the minimum number of containers needed to fill the grid is the sum of the rounded up total amount of water in each row of the grid.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    return sum([math.ceil(sum(arr)/capacity) for arr in grid])
[/ANSWER]
