The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [1,2,3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    - `i` is 0, which is divisible by 3.
    - The condition `i %3 == 0` is true.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` appends `1**2 = 1` to `result`.

Iteration 2:
    - `i` is 1, which is not divisible by 3.
    - The condition `i %3 == 0` is false.
    - The condition `i % 4 == 0 and i%3 != 0` is also false.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i])` appends `2` to `result`.

Iteration 3:
    - `i` is 2, which is divisible by 3.
    - The condition `i %3 == 0` is true.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` appends `3**2 = 9` to `result`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the sum of the elements in `result`, which is `1 + 2 + 9 = 12`.
