[REASONING]
The function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter takes a string txt as input and returns True if the last character of the string is a letter, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter on the input "A", we need to first split the string into a list of words using the split() method.
The last word in the list of words is the last character of the string.
We then check if the length of the last word is 1 and if the ASCII code of the lowercase version of the last word is between 97 and 122.
If both conditions are met, then the last character of the string is a letter and the function returns True.
Otherwise, the function returns False.
In this case, the last character of the string "A" is a letter, so the function returns True.

[ANSWER]
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):

    check = txt.split(' ')[-1]
    return True if len(check) == 1 and (
        97 <= ord(check.lower()) <= 122) else False
