[REASONING]
The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Hello' ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is assigned the length of the string, which is 5.
The first condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is false because `l` is not 0 or 1.
The loop iterates from 2 to 5 (since `l` is 5).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `l` is not divisible by 2, so the condition `l % i == 0` is false.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `l` is not divisible by 3, so the condition `l % i == 0` is false.
Third Iteration (i = 4)
   - `l` is not divisible by 4, so the condition `l % i == 0` is false.
Since none of the iterations found a divisor for `l`, the function returns True.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def prime_length(string):
    l = len(string)
    if l == 0 or l == 1: ## [CONDITION](l == 0 or l == 1)=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](l == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][CONDITION](l == 1)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return False ## [STATE]i=??[/STATE]
    for i in range(2, l): ## [STATE]range(2, l)=[2, 3, 4][/STATE][STATE]l=[5][/STATE]
        if l % i == 0: ## [CONDITION](l % i == 0)=[False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            return False
    return True
