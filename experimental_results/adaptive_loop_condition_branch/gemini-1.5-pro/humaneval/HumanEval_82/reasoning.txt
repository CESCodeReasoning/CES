The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Hello' ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is assigned the length of the string, which is 5.
The first condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is false because `l` is not 0 or 1.
The loop iterates from 2 to 5 (since `l` is 5).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `l` is not divisible by 2, so the condition `l % i == 0` is false.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `l` is not divisible by 3, so the condition `l % i == 0` is false.
Third Iteration (i = 4)
   - `l` is not divisible by 4, so the condition `l % i == 0` is false.
Since none of the iterations found a divisor for `l`, the function returns True.
