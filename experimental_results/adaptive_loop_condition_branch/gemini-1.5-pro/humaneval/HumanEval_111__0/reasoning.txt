The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'a b c d g' ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `dict1` is initialized to an empty dictionary, and a list `list1` is created by splitting the input string `test` by spaces.
The variable `t` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The first element of `list1` is 'a'. `list1.count('a')` returns 1, which is greater than `t`. Also, 'a' is not an empty string. So, the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i != ''` is true.
    - The value of `t` is updated to 1.

Iteration 2:
    - The second element of `list1` is 'b'. `list1.count('b')` returns 1, which is not greater than `t`. So, the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i != ''` is false.

Iteration 3:
    - The third element of `list1` is 'c'. `list1.count('c')` returns 1, which is not greater than `t`. So, the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i != ''` is false.

Iteration 4:
    - The fourth element of `list1` is 'd'. `list1.count('d')` returns 1, which is not greater than `t`. So, the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i != ''` is false.

Iteration 5:
    - The fifth element of `list1` is 'g'. `list1.count('g')` returns 1, which is not greater than `t`. So, the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i != ''` is false.

Since `t` is greater than 0, the second for loop is executed.

Iteration 1:
    - The first element of `list1` is 'a'. `list1.count('a')` returns 1, which is equal to `t`. So, the condition `(list1.count(i) == t)` is true.
    - The key-value pair `('a', 1)` is added to `dict1`.

Iteration 2:
    - The second element of `list1` is 'b'. `list1.count('b')` returns 1, which is not equal to `t`. So, the condition `(list1.count(i) == t)` is false.

Iteration 3:
    - The third element of `list1` is 'c'. `list1.count('c')` returns 1, which is not equal to `t`. So, the condition `(list1.count(i) == t)` is false.

Iteration 4:
    - The fourth element of `list1` is 'd'. `list1.count('d')` returns 1, which is not equal to `t`. So, the condition `(list1.count(i) == t)` is false.

Iteration 5:
    - The fifth element of `list1` is 'g'. `list1.count('g')` returns 1, which is not equal to `t`. So, the condition `(list1.count(i) == t)` is false.

The function returns the dictionary `dict1`, which contains the key-value pair `('a', 1)`.
