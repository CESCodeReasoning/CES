The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "aAaaaXa" ).
The string `s` is not empty, so the if branch is not taken.
The function returns the sum of the ASCII values of the uppercase characters in the string.
The uppercase characters in the string are 'A' and 'X', so the function returns the sum of their ASCII values, which is 65 + 88 = 153.
