[REASONING]
The function filter_by_prefix takes a list of strings and a prefix as input, and returns a list of strings that start with the given prefix.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_prefix on the input [], 'john', we need to check if each string in the list starts with the prefix 'john'.
Since the input list is empty, the output list will also be empty.
Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_by_prefix on the input [], 'john' is [].
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if [CONDITION]x.startswith(prefix)[/CONDITION]]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[]
