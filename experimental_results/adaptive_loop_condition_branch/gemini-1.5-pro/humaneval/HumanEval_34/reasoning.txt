The function unique takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of the unique elements in l.
To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], we need to first find the set of unique elements in the list, which is {0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123}.
Then, we need to sort the set of unique elements, which gives us [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123].
Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123] is [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123].
