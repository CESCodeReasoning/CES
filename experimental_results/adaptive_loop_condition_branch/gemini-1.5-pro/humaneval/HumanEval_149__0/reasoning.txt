The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["d", "dcba", "abcd", "a"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order, resulting in `lst = ["a", "d", "abcd", "dcba"]`.
A new list `new_lst` is created.
The loop iterates through each element `i` in the sorted list `lst`.
First Iteration (i = "a"):
   - The length of "a" is 1, which is odd.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: "a" is not added to `new_lst`.
Second Iteration (i = "d"):
   - The length of "d" is 1, which is odd.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: "d" is not added to `new_lst`.
Third Iteration (i = "abcd"):
   - The length of "abcd" is 4, which is even.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: "abcd" is added to `new_lst`.
Fourth Iteration (i = "dcba"):
   - The length of "dcba" is 4, which is even.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: "dcba" is added to `new_lst`.
After the loop completes, the list `new_lst` contains ["abcd", "dcba"].
The list `new_lst` is sorted again, this time by the length of its elements, resulting in `new_lst = ["abcd", "dcba"]`.
The sorted list `new_lst` is returned.
