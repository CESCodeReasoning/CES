The function reverse_delete takes two strings as input, s and c.
It first creates a new string s by removing all the characters in c from s.
Then, it checks if the new string s is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards).
If it is, the function returns a tuple containing the new string s and True.
Otherwise, it returns a tuple containing the new string s and False.
To determine the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcde" and "ae", we need to first remove all the characters in "ae" from "abcde".
This gives us the new string "bcd".
Then, we need to check if "bcd" is a palindrome.
It is not, so the function returns a tuple containing the new string "bcd" and False.
