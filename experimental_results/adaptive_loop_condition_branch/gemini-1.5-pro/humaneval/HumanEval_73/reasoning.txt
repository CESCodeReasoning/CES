The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 to 3 (since ( len(arr) // 2 = 4 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `arr[i]` is 1 and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 6.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` results in `ans = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `arr[i]` is 2 and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 7.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` results in `ans = 2`.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `arr[i]` is 3 and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 9.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` results in `ans = 3`.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `arr[i]` is 5 and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 4.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` results in `ans = 4`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is now 4.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6])` is 4.
