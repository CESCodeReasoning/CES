[REASONING]
The function triangle_area takes two arguments, a and h, which represent the base and height of a triangle, respectively.
The function returns the area of the triangle, which is calculated as (base * height) / 2.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input 2 and 2, we need to substitute these values into the formula for the area of a triangle.
Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input 2 and 2 is 2.0.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return a * h / 2.0
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
2.0
[/OUTPUT]
