[REASONING]
The function is_bored takes a string S as input and returns the number of sentences in S that start with the word "I".
To determine the number of sentences in S that start with the word "I", we need to split S into sentences using the regular expression r'[.?!]\s*', and then count the number of sentences that start with the word "I".
To split S into sentences, we use the re.split function with the regular expression r'[.?!]\s*'. This regular expression matches any of the following characters: '.', '?', or '!'.
To count the number of sentences that start with the word "I", we use a list comprehension to iterate over the sentences and check if the first two characters of each sentence are 'I '.
Therefore, the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "Hello world" is 0.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def is_bored(S):
    import re
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)
    return sum(sentence[0:2] == 'I ' for sentence in sentences)
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
0
