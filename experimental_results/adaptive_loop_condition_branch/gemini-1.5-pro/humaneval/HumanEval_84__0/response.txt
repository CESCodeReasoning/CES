[REASONING]
The function solve takes an integer N as input and returns the binary representation of the sum of the digits of N.
To determine the output of executing the function solve on the input 963, we need to first calculate the sum of the digits of 963, which is 9 + 6 + 3 = 18.
Then, we need to convert 18 to binary, which is 10010.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solve on the input 963 is "10010".
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def solve(N):
    # [STATE] N = 963 [/STATE]
    return bin(sum(int(i) for i in str(N)))[2:]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
"10010"
[/OUTPUT]
