The function `digits` is called with ( n = 120 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1 and `odd_count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first digit of n is '1', which is not odd, so the `if` condition is not met.
Iteration 2:
    -The second digit of n is '2', which is not odd, so the `if` condition is not met.
Iteration 3:
    -The third digit of n is '0', which is not odd, so the `if` condition is not met.
Since no odd digits were encountered, the `if` condition in the end is met, and the function returns 0.
