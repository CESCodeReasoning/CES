[REASONING]
The function `digits` is called with ( n = 120 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1 and `odd_count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first digit of n is '1', which is not odd, so the `if` condition is not met.
Iteration 2:
    -The second digit of n is '2', which is not odd, so the `if` condition is not met.
Iteration 3:
    -The third digit of n is '0', which is not odd, so the `if` condition is not met.
Since no odd digits were encountered, the `if` condition in the end is met, and the function returns 0.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def digits(n):
    product = 1
    odd_count = 0
    for digit in str(n): ## [STATE]digit=['1', '2', '0'][/STATE][STATE]str(n)=['120'][/STATE][STATE]n=[120][/STATE]
        int_digit = int(digit)
        if int_digit % 2 == 1: ## [CONDITION](int_digit % 2 == 1)=[False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            product = product * int_digit
            odd_count += 1
    if odd_count == 0: ## [CONDITION](odd_count == 0)=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return 0
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return product
