The function `modp` is called with (n = 3, p = 11).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to 1.
`range(n)` = [0, 1, 2] since n = 3.
The loop iterates from 0 to 2.

First Iteration (i = 0):
    `ret = (2 * ret) % p` updates `ret` to 2 ( (2 * 1) % 11 = 2 ).
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    `ret = (2 * ret) % p` updates `ret` to 4 ( (2 * 2) % 11 = 4 ).
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    `ret = (2 * ret) % p` updates `ret` to 8 ( (2 * 4) % 11 = 8 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ret`, which is now 8.
