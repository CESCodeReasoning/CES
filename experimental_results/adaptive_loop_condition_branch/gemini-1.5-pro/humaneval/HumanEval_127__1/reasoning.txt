The function `intersection` is called with two intervals: `interval1 = [-1, 1]` and `interval2 = [0, 4]`.
The function first calculates the length of the intersection of the two intervals: `length = min(interval1[1], interval2[1]) - max(interval1[0], interval2[0])`.
In this case, the intersection is `[0, 1]`, so `length = 1`.
The function then checks if the length of the intersection is greater than 0 and if the length is a prime number.
In this case, the length is 1, which is not a prime number, so the function returns "NO".
