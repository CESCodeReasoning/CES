The function add_elements takes an array arr and an integer k as input and returns the sum of the elements in the first k positions of the array that have a length of 2 or less when converted to a string.
To determine the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9] and k=4, we need to first identify the elements in the first 4 positions of the array that have a length of 2 or less when converted to a string.
The elements in the first 4 positions of the array are 11, 21, 3, and 90.
Of these elements, only 11, 3, and 90 have a length of 2 or less when converted to a string.
Therefore, the sum of the elements in the first 4 positions of the array that have a length of 2 or less when converted to a string is 11 + 3 + 90 = 104.
Therefore, the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9] and k=4 is 104.
