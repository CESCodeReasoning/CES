The function `Strongest_Extension` is called with ( class_name = 'finNNalLLly', extensions = ['Die', 'NowW', 'Wow', 'WoW'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `strong` is initialized to the first element of `extensions` (which is 'Die').
A variable `my_val` is initialized to the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in `strong` (which is 1).
The loop iterates over the remaining elements of `extensions` (starting from the second element).
First Iteration (s = 'NowW'):
   - The difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in 'NowW' is 1.
   - This is not greater than `my_val`, so `strong` and `my_val` remain unchanged.
Second Iteration (s = 'Wow'):
   - The difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in 'Wow' is 1.
   - This is not greater than `my_val`, so `strong` and `my_val` remain unchanged.
Third Iteration (s = 'WoW'):
   - The difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in 'WoW' is 2.
   - This is greater than `my_val`, so `strong` is updated to 'WoW' and `my_val` is updated to 2.
After the loop completes, the function returns the concatenation of `class_name` and `strong` (which is 'finNNalLLly.WoW').
