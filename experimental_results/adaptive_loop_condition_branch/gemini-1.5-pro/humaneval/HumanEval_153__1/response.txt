[REASONING]
The function `Strongest_Extension` is called with ( class_name = 'finNNalLLly', extensions = ['Die', 'NowW', 'Wow', 'WoW'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `strong` is initialized to the first element of `extensions` (which is 'Die').
A variable `my_val` is initialized to the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in `strong` (which is 1).
The loop iterates over the remaining elements of `extensions` (starting from the second element).
First Iteration (s = 'NowW'):
   - The difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in 'NowW' is 1.
   - This is not greater than `my_val`, so `strong` and `my_val` remain unchanged.
Second Iteration (s = 'Wow'):
   - The difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in 'Wow' is 1.
   - This is not greater than `my_val`, so `strong` and `my_val` remain unchanged.
Third Iteration (s = 'WoW'):
   - The difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in 'WoW' is 2.
   - This is greater than `my_val`, so `strong` is updated to 'WoW' and `my_val` is updated to 2.
After the loop completes, the function returns the concatenation of `class_name` and `strong` (which is 'finNNalLLly.WoW').

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strong = extensions[0]
    my_val = len([x for x in extensions[0] if x.isalpha() and x.isupper()]) - \
        len([x for x in extensions[0] if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])
    for s in extensions: ## [STATE]s=['NowW', 'Wow', 'WoW'][/STATE][STATE]extensions=['Die', 'NowW', 'Wow', 'WoW'][/STATE]
        val = len([x for x in s if x.isalpha() and x.isupper()]) - \
            len([x for x in s if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])
        if val > my_val: ## [CONDITION](val > my_val)=[False, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            strong = s
            my_val = val

    ans = class_name + "." + strong
    return ans
