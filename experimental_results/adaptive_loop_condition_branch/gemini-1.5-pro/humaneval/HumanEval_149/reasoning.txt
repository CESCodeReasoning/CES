The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["aa", "a", "aaa"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order, resulting in `lst = ["a", "aa", "aaa"]`.
A new empty list `new_lst` is created.
The loop iterates over the sorted list `lst`.
First Iteration (i = "a")
   - The length of "a" is 1, which is odd.
   - The condition `len(i)%2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: "a" is not added to `new_lst`.
Second Iteration (i = "aa")
   - The length of "aa" is 2, which is even.
   - The condition `len(i)%2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: "aa" is added to `new_lst`.
Third Iteration (i = "aaa")
   - The length of "aaa" is 3, which is odd.
   - The condition `len(i)%2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: "aaa" is not added to `new_lst`.
After the loop completes, the list `new_lst` contains only "aa".
Finally, the list `new_lst` is sorted by length, resulting in `new_lst = ["aa"]`.
The function returns the sorted list `new_lst`.
