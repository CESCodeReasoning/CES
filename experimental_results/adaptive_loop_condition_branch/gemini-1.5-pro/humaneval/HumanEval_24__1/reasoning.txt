The function `largest_divisor` is called with ( n = 100 ).
Inside the function, a loop iterates through the values from ( n - 1 ) down to 1.
Iteration 1:
    - `i` is 99, and ( 100 % 99 != 0 ), so the condition is false.
Iteration 2:
    - `i` is 98, and ( 100 % 98 != 0 ), so the condition is false.
Iteration 3:
    - `i` is 97, and ( 100 % 97 != 0 ), so the condition is false.
Iteration 4:
    - `i` is 50, and ( 100 % 50 != 0 ), so the condition is false.
Iteration 5:
    - `i` is 25, and ( 100 % 25 != 0 ), so the condition is false.
Iteration 6:
    - `i` is 20, and ( 100 % 20 != 0 ), so the condition is false.
Iteration 7:
    - `i` is 10, and ( 100 % 10 != 0 ), so the condition is false.
Iteration 8:
    - `i` is 5, and ( 100 % 5 != 0 ), so the condition is false.
Iteration 9:
    - `i` is 4, and ( 100 % 4 != 0 ), so the condition is false.
Iteration 10:
    - `i` is 2, and ( 100 % 2 != 0 ), so the condition is false.
Iteration 11:
    - `i` is 1, and ( 100 % 1 == 0 ), so the condition is true.
