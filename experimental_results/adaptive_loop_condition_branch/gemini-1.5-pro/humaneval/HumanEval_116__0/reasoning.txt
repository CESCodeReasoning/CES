The function sort_array takes an array arr as input and returns a sorted array based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each element in the array.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [3,6,44,12,32,5], we need to first sort the array in ascending order.
The sorted array is [3,5,6,12,32,44].
Next, we need to sort the array based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each element.
The binary representation of 3 is 11, the binary representation of 5 is 101, the binary representation of 6 is 110, the binary representation of 12 is 1100, the binary representation of 32 is 100000, and the binary representation of 44 is 101100.
The number of 1s in the binary representation of 3 is 2, the number of 1s in the binary representation of 5 is 2, the number of 1s in the binary representation of 6 is 2, the number of 1s in the binary representation of 12 is 2, the number of 1s in the binary representation of 32 is 1, and the number of 1s in the binary representation of 44 is 2.
Therefore, the sorted array based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each element is [32,6,12,3,5,44].
