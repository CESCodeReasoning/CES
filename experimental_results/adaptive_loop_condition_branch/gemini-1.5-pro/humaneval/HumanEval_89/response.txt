[REASONING]
The function `encrypt` is called with ( s = 'hi' ).
Inside the function, a variable `out` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.
First Iteration (c = 'h')
   - `c` is in the string `d`, so the condition `c in d` is true.
   - The index of `c` in `d` is 7.
   - The expression `(d.index(c)+2*2) % 26` evaluates to 11.
   - The character at index 11 in `d` is 'l'.
   - The character 'l' is appended to `out`.
Second Iteration (c = 'i')
   - `c` is in the string `d`, so the condition `c in d` is true.
   - The index of `c` in `d` is 8.
   - The expression `(d.index(c)+2*2) % 26` evaluates to 12.
   - The character at index 12 in `d` is 'm'.
   - The character 'm' is appended to `out`.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def encrypt(s):
    d = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    out = '' ## [STATE]out=[][/STATE]
    for c in s: ## [STATE]s=['h', 'i'][/STATE]
        if c in d: ## [CONDITION](c in d)=[True, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            out += d[(d.index(c)+2*2) % 26]
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N, N][/BRANCH]
            out += c
    return out
