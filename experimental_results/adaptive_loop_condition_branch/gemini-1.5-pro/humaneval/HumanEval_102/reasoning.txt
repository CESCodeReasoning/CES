The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 12, y = 15 ).
The first condition `x > y` is false, so the if branch is not taken.
The second condition `y % 2 == 0` is false, so the if branch is not taken.
The third condition `x == y` is false, so the if branch is not taken.
Therefore, the function returns `y - 1`, which is 15 - 1 = 14.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(12, 15)` is 14.
