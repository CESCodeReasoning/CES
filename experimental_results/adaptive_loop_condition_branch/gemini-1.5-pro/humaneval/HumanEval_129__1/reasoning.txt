The function `minPath` is called with ( grid = [[8, 14, 9, 2], [6, 4, 13, 15], [5, 7, 1, 12], [3, 10, 11, 16]], k = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the grid, which is 4.
The function then initializes a variable `val` to a large value ( n * n + 1 = 17 ).
The function then iterates through each cell in the grid using two nested loops.
For each cell, the function checks if the value of the cell is 1.
If the value of the cell is 1, the function creates a temporary list `temp` and adds the values of the cells to the north, south, east, and west of the current cell to the list.
The function then finds the minimum value in the temporary list and assigns it to the variable `val`.
After iterating through all the cells in the grid, the function initializes a list `ans` and iterates through the range of k (which is 5).
For each iteration, the function checks if the iteration number is even.
If the iteration number is even, the function appends 1 to the list `ans`.
Otherwise, the function appends the value of `val` to the list `ans`.
Finally, the function returns the list `ans`.
