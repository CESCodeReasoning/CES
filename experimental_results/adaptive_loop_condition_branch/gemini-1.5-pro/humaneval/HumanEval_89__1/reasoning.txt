The function `encrypt` is called with ( s = 'asdfghjkl' ).
Inside the function, a variable `out` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.
First Iteration (c = 'a')
   - `c` is in the string `d`, so the condition `c in d` is true.
   - The index of `c` in `d` is 0.
   - The expression `(d.index(c) + 2 * 2) % 26` evaluates to 4.
   - The character at index 4 in `d` is 'e'.
   - The character 'e' is appended to `out`.
Second Iteration (c = 's')
   - `c` is in the string `d`, so the condition `c in d` is true.
   - The index of `c` in `d` is 18.
   - The expression `(d.index(c) + 2 * 2) % 26` evaluates to 22.
   - The character at index 22 in `d` is 'w'.
   - The character 'w' is appended to `out`.
Third Iteration (c = 'd')
   - `c` is in the string `d`, so the condition `c in d` is true.
   - The index of `c` in `d` is 3.
   - The expression `(d.index(c) + 2 * 2) % 26` evaluates to 9.
   - The character at index 9 in `d` is 'j'.
   - The character 'j' is appended to `out`.
Fourth Iteration (c = 'f')
   - `c` is in the string `d`, so the condition `c in d` is true.
   - The index of `c` in `d` is 5.
   - The expression `(d.index(c) + 2 * 2) % 26` evaluates to 11.
   - The character at index 11 in `d` is 'l'.
   - The character 'l' is appended to `out`.
Fifth Iteration (c = 'g')
   - `c` is in the string `d`, so the condition `c in d` is true.
   - The index of `c` in `d` is 6.
   - The expression `(d.index(c) + 2 * 2) % 26` evaluates to 13.
   - The character at index 13 in `d` is 'n'.
   - The character 'n' is appended to `out`.
Sixth Iteration (c = 'h')
   - `c` is in the string `d`, so the condition `c in d` is true.
   - The index of `c` in `d` is 7.
   - The expression `(d.index(c) + 2 * 2) % 26` evaluates to 15.
   - The character at index 15 in `d` is 'p'.
   - The character 'p' is appended to `out`.
Seventh Iteration (c = 'j')
   - `c` is in the string `d`, so the condition `c in d` is true.
   - The index of `c` in `d` is 9.
   - The expression `(d.index(c) + 2 * 2) % 26` evaluates to 19.
   - The character at index 19 in `d` is 't'.
   - The character 't' is appended to `out`.
Eighth Iteration (c = 'k')
   - `c` is in the string `d`, so the condition `c in d` is true.
   - The index of `c` in `d` is 10.
   - The expression `(d.index(c) + 2 * 2) % 26` evaluates to 21.
   - The character at index 21 in `d` is 'v'.
   - The character 'v' is appended to `out`.
Ninth Iteration (c = 'l')
   - `c` is in the string `d`, so the condition `c in d` is true.
   - The index of `c` in `d` is 11.
   - The expression `(d.index(c) + 2 * 2) % 26` evaluates to 23.
   - The character at index 23 in `d` is 'x'.
   - The character 'x' is appended to `out`.
