[REASONING]
The function `factorize` is called with ( n = 2 ).
Inside the function, a list `fact` is initialized to store the factors of `n`.
The loop iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (since the factors of `n` must be less than or equal to its square root).
First Iteration ( i = 2 ):
    - `n % i == 0` is true since 2 is a factor of 2. The first branch is taken.
    - `fact.append(i)` appends 2 to `fact`.
    - `n //= i` updates `n` to 1 ( 2 // 2 = 1 ).
Second Iteration ( i = 2 ):
    - `n % i == 0` is false since 2 is not a factor of 1. The first branch is not taken.
    - `i += 1` updates `i` to 3.
The loop terminates since `i` is now greater than the square root of `n`.
Since `n` is still greater than 1, the else branch is taken. `fact.append(n)` appends 1 to `fact`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `fact`, which is now [2, 1].

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    import math
    fact = []
    i = 2
    while i <= int(math.sqrt(n) + 1): ## [STATE]i=[2, 2][/STATE][STATE]int((math.sqrt(n) + 1))=[2, 2][/STATE]
        if n % i == 0: ## [CONDITION](n % i == 0)=[True, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, N][/BRANCH]
            fact.append(i)
            n //= i
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
            i += 1

    if n > 1: ## [CONDITION](n > 1)=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        fact.append(n)
    return fact
