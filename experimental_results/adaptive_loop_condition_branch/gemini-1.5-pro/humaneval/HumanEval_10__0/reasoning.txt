The function `is_palindrome` is called with the string 'xyx'.
The function first checks if the string is empty, which it is not, so the if branch is not taken.
The function then initializes the variable `beginning_of_suffix` to 0.
The while loop iterates until the substring starting at `beginning_of_suffix` is a palindrome.
First Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 0):
    - The substring string[beginning_of_suffix:] is 'xyx'.
    - The function `is_palindrome` is called on the substring 'xyx', which is not a palindrome, so the while loop continues.
Second Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 1):
    - The substring string[beginning_of_suffix:] is 'yx'.
    - The function `is_palindrome` is called on the substring 'yx', which is not a palindrome, so the while loop continues.
Third Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 2):
    - The substring string[beginning_of_suffix:] is 'x'.
    - The function `is_palindrome` is called on the substring 'x', which is a palindrome, so the while loop terminates.
The function then returns the string 'xyx' concatenated with the reverse of the substring 'x', which is 'xyx'.
