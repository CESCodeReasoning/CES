The function `is_happy` is called with ( s = "xyy" ).
The length of the string is 3, which is greater than or equal to 3.
The loop iterates from 0 to 0 (since ( len(s) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1 )).
Iteration 1 ( i = 0 )
   - `s[i]` is 'x', `s[i + 1]` is 'y', and `s[i + 2]` is 'y'.
   - The condition `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 2 ( i = 1 )
   - `s[i]` is 'y', `s[i + 1]` is 'y', and `s[i + 2]` is 'y'.
   - The condition `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]` is true.
   - Action: The function returns False.
