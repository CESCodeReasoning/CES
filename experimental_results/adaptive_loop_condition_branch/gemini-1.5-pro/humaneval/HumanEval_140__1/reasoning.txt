The function `fix_spaces` is called with ( text = "Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow" ).
Inside the function, a variable `new_text` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates through the characters in the text.
First Iteration ( i = 0 ):
    - The character at index 0 is 'Y'.
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
