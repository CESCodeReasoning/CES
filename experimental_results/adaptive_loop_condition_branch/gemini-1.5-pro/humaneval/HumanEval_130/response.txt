[REASONING]
The function `tri` is called with ( n = 3 ).
The function first checks if ( n == 0 ), which is not the case here, so it proceeds to the next step.
It initializes a list `my_tri` with the first two elements [1, 3].
The loop iterates from 2 to ( n + 1 ), which is from 2 to 4.
First Iteration ( i = 2 )
   - `i` is even ( 2 % 2 == 0 ), so the condition is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` appends 2 to `my_tri`, resulting in `[1, 3, 2]`.
Second Iteration ( i = 3 )
   - `i` is odd ( 3 % 2 == 0 ), so the condition is false.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` appends 9 to `my_tri`, resulting in `[1, 3, 2, 9]`.
Third Iteration ( i = 4 )
   - `i` is even ( 4 % 2 == 0 ), so the condition is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` appends 3 to `my_tri`, resulting in `[1, 3, 2, 9, 3]`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `my_tri`, which is `[1, 3, 2, 9, 3]`.

from typing import *
def tri(n):
    if n == 0: ## [CONDITION](n == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return [1]
    my_tri = [1, 3] ## [STATE]i=[1, 3][/STATE]
    for i in range(2, (n + 1)): ## [STATE]range(2, (n + 1))=[2, 3, 4][/STATE][STATE](n + 1)=[4][/STATE]
        if i % 2 == 0: ## [CONDITION](i % 2 == 0)=[True, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, N][/BRANCH]
            my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N, Y][/BRANCH]
            my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)
    return my_tri
