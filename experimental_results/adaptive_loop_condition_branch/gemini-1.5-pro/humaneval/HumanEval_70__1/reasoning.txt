The function `strange_sort_list` is called with ( lst = [111111] ).
Inside the function, two variables `res` and `switch` are initialized to [] and True, respectively.
First Iteration:
    - lst = [111111], min(lst) = 111111, switch = True.
    -`res.append(min(lst) if switch else max(lst))` appends 111111 to `res`.
    -`lst.remove(res[-1])` removes 111111 from `lst`.
    -`switch = not switch` updates `switch` to False.
The while loop terminates because `lst` is empty. The function returns the value of `res`, which is now [111111].
