[REASONING]
The function `prod_signs` is called with ( arr = [1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1] ).
First, the function checks if the array is empty. Since the array is not empty, the function proceeds to calculate the product of the signs of the negative numbers in the array and the sum of the absolute values of all the numbers in the array.
The function first checks if there is a 0 in the array. Since there is no 0 in the array, the function proceeds to calculate the product of the signs of the negative numbers in the array.
The function uses the `filter` function to create a list of all the negative numbers in the array. The `filter` function takes a lambda function as its first argument. The lambda function takes a single argument, `x`, and returns `True` if `x` is less than 0, and `False` otherwise.
The `filter` function returns a list of all the negative numbers in the array. The `len` function is then used to calculate the length of the list of negative numbers.
The function then calculates the product of the signs of the negative numbers in the array by raising (-1) to the power of the length of the list of negative numbers.
The function then calculates the sum of the absolute values of all the numbers in the array. The `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute value of each number in the array. The `sum` function is then used to calculate the sum of the absolute values of all the numbers in the array.
The function then returns the product of the signs of the negative numbers in the array and the sum of the absolute values of all the numbers in the array.

Therefore, the final output of the function `prod_signs([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1])` is 12.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def prod_signs(arr):
    if not arr: ## [CONDITION](not arr)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return None
    prod = 0 if 0 in arr else (-1) ** len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr)))
    return prod * sum([abs(i) for i in arr])
[/ANSWER]
