[REASONING]
The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "<<><>>" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over each character in the string.
First Iteration (b = "<"):
   - The character is "<", so the depth is incremented to 1.
Second Iteration (b = "<"):
   - The character is "<", so the depth is incremented to 2.
Third Iteration (b = ">"):
   - The character is ">", so the depth is decremented to 1.
Fourth Iteration (b = ">"):
   - The character is ">", so the depth is decremented to 0.
Fifth Iteration (b = ">"):
   - The character is ">", so the depth is decremented to -1.
   - The condition `depth < 0` is true, so the function returns False.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets: ## [STATE]brackets=["<<><>>"][/STATE]
        if b == "<": ## [CONDITION](b == "<")=[True, True, False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y, N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            depth += 1
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N, N, Y, Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0: ## [CONDITION](depth < 0)=[False, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            return False
    return depth == 0
