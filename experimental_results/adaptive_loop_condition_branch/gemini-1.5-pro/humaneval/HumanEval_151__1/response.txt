[REASONING]
The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the odd numbers in the list that are not floating-point numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [], we need to first check if the list is empty.
Since the list is empty, the sum of the squares of the odd numbers in the list is 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [] is 0.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def double_the_difference(lst):
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i %
               2 != 0 and "." not in str(i)])
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
0
