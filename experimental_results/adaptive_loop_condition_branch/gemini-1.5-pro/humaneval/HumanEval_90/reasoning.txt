The function next_smallest takes a list of integers lst as input and returns the second smallest integer in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we need to first sort the list and remove any duplicate elements.
The sorted and deduplicated list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Since the length of the list is greater than or equal to 2, we return the second element of the list, which is 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 2.
