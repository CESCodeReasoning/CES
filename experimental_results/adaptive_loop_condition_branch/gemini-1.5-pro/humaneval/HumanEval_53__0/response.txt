[REASONING]
The function add takes two integers x and y as input and returns the sum of x and y.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input 7 and 5, we need to evaluate the sum of 7 and 5.
Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input 7 and 5 is 12.
[/REASONING]
