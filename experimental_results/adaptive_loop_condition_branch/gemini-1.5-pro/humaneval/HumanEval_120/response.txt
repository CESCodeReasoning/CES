[REASONING]
The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3 ).
The condition `k == 0` is false, so the if branch is not taken.
The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order, resulting in `[-4, -3, 5]`.
The last `k` elements of the sorted array are taken, resulting in `[-3, 5]`.
This list is returned as the result of the function.

Therefore, the final output of the function `maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3)` is `[-3, 5]`.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def maximum(arr, k):
    if k == 0: ## [CONDITION](k == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return []
    arr.sort()
    ans = arr[-k:]
    return ans
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[-3, 5]
