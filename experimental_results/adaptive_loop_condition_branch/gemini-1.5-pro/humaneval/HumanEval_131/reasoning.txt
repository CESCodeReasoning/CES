The function `digits` is called with ( n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1 and `odd_count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the digits of the string representation of n (which is "5" in this case).
First Iteration (digit = "5")
   - The integer value of the digit is 5, which is odd ( 5 % 2 == 1 ).
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product` is updated to 5 (`1 * 5 = 5`) and `odd_count` is updated to 1 (`0 + 1 = 1`).
Since `odd_count` is not 0, the function returns the value of `product`, which is 5.
