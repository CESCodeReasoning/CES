[REASONING]
The function `Strongest_Extension` is called with ( class_name = 'Sp', extensions = ['671235', 'Bb'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `strong` is initialized to the first element of `extensions`, which is '671235'.
The variable `my_val` is initialized to the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in `strong`, which is 0.
The loop iterates over the remaining elements of `extensions`, which is ['Bb'].
For each element `s` in `extensions`, the variable `val` is initialized to the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in `s`, which is 1.
The condition `val > my_val` is evaluated to True, since 1 is greater than 0.
As a result, the variable `strong` is updated to `s`, which is 'Bb', and the variable `my_val` is updated to 1.
After the loop completes, the variable `ans` is constructed by concatenating the class name, a period, and the strongest extension, which is 'Bb'.
The function returns the value of `ans`, which is 'Sp.Bb'.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strong = extensions[0]
    my_val = len([x for x in extensions[0] if x.isalpha() and x.isupper()]) - \
        len([x for x in extensions[0] if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])
    for s in extensions: ## [STATE]s=['Bb'][/STATE][STATE]extensions=['671235', 'Bb'][/STATE]
        val = len([x for x in s if x.isalpha() and x.isupper()]) - \
            len([x for x in s if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])
        if val > my_val: ## [CONDITION](val > my_val)=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
            strong = s
            my_val = val

    ans = class_name + "." + strong
    return ans
