The function `change_base` is called with ( x = 8, base = 3 ).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to an empty string.
First Iteration:
    - x = 8, x % base = 2, ret = "2" + "" = "2".
Second Iteration:
    - x = 2, x % base = 2, ret = "2" + "2" = "22".
Third Iteration:
    - x = 0, x % base = 0, ret = "0" + "22" = "022".
x is 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `ret`, which is now "022".
