The function filter_by_substring takes a list of strings and a substring as input, and returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that contain the substring.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input [], 'john', we need to check if the substring 'john' is contained in each string in the input list.
Since the input list is empty, the output list will also be empty.
