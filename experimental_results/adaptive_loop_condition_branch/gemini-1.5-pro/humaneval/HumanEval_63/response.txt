[REASONING]
The function `fibfib` is called with ( n = 2 ).
The first condition ( n == 0 ) is false, so the first branch is not taken.
The second condition ( n == 1 ) is false, so the second branch is not taken.
The third condition ( n == 2 ) is true, so the third branch is taken and the function returns 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fibfib(2)` is 1.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def fibfib(n: int):
    if n == 0: ## [CONDITION](n == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return 0
    if n == 1: ## [CONDITION](n == 1)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return 0
    if n == 2: ## [CONDITION](n == 2)=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return 1
    return fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)
