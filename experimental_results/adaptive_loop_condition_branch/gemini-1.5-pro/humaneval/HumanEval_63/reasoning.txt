The function `fibfib` is called with ( n = 2 ).
The first condition ( n == 0 ) is false, so the first branch is not taken.
The second condition ( n == 1 ) is false, so the second branch is not taken.
The third condition ( n == 2 ) is true, so the third branch is taken and the function returns 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fibfib(2)` is 1.
