[REASONING]
The function derivative takes a list of numbers xs as input and returns a list of numbers representing the derivative of xs.
The derivative of a list of numbers is a new list of numbers where each element is the product of the index of the element in the original list and the value of the element in the original list.
To determine the output of executing the function derivative on the input [1], we need to first create a list of numbers where each element is the product of the index of the element in the original list and the value of the element in the original list.
This list is [0].
Then, we need to remove the first element of this list, which gives us the output [].

[ANSWER]
def derivative(xs: list):
    return [(i * x) for i, x in enumerate(xs)][1:]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[]
