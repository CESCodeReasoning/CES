The function triangle_area takes two arguments, a and h, which represent the base and height of a triangle, respectively.
The function returns the area of the triangle, which is calculated as (base * height) / 2.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input 5 and 3, we need to evaluate the expression (5 * 3) / 2.0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input 5 and 3 is 7.5.
