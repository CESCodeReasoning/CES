The function `compare_one` is called with ( a = 1, b = 2 ).
Since both `a` and `b` are not strings, the first two if statements are skipped.
The third if statement compares the float values of `a` and `b`.
Since `float(1)` is equal to `float(2)`, the third if statement is true and the function returns `None`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one(1, 2)` is `None`.
