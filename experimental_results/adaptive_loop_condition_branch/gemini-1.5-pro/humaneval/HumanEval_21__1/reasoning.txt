The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of floats as input and returns a new list of floats where each element is rescaled to the unit interval [0, 1].
To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0], we need to first find the minimum and maximum values in the input list.
The minimum value is 1.0 and the maximum value is 5.0.
Then, we need to subtract the minimum value from each element in the input list and divide the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
Therefore, the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0] is [0.2, 0.0, 1.0, 0.6, 0.8].
