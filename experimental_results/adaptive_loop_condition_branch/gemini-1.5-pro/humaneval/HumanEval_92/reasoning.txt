The function `any_int` is called with ( x = 2, y = 3, z = 1 ).
The first condition checks if all three arguments are integers, which is true.
The second condition checks if any two of the three arguments add up to the third argument.
(2 + 3 == 1) is False, (2 + 1 == 3) is False, and (3 + 1 == 2) is True.
Therefore, the second condition is True.
The function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `any_int(2, 3, 1)` is True.
