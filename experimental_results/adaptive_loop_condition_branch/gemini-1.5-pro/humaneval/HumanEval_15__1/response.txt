[REASONING]
The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string consisting of the numbers from 1 to n, separated by spaces.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 10, we need to first generate the list of numbers from 1 to 10, which is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
Then, we need to convert each number in the list to a string, which gives us ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10'].
Finally, we need to join the strings in the list with spaces, which gives us the output string '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10'.

[ANSWER]
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    # Generate the list of numbers from 1 to n
    numbers = [x for x in range(1, n + 1)]  # [STATE]numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10][/STATE]
    # Convert each number in the list to a string
    strings = [str(x) for x in numbers]  # [STATE]strings = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10'][/STATE]
    # Join the strings in the list with spaces
    result = ' '.join(strings)  # [STATE]result = '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10'[/STATE]
    return result
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
'1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10'
