The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string consisting of the numbers from 1 to n, separated by spaces.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 10, we need to first generate the list of numbers from 1 to 10, which is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
Then, we need to convert each number in the list to a string, which gives us ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10'].
Finally, we need to join the strings in the list with spaces, which gives us the output string '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10'.
