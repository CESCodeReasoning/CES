[REASONING]
The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [135, 103, 31] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `odd_digit_elements` is initialized.
The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `x`.
First Iteration (i = 135)
   - The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is checked.
   - The condition checks if all the digits in the string representation of `i` are odd.
   - In this case, `i` is 135, and the digits are '1', '3', and '5', which are all odd.
   - The condition is true, so `i` is appended to the `odd_digit_elements` list.
Second Iteration (i = 103)
   - The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is checked again.
   - This time, `i` is 103, and the digits are '1', '0', and '3'.
   - The digit '0' is even, so the condition is false, and `i` is not appended to the `odd_digit_elements` list.
Third Iteration (i = 31)
   - The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is checked one last time.
   - `i` is 31, and the digits are '3' and '1', which are both odd.
   - The condition is true, so `i` is appended to the `odd_digit_elements` list.
After the loop completes, the `odd_digit_elements` list contains [135, 31].
The list is then sorted, resulting in the final output [31, 135].

from typing import *


def unique_digits(x):
    odd_digit_elements = []
    for i in x: ## [STATE]i=[135, 103, 31][/STATE][STATE]x=[135, 103, 31][/STATE]
        if all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i)): ## [CONDITION](all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i)))=[True, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            odd_digit_elements.append(i)
    return sorted(odd_digit_elements)
