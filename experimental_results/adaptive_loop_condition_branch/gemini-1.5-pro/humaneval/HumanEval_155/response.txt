[REASONING]
The function `even_odd_count` is called with ( num = 7 ).
Inside the function, two variables `even_count` and `odd_count` are initialized to 0.
The function then converts the absolute value of the input number to a string and iterates over each character in the string.
For each character, it converts it back to an integer and checks if it is even or odd.
If the integer is even, it increments the `even_count` by 1.
If the integer is odd, it increments the `odd_count` by 1.
After iterating over all the characters in the string, the function returns a tuple containing the `even_count` and the `odd_count`.

In this case, the input number is 7, so the absolute value is also 7.
The string representation of 7 is "7", so the function iterates over the single character "7".
The integer value of "7" is 7, which is odd, so the `odd_count` is incremented to 1.
The function then returns the tuple (0, 1), indicating that there are 0 even digits and 1 odd digit in the input number.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def even_odd_count(num):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0 ## [STATE]i=0[/STATE]
    for i in str(abs(num)): ## [STATE]str(abs(num))="7"[/STATE][STATE]abs(num)=7[/STATE]
        if int(i)%2==0: ## [CONDITION](int(i)%2==0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
            even_count +=1
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
            odd_count +=1
    return (even_count, odd_count)
