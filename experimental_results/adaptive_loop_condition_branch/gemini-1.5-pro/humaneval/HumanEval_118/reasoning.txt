The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "yogurt" ).
The length of the word is 6, which is greater than 3, so the first condition is false.
The function initializes a set of vowels.
The loop iterates from index 4 to 1 (inclusive) in reverse order.
Iteration 1:
    - The character at index 4 is 'r', which is not in vowels.
Iteration 2:
    - The character at index 3 is 't', which is not in vowels.
Iteration 3:
    - The character at index 2 is 'u', which is in vowels.
    - The character at index 1 is 'o', which is also in vowels.
    - The character at index 3 is 't', which is not in vowels.
    - The condition `(word[i+1] not in vowels) and (word[i-1] not in vowels)` is true.
    - The function returns 'u'.
