The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the elements of `nums`, which is an empty list.
Since the list is empty, the loop does not execute any iterations.
Therefore, the value of `count` remains 0.
