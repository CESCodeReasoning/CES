[REASONING]
The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the elements of `nums`, which is an empty list.
Since the list is empty, the loop does not execute any iterations.
Therefore, the value of `count` remains 0.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def specialFilter(nums):

    count = 0
    for num in nums: ## [STATE]nums=[][/STATE]
        if num > 10:
            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
            number_as_string = str(num)
            if int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(
                    number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits:
                count += 1

    return count
