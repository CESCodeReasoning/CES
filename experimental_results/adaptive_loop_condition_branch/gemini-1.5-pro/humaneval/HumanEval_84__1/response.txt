[REASONING]
The function solve takes an integer N as input and returns the binary representation of the sum of the digits of N.
To determine the output of executing the function solve on the input 147, we need to first convert 147 to a string, which is "147".
Then, we need to iterate over the characters in the string "147" and convert each character to an integer.
The sum of the integers is 1 + 4 + 7 = 12.
Finally, we need to convert 12 to binary, which is 1100.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solve on the input 147 is "1100".

[ANSWER]
def solve(N):
    # Convert N to a string
    N_str = str(N)
    # Initialize the sum of the digits to 0
    sum_digits = 0
    # Iterate over the characters in the string
    for i in N_str:
        # Convert the character to an integer
        digit = int(i)
        # Add the digit to the sum of the digits
        sum_digits += digit
    # Convert the sum of the digits to binary
    binary_sum = bin(sum_digits)[2:]
    # Return the binary representation of the sum of the digits
    return binary_sum
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
"1100"
