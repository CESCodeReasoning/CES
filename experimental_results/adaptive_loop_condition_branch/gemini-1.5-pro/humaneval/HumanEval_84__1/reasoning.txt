The function solve takes an integer N as input and returns the binary representation of the sum of the digits of N.
To determine the output of executing the function solve on the input 147, we need to first convert 147 to a string, which is "147".
Then, we need to iterate over the characters in the string "147" and convert each character to an integer.
The sum of the integers is 1 + 4 + 7 = 12.
Finally, we need to convert 12 to binary, which is 1100.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solve on the input 147 is "1100".
