The function iscube takes an integer a as input and returns True if a is a perfect cube, and False otherwise.
To determine if a is a perfect cube, the function first takes the absolute value of a and stores it in a.
Then, the function rounds a to the nearest integer and raises it to the power of 1/3.
The result is then rounded to the nearest integer and cubed.
If the result is equal to a, then a is a perfect cube and the function returns True.
Otherwise, the function returns False.
In this case, a is 2.
The absolute value of 2 is 2.
The rounded value of 2 to the nearest integer is 2.
The rounded value of 2 raised to the power of 1/3 is 1.
The cubed value of 1 is 1.
Since 1 is not equal to 2, the function returns False.
