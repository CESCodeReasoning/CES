The function `string_xor` takes two binary strings `a` and `b` as input and returns a new binary string that is the result of XORing the two input strings.
The function `xor` is a helper function that takes two characters `i` and `j` as input and returns '0' if the characters are the same, and '1' otherwise.
The function `string_xor` uses the `zip` function to iterate over the characters in the two input strings, and then calls the `xor` function on each pair of characters.
The results of the `xor` function calls are then joined together to form the output string.

For example, if `a` is '111000' and `b` is '101010', then the output of the `string_xor` function will be '010010'.
