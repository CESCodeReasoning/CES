[REASONING]
The function `can_arrange` is called with the list `arr = [4,8,5,7,3]`.
The variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The variable `i` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 1 to 5 (since `len(arr) = 5`).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    - `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false when `i = 1` because `arr[1] = 8` and `arr[0] = 4`.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true when `i = 2` because `arr[2] = 5` and `arr[1] = 8`.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true. The branch is taken.
    - `ind` is updated to 2.
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false when `i = 3` because `arr[3] = 7` and `arr[2] = 5`.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    - `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false when `i = 4` because `arr[4] = 3` and `arr[3] = 7`.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The branch is not taken.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is 2.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def can_arrange(arr):
    ind = -1
    i = 1
    while i < len(arr): ## [STATE](i < len(arr))=[True, True, True, True][/STATE][STATE]i=[1, 2, 3, 4][/STATE][STATE]len(arr)=[5, 5, 5, 5][/STATE]
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]: ## [CONDITION](arr[i] < arr[i - 1])=[False, True, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, Y, N, N][/BRANCH]
            ind = i
        i += 1
    return ind
