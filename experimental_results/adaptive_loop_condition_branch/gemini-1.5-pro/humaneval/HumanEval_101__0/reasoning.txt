The function `words_string` is called with ( s = "One, two, three, four, five, six" ).
The function first checks if the input string `s` is empty. Since `s` is not empty, the function proceeds to convert the string into a list of words.

Iteration 1:
   - The first letter in `s` is 'O', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 2:
   - The second letter in `s` is 'n', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 3:
   - The third letter in `s` is 'e', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 4:
   - The fourth letter in `s` is ',', which is a comma, so a space is appended to `s_list` instead.

Iteration 5:
   - The fifth letter in `s` is ' ', which is a space, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 6:
   - The sixth letter in `s` is 't', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 7:
   - The seventh letter in `s` is 'w', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 8:
   - The eighth letter in `s` is 'o', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 9:
   - The ninth letter in `s` is ',', which is a comma, so a space is appended to `s_list` instead.

Iteration 10:
   - The tenth letter in `s` is ' ', which is a space, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 11:
   - The eleventh letter in `s` is 't', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 12:
   - The twelfth letter in `s` is 'h', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 13:
   - The thirteenth letter in `s` is 'r', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 14:
   - The fourteenth letter in `s` is 'e', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 15:
   - The fifteenth letter in `s` is 'e', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 16:
   - The sixteenth letter in `s` is ',', which is a comma, so a space is appended to `s_list` instead.

Iteration 17:
   - The seventeenth letter in `s` is ' ', which is a space, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 18:
   - The eighteenth letter in `s` is 'f', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 19:
   - The nineteenth letter in `s` is 'o', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 20:
   - The twentieth letter in `s` is 'u', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 21:
   - The twenty-first letter in `s` is 'r', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 22:
   - The twenty-second letter in `s` is ',', which is a comma, so a space is appended to `s_list` instead.

Iteration 23:
   - The twenty-third letter in `s` is ' ', which is a space, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 24:
   - The twenty-fourth letter in `s` is 'f', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 25:
   - The twenty-fifth letter in `s` is 'i', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 26:
   - The twenty-sixth letter in `s` is 'v', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 27:
   - The twenty-seventh letter in `s` is 'e', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 28:
   - The twenty-eighth letter in `s` is ',', which is a comma, so a space is appended to `s_list` instead.

Iteration 29:
   - The twenty-ninth letter in `s` is ' ', which is a space, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 30:
   - The thirtieth letter in `s` is 's', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 31:
   - The thirty-first letter in `s` is 'i', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

Iteration 32:
   - The thirty-second letter in `s` is 'x', which is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

After the loop, `s_list` contains ['O', 'n', 'e', ' ', 't', 'w', 'o', ' ', 't', 'h', 'r', 'e', 'e', ' ', 'f', 'o', 'u', 'r', ' ', 'f', 'i', 'v', 'e', ' ', 's', 'i', 'x'].

The function then joins the elements of `s_list` into a single string, resulting in 'One two three four five six'.

Finally, the function splits the string into a list of words, resulting in ['One', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six'].
