The function has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) takes a list of float numbers and a threshold as its parameters.
It iterates through each element in the list and compares it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
If the absolute difference between two elements is less than the threshold, the function returns True.
First Iteration (idx=0, elem=1.0):
    - Compare with 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2:
        - abs(1.0 - 2.0) = 1.0, not less than 0.3, skip.
        - abs(1.0 - 3.9) = 2.9, not less than 0.3, skip.
        - abs(1.0 - 4.0) = 3.0, not less than 0.3, skip.
        - abs(1.0 - 5.0) = 4.0, not less than 0.3, skip.
        - abs(1.0 - 2.2) = 1.2, not less than 0.3, skip.
Second Iteration (idx=1, elem=2.0):
    - Compare with 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2:
        - abs(2.0 - 3.9) = 1.9, not less than 0.3, skip.
        - abs(2.0 - 4.0) = 2.0, not less than 0.3, skip.
        - abs(2.0 - 5.0) = 3.0, not less than 0.3, skip.
        - abs(2.0 - 2.2) = 0.2, less than 0.3, return True.
