The function `intersection` is called with two intervals: `interval1 = (1, 2)` and `interval2 = (2, 3)`.
The function first calculates the length of the intersection of the two intervals: `length = min(interval1[1], interval2[1]) - max(interval1[0], interval2[0])`.
In this case, the intersection is the interval `(2, 2)`, so `length = 2 - 2 = 0`.
The function then checks if the length of the intersection is greater than 0 and if the length is prime.
In this case, the length is 0, which is not prime, so the function returns "NO".
