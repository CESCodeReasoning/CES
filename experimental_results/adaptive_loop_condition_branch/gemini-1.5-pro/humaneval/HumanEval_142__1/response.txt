[REASONING]
The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [-16, -9, -2, 36, 36, 26, -20, 25, -40, 20, -4, 12, -26, 35, 37] ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    - `i` is 0, which is divisible by 3.
    - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` appends (-16)**2 = 256 to `result`.

Iteration 2:
    - `i` is 1, which is not divisible by 3.
    - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is false.
    - The condition `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` is also false.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i])` appends -9 to `result`.

Iteration 3:
    - `i` is 2, which is not divisible by 3 or 4.
    - Both conditions `i % 3 == 0` and `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` are false.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i])` appends -2 to `result`.

Iteration 4:
    - `i` is 3, which is divisible by 3.
    - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` appends (36)**2 = 1296 to `result`.

Iteration 5:
    - `i` is 4, which is divisible by 4 but not by 3.
    - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is false.
    - The condition `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` is true.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**3)` appends (36)**3 = 46656 to `result`.

Iteration 6:
    - `i` is 5, which is not divisible by 3 or 4.
    - Both conditions `i % 3 == 0` and `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` are false.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i])` appends 26 to `result`.

Iteration 7:
    - `i` is 6, which is divisible by 3.
    - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` appends (-20)**2 = 400 to `result`.

Iteration 8:
    - `i` is 7, which is not divisible by 3 or 4.
    - Both conditions `i % 3 == 0` and `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` are false.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i])` appends 25 to `result`.

Iteration 9:
    - `i` is 8, which is divisible by 4 but not by 3.
    - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is false.
    - The condition `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` is true.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**3)` appends (-40)**3 = -64000 to `result`.

Iteration 10:
    - `i` is 9, which is not divisible by 3 or 4.
    - Both conditions `i % 3 == 0` and `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` are false.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i])` appends 20 to `result`.

Iteration 11:
    - `i` is 10, which is divisible by 3.
    - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` appends (-4)**2 = 16 to `result`.

Iteration 12:
    - `i` is 11, which is not divisible by 3 or 4.
    - Both conditions `i % 3 == 0` and `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` are false.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i])` appends 12 to `result`.

Iteration 13:
    - `i` is 12, which is divisible by 3.
    - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` appends (-26)**2 = 676 to `result`.

Iteration 14:
    - `i` is 13, which is not divisible by 3 or 4.
    - Both conditions `i % 3 == 0` and `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` are false.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i])` appends 35 to `result`.

Iteration 15:
    - `i` is 14, which is not divisible by 3 or 4.
    - Both conditions `i % 3 == 0` and `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` are false.
    - Action: `result.append(lst[i])` appends 37 to `result`.

Return Statement:
    - After the loop completes, the function returns the sum of the elements in `result`, which is 256 - 9 - 2 + 1296 + 46656 + 26 + 400 + 25 - 64000 + 20 + 16 + 12 + 676 + 35 + 37 = -2290.
