The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the elements of `nums`.
First Iteration ( num = 1 )
   - `num` is 1, which is not greater than 10.
   - The condition `num > 10` is false.
   - Action: The `if` block is skipped.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `count`, which is still 0.
