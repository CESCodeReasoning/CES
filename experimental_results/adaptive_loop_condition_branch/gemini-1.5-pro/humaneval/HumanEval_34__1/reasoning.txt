The function unique takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of the unique elements in l.
To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1], we need to first find the unique elements in the list, which are 1 and 2.
Then, we need to sort the list of unique elements, which gives us [1, 2].
Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1] is [1, 2].
