[REASONING]
The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [0, 10, 20, 1000000] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` is initialized to 0 and `s` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first number in nums is 0, so `s` becomes 0.
    -`s` is not less than 0, so `s` remains 0 and `max_sum` remains 0.

Iteration 2:
    -The second number in nums is 10, so `s` becomes -10.
    -`s` is less than 0, so `s` is reset to 0 and `max_sum` remains 0.

Iteration 3:
    -The third number in nums is 20, so `s` becomes -20.
    -`s` is less than 0, so `s` is reset to 0 and `max_sum` remains 0.

Iteration 4:
    -The fourth number in nums is 1000000, so `s` becomes -1000020.
    -`s` is less than 0, so `s` is reset to 0 and `max_sum` remains 0.

After the loop completes, `max_sum` is still 0.
Since `max_sum` is 0, the function calculates the minimum sum of all negative numbers in nums.
In this case, the only negative number in nums is 0, so the minimum sum is -0, which is 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([0, 10, 20, 1000000])` is 0.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def minSubArraySum(nums):
    max_sum = 0
    s = 0
    for num in nums: ## [STATE]num=[0, 10, 20, 1000000][/STATE][STATE]nums=[0, 10, 20, 1000000][/STATE]
        s += -num
        if (s < 0): ## [CONDITION](s < 0)=[True, True, True, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y, Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            s = 0
        max_sum = max(s, max_sum)
    if max_sum == 0: ## [CONDITION](max_sum == 0)=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        max_sum = max(-i for i in nums)
    min_sum = -max_sum
    return min_sum
