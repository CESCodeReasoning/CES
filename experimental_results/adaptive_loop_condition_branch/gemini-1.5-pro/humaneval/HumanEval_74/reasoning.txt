The function `total_match` is called with ( lst1 = ['hi', 'admin'], lst2 = ['hi', 'hi'] ).
Inside the function, two variables `l1` and `l2` are initialized to 0.
The first loop iterates over the elements of `lst1` and adds the length of each element to `l1`.
First Iteration (st = 'hi'):
    `l1 += len(st)` updates `l1` to 2 ( 0 + 2 = 2 ).
Second Iteration (st = 'admin'):
    `l1 += len(st)` updates `l1` to 6 ( 2 + 4 = 6 ).
The second loop iterates over the elements of `lst2` and adds the length of each element to `l2`.
First Iteration (st = 'hi'):
    `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 2 ( 0 + 2 = 2 ).
Second Iteration (st = 'hi'):
    `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 4 ( 2 + 2 = 4 ).
After the loops complete, the condition ( l1 <= l2 ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `lst1` as the output.
