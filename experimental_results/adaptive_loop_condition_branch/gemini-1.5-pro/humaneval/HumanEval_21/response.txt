[REASONING]
The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of floats as input and returns a new list of floats where each element is rescaled to the range [0, 1].
To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9], we need to first find the minimum and maximum values in the input list.
The minimum value in the input list is 2.0 and the maximum value is 49.9.
Next, we need to calculate the difference between each element in the input list and the minimum value, and then divide the result by the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value.
Therefore, the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9] is [0.0, 1.0].

[ANSWER]
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    min_number = min(numbers)  # [STATE]min_number = 2.0[/STATE]
    max_number = max(numbers)  # [STATE]max_number = 49.9[/STATE]
    return [(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number) for x in numbers]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[0.0, 1.0]
