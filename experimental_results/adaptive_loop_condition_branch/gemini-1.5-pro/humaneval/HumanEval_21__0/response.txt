[REASONING]
The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of floats as input and returns a list of floats where each element is rescaled to the unit interval [0, 1].
To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], we need to first find the minimum and maximum values in the input list.
The minimum value in the input list is 1.0 and the maximum value in the input list is 5.0.
Next, we need to compute the rescaled value for each element in the input list.
The rescaled value for an element x is computed as (x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number).
Therefore, the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] is [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0].

[ANSWER]
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    min_number = min(numbers)  # [STATE]min_number = 1.0[/STATE]
    max_number = max(numbers)  # [STATE]max_number = 5.0[/STATE]
    return [(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number) for x in numbers]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
