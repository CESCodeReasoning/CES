The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = '[[]]' ).
Inside the function, two lists `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` are initialized to store the indices of opening and closing brackets, respectively.

Iteration 1:
    - The character at index 0 is '[', which is an opening bracket. So, `opening_bracket_index` becomes [0].
Iteration 2:
    - The character at index 1 is '[', which is also an opening bracket. So, `opening_bracket_index` becomes [0, 1].
Iteration 3:
    - The character at index 2 is ']', which is a closing bracket. So, `closing_bracket_index` becomes [2].
Iteration 4:
    - The character at index 3 is ']', which is also a closing bracket. So, `closing_bracket_index` becomes [2, 3].

Now, `closing_bracket_index` is reversed, so it becomes [3, 2].

Iteration 1:
    - The first opening bracket index is 0.
    - The first closing bracket index is 3.
    - Since 0 < 2 and 0 < 3, the condition is true. So, `cnt` becomes 1.
    - `i` becomes 1.

Iteration 2:
    - The second opening bracket index is 1.
    - The second closing bracket index is 2.
    - Since 1 < 2 and 1 < 2, the condition is true. So, `cnt` becomes 2.
    - `i` becomes 2.

Since `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, the function returns True.
