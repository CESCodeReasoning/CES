[REASONING]
The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = '[[]]' ).
Inside the function, two lists `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` are initialized to store the indices of opening and closing brackets, respectively.

Iteration 1:
    - The character at index 0 is '[', which is an opening bracket. So, `opening_bracket_index` becomes [0].
Iteration 2:
    - The character at index 1 is '[', which is also an opening bracket. So, `opening_bracket_index` becomes [0, 1].
Iteration 3:
    - The character at index 2 is ']', which is a closing bracket. So, `closing_bracket_index` becomes [2].
Iteration 4:
    - The character at index 3 is ']', which is also a closing bracket. So, `closing_bracket_index` becomes [2, 3].

Now, `closing_bracket_index` is reversed, so it becomes [3, 2].

Iteration 1:
    - The first opening bracket index is 0.
    - The first closing bracket index is 3.
    - Since 0 < 2 and 0 < 3, the condition is true. So, `cnt` becomes 1.
    - `i` becomes 1.

Iteration 2:
    - The second opening bracket index is 1.
    - The second closing bracket index is 2.
    - Since 1 < 2 and 1 < 2, the condition is true. So, `cnt` becomes 2.
    - `i` becomes 2.

Since `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, the function returns True.

    closing_bracket_index = [] ## [STATE]i=[0, 1, 2, 3][/STATE]
    for i in range(len(string)): ## [STATE]range(len(string))=[0, 1, 2, 3][/STATE][STATE]len(string)=[4][/STATE]
        if string[i] == '[': ## [CONDITION](string[i] == '[')=[True, True, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y, N, N][/BRANCH]
            opening_bracket_index.append(i)
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N, N, Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            closing_bracket_index.append(i)
    closing_bracket_index.reverse()
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    l = len(closing_bracket_index) ## [STATE]idx=[2, 3][/STATE]
    for idx in opening_bracket_index: ## [STATE]opening_bracket_index=[0, 1][/STATE]
        if i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i]: ## [CONDITION](i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i])=[True, True][/CONDITION][CONDITION](i < l)=[True, True][/CONDITION][CONDITION](idx < closing_bracket_index[i])=[True, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            cnt += 1
            i += 1
    return cnt >= 2
