The function make_a_pile takes an integer n as input and returns a list of n integers, where the i-th integer in the list is n + 2 * i.
To determine the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 6, we need to evaluate the list comprehension [n + 2 * i for i in range(n)].
The range(n) generates a list of integers from 0 to n-1, which is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
For each integer i in the list, we evaluate the expression n + 2 * i.
For example, when i is 0, we evaluate n + 2 * i as 6 + 2 * 0, which is 6.
When i is 1, we evaluate n + 2 * i as 6 + 2 * 1, which is 8.
When i is 2, we evaluate n + 2 * i as 6 + 2 * 2, which is 10.
When i is 3, we evaluate n + 2 * i as 6 + 2 * 3, which is 12.
When i is 4, we evaluate n + 2 * i as 6 + 2 * 4, which is 14.
When i is 5, we evaluate n + 2 * i as 6 + 2 * 5, which is 16.
Therefore, the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 6 is the list [6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16].
