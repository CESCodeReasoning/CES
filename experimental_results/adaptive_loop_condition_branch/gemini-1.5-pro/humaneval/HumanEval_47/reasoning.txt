The function `median` is called with the list `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`.
The list is sorted in ascending order, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
The length of the sorted list is 5, which is odd.
The condition `len(l) % 2 == 1` is true, therefore the if branch is taken.
The middle index of the sorted list is `len(l) // 2`, which is 2.
The median is the element at index 2, which is 3.
Therefore, the final output of the function `median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])` is 3.
