The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 to 3 (since ( len(arr) // 2 ) = 3 ).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `arr[i]` is 1, and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 2, which are not equal.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` results in `ans = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `arr[i]` is 2, and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 2, which are equal.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains 1.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `arr[i]` is 3, and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 3, which are equal.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains 1.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2])` is 1.
