[REASONING]
The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string consisting of the numbers from 1 to n, separated by spaces.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 0, we need to first generate the list of numbers from 1 to 0, which is an empty list.
Then, we need to join the elements of the empty list with spaces, which results in an empty string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 0 is an empty string.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join([str(x) for x in range(n + 1)])
