[REASONING]
The function flip_case takes a string as input and returns a new string with the case of each character flipped.
To determine the output of executing the function flip_case on the input 'These violent delights have violent ends', we need to flip the case of each character in the input string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function flip_case on the input 'These violent delights have violent ends' is 'tHESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS HAVE VIOLENT ENDS'.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return string.swapcase()
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
'tHESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS HAVE VIOLENT ENDS'
[/OUTPUT]
