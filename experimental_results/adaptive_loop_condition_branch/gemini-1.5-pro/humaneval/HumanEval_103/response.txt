[REASONING]
The function `rounded_avg` is called with ( n = 1, m = 5 ).
The condition ( m < n ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The variable `summation` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( n = 1 ) and ( m = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 3 ( 1 + 2 = 3 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 6 ( 3 + 3 = 6 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 10 ( 6 + 4 = 10 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 15 ( 10 + 5 = 15 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns `bin(round(summation/(m - n + 1)))`, which is `bin(round(15/(5 - 1 + 1)))` = `bin(round(15/5))` = `bin(round(3))` = `bin(3)` = `0b11`.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if m < n: ## [CONDITION](m < n)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return -1
    summation = 0 ## [STATE]i=[0][/STATE]
    for i in range(n, (m + 1)): ## [STATE]range(n, (m + 1))=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5][/STATE][STATE]n=[1][/STATE][STATE](m + 1)=[6][/STATE]
        summation += i
    return bin(round(summation/(m - n + 1)))
