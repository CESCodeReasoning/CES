[REASONING]
The function get_positive takes a list l as input and returns a new list containing only the positive elements of l.
To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2], we need to first iterate over the elements of l and check if each element is greater than 0.
Since neither -1 nor -2 is greater than 0, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2] is an empty list.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def get_positive(l: list):
    return [e for e in l if [CONDITION]e > 0[/CONDITION]]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[]
