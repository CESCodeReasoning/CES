The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "1/5", n = "5/1" ).
The function splits the input strings into numerator and denominator.
The numerator of the first fraction is 1 and the denominator is 5.
The numerator of the second fraction is 5 and the denominator is 1.
The function multiplies the numerators and denominators of the two fractions to get the numerator and denominator of the simplified fraction.
The numerator of the simplified fraction is 1 * 5 = 5.
The denominator of the simplified fraction is 5 * 1 = 5.
The function checks if the simplified fraction is an integer by checking if the numerator is divisible by the denominator without a remainder.
The numerator is divisible by the denominator, so the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("1/5", "5/1")` is True.
