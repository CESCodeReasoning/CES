The function find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]) takes a list of float numbers as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by idx in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (idx=0, elem=1.0):
    - Compare with 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2:
        - When idx2 = 1 (elem2=2.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Since `distance` is None, the if branch of the inner if statement is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 1.0 and 2.0, which is 1.0.
            - Update `closest_pair` to be (1.0, 2.0).
        - When idx2 = 2 (elem2=3.9), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 1.0 and 3.9, which is 2.9.
            - Since the new distance is greater than the current distance, the else branch of the inner if statement is taken.
        - When idx2 = 3 (elem2=4.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 1.0 and 4.0, which is 3.0.
            - Since the new distance is greater than the current distance, the else branch of the inner if statement is taken.
        - When idx2 = 4 (elem2=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 1.0 and 5.0, which is 4.0.
            - Since the new distance is greater than the current distance, the else branch of the inner if statement is taken.
        - When idx2 = 5 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 1.0 and 2.2, which is 1.2.
            - Since the new distance is less than the current distance, the if branch of the inner if statement is taken.
            - Update `closest_pair` to be (1.0, 2.2).

    - Compare with 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2:

            - Calculate the distance between 2.0 and 3.9, which is 1.9.
            - Since the new distance is less than the current distance, the if branch of the inner if statement is taken.
            - Update `closest_pair` to be (2.0, 3.9).
        - When idx2 = 3 (elem2=4.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 2.0 and 4.0, which is 2.0.
            - Since the new distance is greater than the current distance, the else branch of the inner if statement is taken.
        - When idx2 = 4 (elem2=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 2.0 and 5.0, which is 3.0.
            - Since the new distance is greater than the current distance, the else branch of the inner if statement is taken.
        - When idx2 = 5 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 2.0 and 2.2, which is 0.2.
            - Since the new distance is less than the current distance, the if branch of the inner if statement is taken.
            - Update `closest_pair` to be (2.0, 2.2).
Third Iteration (idx=2, elem=3.9):
    - Compare with 4.0, 5.0, 2.2:
        - When idx2 = 3 (elem2=4.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 3.9 and 4.0, which is 0.1.
            - Since the new distance is less than the current distance, the if branch of the inner if statement is taken.
            - Update `closest_pair` to be (3.9, 4.0).
        - When idx2 = 4 (elem2=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 3.9 and 5.0, which is 1.1.
            - Since the new distance is greater than the current distance, the else branch of the inner if statement is taken.
        - When idx2 = 5 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance between 3.9 and 2.2, which is 1.7.
            - Since the new distance is greater than the current distance, the else branch of the inner if statement is taken.

            - Calculate the distance between 4.0 and 5.0, which is 1.0.
            - Since the new distance is greater than the current distance, the else branch of the inner if statement is taken.
