The function `starts_one_ends` is called with ( n = 2 ).
The condition `n == 1` is false, so the else branch is taken.
The else branch returns `18 * (10 ** (n - 2))`, which evaluates to `18 * (10 ** (2 - 2)) = 18 * (10 ** 0) = 18`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `starts_one_ends(2)` is 18.
