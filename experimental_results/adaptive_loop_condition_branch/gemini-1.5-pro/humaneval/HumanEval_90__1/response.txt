[REASONING]
The function next_smallest takes a list lst as input and returns the second smallest element in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [], we need to first sort the list and remove any duplicates.
Since the input list is empty, the sorted and deduplicated list will also be empty.
Since the length of the empty list is less than 2, the function will return None.
Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [] is None.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst = sorted(set(lst))
    return None if len(lst) < 2 else lst[1]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
None
