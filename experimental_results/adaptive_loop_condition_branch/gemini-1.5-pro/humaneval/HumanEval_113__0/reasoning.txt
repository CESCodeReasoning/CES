The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['3',"11111111"]).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to [].
The loop iterates over the elements of `lst`.
First Iteration (arr = '3'):
    `sum(int(d) % 2 == 1 for d in arr)` = 1 since there is one odd digit in '3'.
    `res.append("the number of odd elements " + str(n) + "n the str" + str(n) + "ng " + str(n) + " of the " + str(n) + "nput.")` results in `res = ["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput."]`.
Second Iteration (arr = "11111111"):
    `sum(int(d) % 2 == 1 for d in arr)` = 0 since there are no odd digits in "11111111".
    `res.append("the number of odd elements " + str(n) + "n the str" + str(n) + "ng " + str(n) + " of the " + str(n) + "nput.")` results in `res = ["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.", "the number of odd elements 0n the str0ng 0 of the 0nput."]`.
