The function `count_upper` is called with ( s = 'dBBE' ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 to the length of the string ( 4 ) with a step of 2.
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `s[i]` is 'd', which is not in "AEIOU".
   - The condition `s[i] in "AEIOU"` is false.
   - Action: `count` remains 0.
Second Iteration (i = 2)
   - `s[i]` is 'B', which is not in "AEIOU".
   - The condition `s[i] in "AEIOU"` is false.
   - Action: `count` remains 0.
