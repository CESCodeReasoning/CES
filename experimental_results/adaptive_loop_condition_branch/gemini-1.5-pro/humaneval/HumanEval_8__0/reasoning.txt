The function `sum_product` is called with an empty list `[]`.
Inside the function, two variables `sum_value` and `prod_value` are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
The loop iterates over the empty list `[]`.
Since the list is empty, the loop body is not executed.
After the loop completes, the function returns the tuple `(sum_value, prod_value)`, which is `(0, 1)`.
