[REASONING]
The function `prime_fib` is called with ( n = 4 ).
Inside the function, a list `f` is initialized with the first two Fibonacci numbers ( 0 and 1 ).
The function `is_prime` is defined to check if a number is prime.
The loop continues to generate Fibonacci numbers until `n` prime Fibonacci numbers are found.
First Iteration:
    - The next Fibonacci number is 1 ( 0 + 1 ).
    - The function `is_prime` is called with ( p = 1 ).
    - The condition `p < 2` is true.
    - The function `is_prime` returns False.
    - The Fibonacci number 1 is not prime.
Second Iteration:
    - The next Fibonacci number is 1 ( 1 + 0 ).
    - The function `is_prime` is called with ( p = 1 ).
    - The condition `p < 2` is true.
    - The function `is_prime` returns False.
    - The Fibonacci number 1 is not prime.
Third Iteration:
    - The next Fibonacci number is 2 ( 1 + 1 ).
    - The function `is_prime` is called with ( p = 2 ).
    - The condition `p < 2` is false.
    - The loop iterates from 2 to 1 (since ( min(int(math.sqrt(2)) + 1, 2 - 1) = 1 )).
    - The condition `p % k == 0` is false for all values of `k`.
    - The function `is_prime` returns True.
    - The Fibonacci number 2 is prime.
    - The value of `n` is decremented to 3.
Fourth Iteration:
    - The next Fibonacci number is 3 ( 2 + 1 ).
    - The function `is_prime` is called with ( p = 3 ).
    - The condition `p < 2` is false.
    - The loop iterates from 2 to 2 (since ( min(int(math.sqrt(3)) + 1, 3 - 1) = 2 )).
    - The condition `p % k == 0` is false for all values of `k`.
    - The function `is_prime` returns True.
    - The Fibonacci number 3 is prime.
    - The value of `n` is decremented to 2.
Fifth Iteration:
    - The next Fibonacci number is 5 ( 3 + 2 ).
    - The function `is_prime` is called with ( p = 5 ).
    - The condition `p < 2` is false.
    - The loop iterates from 2 to 2 (since ( min(int(math.sqrt(5)) + 1, 5 - 1) = 2 )).
    - The condition `p % k == 0` is false for all values of `k`.
    - The function `is_prime` returns True.
    - The Fibonacci number 5 is prime.
    - The value of `n` is decremented to 1.
Sixth Iteration:
    - The next Fibonacci number is 8 ( 5 + 3 ).
    - The function `is_prime` is called with ( p = 8 ).
    - The condition `p < 2` is false.
    - The loop iterates from 2 to 2 (since ( min(int(math.sqrt(8)) + 1, 8 - 1) = 2 )).
    - The condition `p % k == 0` is false for all values of `k`.
    - The function `is_prime` returns True.
    - The Fibonacci number 8 is prime.
    - The value of `n` is decremented to 0.
Seventh Iteration:
    - The next Fibonacci number is 13 ( 8 + 5 ).
    - The function `is_prime` is called with ( p = 13 ).
    - The condition `p < 2` is false.
    - The loop iterates from 2 to 3 (since ( min(int(math.sqrt(13)) + 1, 13 - 1) = 3 )).
    - The condition `p % k == 0` is false for all values of `k`.
    - The function `is_prime` returns True.
    - The Fibonacci number 13 is prime.
    - The value of `n` is decremented to -1.
The loop terminates since `n` is now 0.
The function returns the last Fibonacci number generated, which is 13.
