The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, two variables `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 1 (since ( n = 1 )).
First Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which is odd and `is_palindrome(1)` is True.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is true.
   - Action: `odd_palindrome_count += 1` results in `odd_palindrome_count = 1`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the tuple `(even_palindrome_count, odd_palindrome_count)`, which is `(0, 1)` in this case.
