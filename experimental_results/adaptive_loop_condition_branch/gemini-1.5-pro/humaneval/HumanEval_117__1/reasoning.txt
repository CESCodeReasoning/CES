The function select_words(s, n) takes a string s("Mary had a little lamb") and an integer n(3) as its parameters.
The function returns a list of words from the string that have exactly n consonants.
The function first splits the string into a list of words.
Then, for each word in the list, the function counts the number of consonants in the word.
If the number of consonants in the word is equal to n, the function adds the word to the result list.
Finally, the function returns the result list.
First Iteration (word="Mary"):
    - `word` is "Mary", len(word) is 4.
    - `i` is 0, 1, 2, 3.
    - word[i].lower() is "m", "a", "r", "y".
    - "m" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 1.
    - "a" is in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is still 1.
    - "r" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 2.
    - "y" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 3.
    - n_consonants is not equal to n, so the word is not added to the result list.
Second Iteration (word="had"):
    - `word` is "had", len(word) is 3.
    - `i` is 0, 1, 2.
    - word[i].lower() is "h", "a", "d".
    - "h" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 1.
    - "a" is in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is still 1.
    - "d" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 2.
    - n_consonants is equal to n, so the word is added to the result list.
Third Iteration (word="a"):
    - `word` is "a", len(word) is 1.
    - `i` is 0.
    - word[i].lower() is "a".
    - "a" is in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 0.
    - n_consonants is not equal to n, so the word is not added to the result list.
Fourth Iteration (word="little"):
    - `word` is "little", len(word) is 6.
    - `i` is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
    - word[i].lower() is "l", "i", "t", "t", "l", "e".
    - "l" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 1.
    - "i" is in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is still 1.
    - "t" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 2.
    - "t" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 3.
    - "l" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 4.
    - "e" is in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is still 4.
    - n_consonants is not equal to n, so the word is not added to the result list.
Fifth Iteration (word="lamb"):
    - `word` is "lamb", len(word) is 4.
    - `i` is 0, 1, 2, 3.
    - word[i].lower() is "l", "a", "m", "b".
    - "l" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 1.
    - "a" is in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is still 1.
    - "m" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 2.
    - "b" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 3.
    - n_consonants is equal to n, so the word is added to the result list.
