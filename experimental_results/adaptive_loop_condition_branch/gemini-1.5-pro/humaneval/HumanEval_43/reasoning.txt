The function pairs_sum_to_zero(l) takes a list of numbers([1, 3, 5, 0]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2 and 3.
    - l1=1: compare with 3, 5, 0:
        - When j = 1 (l[j]=3), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=5), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=0), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is True, the if branch is taken. Return True.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2 and 3.
    - l1=3: compare with 5, 0:
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=5), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=0), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3.
    - l1=5: compare with 0:
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=0), the condition `l1 + l[j] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, no more elements to compare.
