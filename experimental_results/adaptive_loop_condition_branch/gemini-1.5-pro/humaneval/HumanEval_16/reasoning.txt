The function count_distinct_characters takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string.
To determine the number of distinct characters in the input string, we need to first convert the string to lowercase and then find the number of unique characters in the lowercase string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function count_distinct_characters on the input string 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' is 5.
