[REASONING]
The function decimal_to_binary takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation as a string.
To determine the output of executing the function decimal_to_binary on the input 32, we need to convert 32 to binary.
32 in binary is 100000.
Therefore, the output of executing the function decimal_to_binary on the input 32 is "db100000db".
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    return "db" + bin(decimal)[2:] + "db"
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
"db100000db"
[/OUTPUT]
