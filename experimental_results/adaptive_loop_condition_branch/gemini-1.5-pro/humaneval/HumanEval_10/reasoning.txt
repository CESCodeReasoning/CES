The function `is_palindrome` is called with the string 'jerry'.
The function first checks if the string is empty, which it is not, so the if statement is skipped.
The function then initializes the variable `beginning_of_suffix` to 0.
The while loop is entered, and the function `is_palindrome` is called recursively with the substring of the string starting at index `beginning_of_suffix`.
The first time through the loop, the substring is 'jerry', which is not a palindrome, so the loop continues.
The second time through the loop, the substring is 'erry', which is not a palindrome, so the loop continues.
The third time through the loop, the substring is 'rry', which is not a palindrome, so the loop continues.
The fourth time through the loop, the substring is 'ry', which is not a palindrome, so the loop continues.
The fifth time through the loop, the substring is 'y', which is a palindrome, so the loop exits.
The function then returns the string 'jerry' concatenated with the reverse of the substring 'y', which is 'y'.
