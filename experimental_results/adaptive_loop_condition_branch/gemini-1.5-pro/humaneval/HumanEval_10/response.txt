[REASONING]
The function `is_palindrome` is called with the string 'jerry'.
The function first checks if the string is empty, which it is not, so the if statement is skipped.
The function then initializes the variable `beginning_of_suffix` to 0.
The while loop is entered, and the function `is_palindrome` is called recursively with the substring of the string starting at index `beginning_of_suffix`.
The first time through the loop, the substring is 'jerry', which is not a palindrome, so the loop continues.
The second time through the loop, the substring is 'erry', which is not a palindrome, so the loop continues.
The third time through the loop, the substring is 'rry', which is not a palindrome, so the loop continues.
The fourth time through the loop, the substring is 'ry', which is not a palindrome, so the loop continues.
The fifth time through the loop, the substring is 'y', which is a palindrome, so the loop exits.
The function then returns the string 'jerry' concatenated with the reverse of the substring 'y', which is 'y'.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *

def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool: ## [CONDITION](not string)=False[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=N[/BRANCH]
    if not string:
        return ''

    beginning_of_suffix = 0

    while not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]): ## [CONDITION](not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]))=True[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=Y[/BRANCH]
        beginning_of_suffix += 1 ## [STATE]beginning_of_suffix=[1, 2, 3, 4][/STATE]

    return string + string[:beginning_of_suffix][::-1] ## [STATE]beginning_of_suffix=[5][/STATE]
