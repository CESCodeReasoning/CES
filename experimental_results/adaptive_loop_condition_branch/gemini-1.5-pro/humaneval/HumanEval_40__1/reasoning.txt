The function triples_sum_to_zero(l: list) takes a list of integers as its parameter.
The function returns True if there are three elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise.
The function uses three nested loops to iterate through all possible triples of elements in the list.
For each triple of elements, the function checks if the sum of the three elements is equal to zero.
If the sum is equal to zero, the function returns True.
Otherwise, the function continues to the next triple of elements.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - l[i]=2: compare with l[j] for j=1, 2, 3, 4 and 5:
        - When j = 1 (l[j]=4), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=-5), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is True, the if branch is taken. Return True.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - No more elements to compare.
