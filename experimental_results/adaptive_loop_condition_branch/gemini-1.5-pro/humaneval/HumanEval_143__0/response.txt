[REASONING]
The function words_in_sentence(sentence) takes a sentence as its parameter.
The function splits the sentence into a list of words.
For each word in the list, the function checks if the length of the word is 1.
If the length of the word is 1, the function sets a flag to 1.
The function then checks if the length of the word is divisible by any number between 2 and the length of the word.
If the length of the word is divisible by any number between 2 and the length of the word, the function sets the flag to 1.
If the flag is 0 or the length of the word is 2, the function adds the word to a new list.
The function then returns the new list joined by a space.
First Iteration (word="there"):
    - `word` is "there", `len(word)` is 5.
    - `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - `range(2, len(word))` is [2, 3, 4].
    - `len(word) % i == 0` is False for all i in [2, 3, 4], the if branch is not taken.
    - `flg == 0 or len(word) == 2` is True, the if branch is taken. Append "there" to new_lst.
Second Iteration (word="is"):
    - `word` is "is", `len(word)` is 2.
    - `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - `range(2, len(word))` is empty, the for loop is skipped.
    - `flg == 0 or len(word) == 2` is True, the if branch is taken. Append "is" to new_lst.
Third Iteration (word="no"):
    - `word` is "no", `len(word)` is 2.
    - `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - `range(2, len(word))` is empty, the for loop is skipped.
    - `flg == 0 or len(word) == 2` is True, the if branch is taken. Append "no" to new_lst.
Forth Iteration (word="place"):
    - `word` is "place", `len(word)` is 5.
    - `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - `range(2, len(word))` is [2, 3, 4].
    - `len(word) % i == 0` is False for all i in [2, 3, 4], the if branch is not taken.
    - `flg == 0 or len(word) == 2` is True, the if branch is taken. Append "place" to new_lst.
Fifth Iteration (word="available"):
    - `word` is "available", `len(word)` is 9.
    - `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - `range(2, len(word))` is [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
    - `len(word) % i == 0` is True for i=3, the if branch is taken. Set `flg` to 1.
    - `flg == 0 or len(word) == 2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth Iteration (word="here"):
    - `word` is "here", `len(word)` is 4.
    - `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - `range(2, len(word))` is [2, 3].
    - `len(word) % i == 0` is True for i=2, the if branch is taken. Set `flg` to 1.
    - `flg == 0 or len(word) == 2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
