The function `is_happy` is called with ( s = "aabb" ).
The length of the string is 4, which is greater than 3.
The loop iterates from 0 to 2 (since ( len(s) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `s[i]` is 'a', `s[i + 1]` is 'a', and `s[i + 2]` is 'b'.
   - The condition `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]` is false.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `s[i]` is 'a', `s[i + 1]` is 'b', and `s[i + 2]` is 'b'.
   - The condition `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]` is false.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `s[i]` is 'b', `s[i + 1]` is 'b', and `s[i + 2]` is 'a'.
   - The condition `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]` is false.
Since the loop completes without finding any adjacent equal characters, the function returns True.
