[REASONING]
The function `is_simple_power` is called with ( x = 128, n = 4 ).
The first condition ( n == 1 ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The variable `power` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates while ( power < x ).
First Iteration (power = 1):
    - ( power < x ) is satisfied when power=1 and x=128
    - `power = power * n` updates `power` to 4 ( 1 * 4 = 4 ).
Second Iteration (power = 4):
    - ( power < x ) is satisfied when power=4 and x=128
    - `power = power * n` updates `power` to 16 ( 4 * 4 = 16 ).
Third Iteration (power = 16):
    - ( power < x ) is satisfied when power=16 and x=128
    - `power = power * n` updates `power` to 64 ( 16 * 4 = 64 ).
Fourth Iteration (power = 64):
    - ( power < x ) is satisfied when power=64 and x=128
    - `power = power * n` updates `power` to 256 ( 64 * 4 = 256 ).
Fifth Iteration (power = 256):
    - ( power < x ) is not satisfied when power=256 and x=128
    - The loop terminates.
After the loop completes, the condition ( power == x ) is not satisfied, therefore the function returns `False` as the output.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def is_simple_power(x, n):
    if (n == 1): ## [CONDITION](n == 1)=False[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=N[/BRANCH]
        return (x == 1)
    power = 1
    while (power < x): ## [STATE](power < x)=False[/STATE][STATE]power=[1, 4, 16, 64, 256][/STATE][STATE]x=[128][/STATE]
        power = power * n
    return (power == x)
