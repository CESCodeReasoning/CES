The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 10, b = 15 ).
First Iteration:
    - b = 15, a % b = 10.
    - a = 15, b = 10.
Second Iteration:
    - b = 10, a % b = 5.
    - a = 10, b = 5.
Third Iteration:
    - b = 5, a % b = 0.
    - a = 5, b = 0.
b is 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 5.
