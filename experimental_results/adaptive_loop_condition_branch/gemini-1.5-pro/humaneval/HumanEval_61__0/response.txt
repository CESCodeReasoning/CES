[REASONING]
The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = ")((" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over each character in the string.
First Iteration (b = "(")
   - The character is an opening bracket, so `depth` is incremented to 1.
Second Iteration (b = ")")
   - The character is a closing bracket, so `depth` is decremented to 0.
Third Iteration (b = "(")
   - The character is an opening bracket, so `depth` is incremented to 1.
   - The condition `depth < 0` is false, so the function continues.
Fourth Iteration (b = ")")
   - The character is a closing bracket, so `depth` is decremented to 0.
   - The condition `depth < 0` is false, so the function continues.
Fifth Iteration (b = "(")
   - The character is an opening bracket, so `depth` is incremented to 1.
   - The condition `depth < 0` is false, so the function continues.
Sixth Iteration (b = ")")
   - The character is a closing bracket, so `depth` is decremented to -1.
   - The condition `depth < 0` is true, so the function returns False.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets: ## [STATE]b=['(', ')', '(', ')', '('][/STATE][STATE]brackets=[")(("][/STATE]
        if b == "(": ## [CONDITION](b == "(")=[True, False, True, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, N, Y, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            depth += 1
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N, Y, N, Y, N][/BRANCH]
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0: ## [CONDITION](depth < 0)=[False, False, False, False, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N, Y][/BRANCH]
            return False
    return depth == 0
