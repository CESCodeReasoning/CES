The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "5/1", n = "3/1" ).
The function splits the input strings into numerator and denominator.
The numerator of the first fraction is 5 and the denominator is 1.
The numerator of the second fraction is 3 and the denominator is 1.
The function multiplies the numerators and denominators to get the new numerator and denominator.
The new numerator is 5 * 3 = 15 and the new denominator is 1 * 1 = 1.
The function checks if the new numerator divided by the new denominator is an integer.
15 divided by 1 is 15, which is an integer.
Therefore, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("5/1", "3/1")` is True.
