The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1, 4, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 to 0 (since ( len(arr) // 2 ) = 1 ).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `arr[i]` is 1, and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 2.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` results in `ans = 1`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is now 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1, 4, 2])` is 1.
