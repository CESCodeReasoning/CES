The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers lst as input and returns a tuple containing the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [-1, -3, -5, -6], we need to first filter out the negative integers and the positive integers from the list.
The negative integers in the list are [-1, -3, -5, -6].
The positive integers in the list are [].
The largest negative integer in the list is -1.
The smallest positive integer in the list is None.
Therefore, the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [-1, -3, -5, -6] is (-1, None).
