[REASONING]
The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '03-11-2000' ).
The date is split into three parts: month, day, and year.
The month is 3, the day is 11, and the year is 2000.
The first condition checks if the month is between 1 and 12.
The month is 3, which is between 1 and 12, so the condition is true.
The second condition checks if the month is in the list [1,3,5,7,8,10,12] and the day is less than 1 or greater than 31.
The month is 3, which is in the list [1,3,5,7,8,10,12], and the day is 11, which is not less than 1 or greater than 31, so the condition is true.
The third condition checks if the month is in the list [4,6,9,11] and the day is less than 1 or greater than 30.
The month is 3, which is not in the list [4,6,9,11], so the condition is true.
The fourth condition checks if the month is 2 and the day is less than 1 or greater than 29.
The month is 3, which is not 2, so the condition is true.
Since all the conditions are true, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('03-11-2000')` is True.
