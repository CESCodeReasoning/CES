The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "<<<><>>>>" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over each character in the string.
First Iteration (b = "<")
   - The character is "<", so the depth is incremented to 1.
Second Iteration (b = "<")
   - The character is "<", so the depth is incremented to 2.
Third Iteration (b = "<")
   - The character is "<", so the depth is incremented to 3.
Fourth Iteration (b = ">")
   - The character is ">", so the depth is decremented to 2.
Fifth Iteration (b = "<")
   - The character is "<", so the depth is incremented to 3.
Sixth Iteration (b = ">")
   - The character is ">", so the depth is decremented to 2.
Seventh Iteration (b = ">")
   - The character is ">", so the depth is decremented to 1.
Eighth Iteration (b = ">")
   - The character is ">", so the depth is decremented to 0.
Ninth Iteration (b = ">")
   - The character is ">", so the depth is decremented to -1.
   - The condition `depth < 0` is true, so the function returns False.
