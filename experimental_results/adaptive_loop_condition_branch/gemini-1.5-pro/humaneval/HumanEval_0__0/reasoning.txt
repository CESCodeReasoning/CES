The function has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) takes a list of numbers([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0]) and a threshold(0.95) as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by idx in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (idx=0):
    - `idx` is 0, `elem` is 1.0, `idx2` in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3 and 4.
    - Compare 1.0 with 2.0, 5.9, 4.0 and 5.0:
        - When `idx2` is 1 (`elem2` is 2.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken. Calculate the distance between 1.0 and 2.0, which is 1.0. The condition `distance < threshold` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` is 2 (`elem2` is 5.9), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken. Calculate the distance between 1.0 and 5.9, which is 4.9. The condition `distance < threshold` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` is 3 (`elem2` is 4.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken. Calculate the distance between 1.0 and 4.0, which is 3.0. The condition `distance < threshold` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When `idx2` is 4 (`elem2` is 5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken. Calculate the distance between 1.0 and 5.0, which is 4.0. The condition `distance < threshold` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (idx=1):
    - `idx` is 1, `elem` is 2.0, `idx2` in the inner loop is 2, 3 and 4.
    - Compare 2.0 with 5.9, 4.0 and 5.0:
        - When `idx2` is 2 (`elem2` is 5.9), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken. Calculate the distance between 2.0 and 5.9, which is 3.9. The condition `distance < threshold` is True, the if branch is taken. Return True.
Third Iteration (idx=2):
    - No more elements to compare.
