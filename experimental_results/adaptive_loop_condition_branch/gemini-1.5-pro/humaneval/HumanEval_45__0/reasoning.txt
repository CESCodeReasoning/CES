The function triangle_area takes two arguments, a and h, which represent the base and height of a triangle, respectively.
The function returns the area of the triangle, which is calculated as (base * height) / 2.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input 10 and 8, we need to substitute these values into the formula and evaluate the expression.
Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input 10 and 8 is 40.0.
