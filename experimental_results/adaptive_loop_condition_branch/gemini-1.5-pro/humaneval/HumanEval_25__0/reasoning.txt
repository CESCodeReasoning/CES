The function `factorize` is called with ( n = 3 * 2 * 3 ).
Inside the function, a list `fact` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 2 to the square root of n (since the square root of n is the largest possible factor of n).
First Iteration ( i = 2 ):
    - i <= int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) when i=2 and n=3 * 2 * 3
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `fact.append(i)` appends 2 to `fact`.
