[REASONING]
The function `split_words` is called with ( txt = "" ).
The first condition `if " " in txt` is False, the first branch is not taken.
The second condition `elif "," in txt` is also False, the second branch is not taken.
The third branch is taken.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def split_words(txt):
    if " " in txt: ## [CONDITION](" " in txt)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return txt.split()
    elif "," in txt: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return txt.replace(',', ' ').split()
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return len([i for i in txt if i.islower() and ord(i) % 2 == 0])
