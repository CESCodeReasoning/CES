[REASONING]
The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, -1, 2, -2, 5, -5, 4, -4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first operation is 1, so balance becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second operation is -1, so balance becomes 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The third operation is 2, so balance becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth operation is -2, so balance becomes 0.
Iteration 5:
    -The fifth operation is 5, so balance becomes 5.
Iteration 6:
    -The sixth operation is -5, so balance becomes 0.
Iteration 7:
    -The seventh operation is 4, so balance becomes 4.
Iteration 8:
    -The eighth operation is -4, so balance becomes 0.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0

    for op in operations: ## [STATE]op=[1, -1, 2, -2, 5, -5, 4, -4][/STATE][STATE]operations=[1, -1, 2, -2, 5, -5, 4, -4][/STATE]
        balance += op
        if balance < 0: ## [CONDITION](balance < 0)=[False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N][/BRANCH]
            return True

    return False
