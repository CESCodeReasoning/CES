The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, -1, 2, -2, 5, -5, 4, -4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first operation is 1, so balance becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second operation is -1, so balance becomes 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The third operation is 2, so balance becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth operation is -2, so balance becomes 0.
Iteration 5:
    -The fifth operation is 5, so balance becomes 5.
Iteration 6:
    -The sixth operation is -5, so balance becomes 0.
Iteration 7:
    -The seventh operation is 4, so balance becomes 4.
Iteration 8:
    -The eighth operation is -4, so balance becomes 0.
