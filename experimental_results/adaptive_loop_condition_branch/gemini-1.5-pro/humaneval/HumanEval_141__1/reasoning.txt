The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = '@this1_is6_valid.exe' ).
The file name is split into two parts by the '.' character, resulting in ['@this1_is6_valid', 'exe'].
The length of the resulting list is 2, which satisfies the first condition ( len(lst) != 2 ).
The second element of the list ('exe') is in the list of valid suffixes ( ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'] ), which satisfies the second condition ( not lst[1] in suf ).
The length of the first element of the list ('@this1_is6_valid') is not 0, which satisfies the third condition ( len(lst[0]) == 0 ).
The first character of the first element of the list ('@') is not alphabetic, which does not satisfy the fourth condition ( not lst[0][0].isalpha() ).
Therefore, the function returns 'No'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `file_name_check('@this1_is6_valid.exe')` is 'No'.
