[REASONING]
The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with ( n = 9 ).
Inside the function, two variables `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 9 (since ( n = 9 )).
First Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which is odd and `is_palindrome(1)` is True.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is true.
   - Action: `odd_palindrome_count += 1` results in `odd_palindrome_count = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which is even and `is_palindrome(2)` is False.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is false.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0 and is_palindrome(i)` is also false.
   - No action is taken.
Third Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which is odd and `is_palindrome(3)` is True.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is true.
   - Action: `odd_palindrome_count += 1` results in `odd_palindrome_count = 2`.
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which is even and `is_palindrome(4)` is False.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is false.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0 and is_palindrome(i)` is also false.
   - No action is taken.
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which is odd and `is_palindrome(5)` is True.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is true.
   - Action: `odd_palindrome_count += 1` results in `odd_palindrome_count = 3`.
Sixth Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is 6, which is even and `is_palindrome(6)` is False.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is false.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0 and is_palindrome(i)` is also false.
   - No action is taken.
Seventh Iteration (i = 7)
   - `i` is 7, which is odd and `is_palindrome(7)` is True.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is true.
   - Action: `odd_palindrome_count += 1` results in `odd_palindrome_count = 4`.
Eighth Iteration (i = 8)
   - `i` is 8, which is even and `is_palindrome(8)` is False.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is false.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0 and is_palindrome(i)` is also false.
   - No action is taken.
Ninth Iteration (i = 9)
   - `i` is 9, which is odd and `is_palindrome(9)` is True.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is true.
   - Action: `odd_palindrome_count += 1` results in `odd_palindrome_count = 5`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the tuple `(even_palindrome_count, odd_palindrome_count)`, which is `(0, 5)`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_palindrome(9)` is `(0, 5)`.

            even_palindrome_count += 1
    return (even_palindrome_count, odd_palindrome_count)
