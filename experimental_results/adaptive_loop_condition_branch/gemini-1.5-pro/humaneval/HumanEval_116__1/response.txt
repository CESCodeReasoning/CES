[REASONING]
The function sort_array takes an array arr as input and returns a sorted array based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each element in arr.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [], we need to first sort the array in ascending order.
Since the input array is empty, the sorted array is also empty.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [] is [].
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def sort_array(arr):
    return sorted(sorted(arr), key=lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1'))
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[]
