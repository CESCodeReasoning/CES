The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "abcCd" ).
The string `s` is not empty, so the if branch is not taken.
The function returns the sum of the ASCII values of the uppercase characters in the string.
The string `s` contains two uppercase characters, 'C' and 'D', so the function returns the sum of their ASCII values, which is 132 (67 + 65).
