[REASONING]
The function get_positive takes a list l as input and returns a new list containing only the positive elements of l.
To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6], we need to iterate over the elements of the input list and check if each element is greater than 0.
If an element is greater than 0, we add it to the new list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6] is [4, 5, 6].
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [e for e in l if [CONDITION]e > 0[/CONDITION]]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[4, 5, 6]
[/OUTPUT]
