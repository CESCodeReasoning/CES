The function words_in_sentence(sentence) takes a sentence as its parameter.
The function splits the sentence into a list of words.
For each word in the list, the function checks if the length of the word is 1.
If the length of the word is 1, the function sets a flag to 1.
The function then checks if the length of the word is divisible by any number between 2 and the length of the word.
If the length of the word is divisible by any number between 2 and the length of the word, the function sets the flag to 1.
If the flag is 0 or the length of the word is 2, the function adds the word to a new list.
The function then returns the new list joined by a space.
First Iteration (word="This"):
    - `word` is "This", the length of the word is 4.
    - The condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - The condition `len(word)%i == 0` is False for i=2 and i=3, the if branch is not taken.
    - The condition `flg == 0 or len(word) == 2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (word="is"):
    - `word` is "is", the length of the word is 2.
    - The condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - The condition `len(word)%i == 0` is not checked because the outer loop starts from i=2.
    - The condition `flg == 0 or len(word) == 2` is True, the if branch is taken. Append "is" to new_lst.
Third Iteration (word="a"):
    - `word` is "a", the length of the word is 1.
    - The condition `len(word) == 1` is True, the if branch is taken. Set flg to 1.
    - The condition `len(word)%i == 0` is not checked because the outer loop starts from i=2.
    - The condition `flg == 0 or len(word) == 2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (word="test"):
    - `word` is "test", the length of the word is 4.
    - The condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - The condition `len(word)%i == 0` is True for i=2, the if branch is taken. Set flg to 1.
    - The condition `flg == 0 or len(word) == 2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
