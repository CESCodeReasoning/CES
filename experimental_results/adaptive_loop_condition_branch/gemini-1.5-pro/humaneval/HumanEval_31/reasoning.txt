The function `is_prime` is called with ( n = 6 ).
First, it checks if ( n < 2 ), which is false since ( n = 6 ).
Then, it enters the loop that iterates from 2 to ( n - 1 ), which is from 2 to 5.
Iteration 1:
    - k is 2, and ( n % k == 0 ) is false since ( 6 % 2 != 0 ).
Iteration 2:
    - k is 3, and ( n % k == 0 ) is false since ( 6 % 3 != 0 ).
Iteration 3:
    - k is 4, and ( n % k == 0 ) is false since ( 6 % 4 != 0 ).
Iteration 4:
    - k is 5, and ( n % k == 0 ) is false since ( 6 % 5 != 0 ).
Since no iteration found a divisor for n, the function returns True.
