The function `rounded_avg` is called with ( n = 560, m = 851 ).
First, the condition ( m < n ) is checked, which is False, so the if branch is not taken.
Next, the variable `summation` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 560 through 851 (since ( n = 560 ) and ( m = 851 )).
First Iteration (i = 560):
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 560 ( 0 + 560 = 560 ).
Second Iteration (i = 561):
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 1121 ( 560 + 561 = 1121 ).
Third Iteration (i = 562)
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 1682 ( 1121 + 561 = 1682 ).
...
292nd Iteration (i = 851)
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 363321 ( 362470 + 851 = 363321 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns `bin(round(summation / (m - n + 1)))`.
The value of `summation` is 363321, and the value of `(m - n + 1)` is ( 851 - 560 + 1 ) = 292.
Therefore, the function returns `bin(round(363321 / 292))`, which is `bin(1244)`.
