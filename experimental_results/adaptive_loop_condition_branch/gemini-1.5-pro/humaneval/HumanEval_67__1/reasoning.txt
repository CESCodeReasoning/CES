The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "5 apples and 6 oranges", n = 21 ).
Inside the function, a list `lis` is initialized to be empty.
The string `s` is split by the space character, resulting in a list of strings `["5", "apples", "and", "6", "oranges"]`.
The loop iterates over the list of strings.
First Iteration (i = "5")
   - `i` is a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is true.
   - Action: `lis.append(int(i))` appends the integer value of `i` (which is 5) to the list `lis`.
Second Iteration (i = "apples")
   - `i` is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration without any action.
Third Iteration (i = "and")
   - `i` is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration without any action.
Fourth Iteration (i = "6")
   - `i` is a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is true.
   - Action: `lis.append(int(i))` appends the integer value of `i` (which is 6) to the list `lis`.
Fifth Iteration (i = "oranges")
   - `i` is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration without any action.
After the loop completes, the list `lis` contains two integers: [5, 6].
The function returns the value of `n - sum(lis)`, which is 21 - (5 + 6) = 10.
