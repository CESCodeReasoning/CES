The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [1, -1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` is initialized to 0 and `s` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of nums is 1.
    -s becomes 1 (0 + 1).
    -max_sum is still 0.
    -s is not less than 0, so the if condition is not met.
    -max_sum is updated to 1 (max(1, 0)).

Iteration 2:
    -The second element of nums is -1.
    -s becomes 0 (1 + (-1)).
    -max_sum is still 1.
    -s is less than 0, so the if condition is met.
    -s is reset to 0.
    -max_sum is still 1.

After the loop, max_sum is 1.
Since max_sum is not 0, the if condition is not met.
The function returns the negative of max_sum, which is -1.
