[REASONING]
The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "123456789ABCDEF0" ).
Inside the function, a tuple `primes` is defined with the values ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D').
A variable `total` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 to the length of the string `num` (which is 16).
Iteration 1:
    - The character at index 0 is '1', which is not in `primes`, so the condition is false and the total remains 0.
Iteration 2:
    - The character at index 1 is '2', which is in `primes`, so the condition is true and the total becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    - The character at index 2 is '3', which is in `primes`, so the condition is true and the total becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    - The character at index 3 is '4', which is not in `primes`, so the condition is false and the total remains 2.
Iteration 5:
    - The character at index 4 is '5', which is in `primes`, so the condition is true and the total becomes 3.
Iteration 6:
    - The character at index 5 is '6', which is not in `primes`, so the condition is false and the total remains 3.
Iteration 7:
    - The character at index 6 is '7', which is in `primes`, so the condition is true and the total becomes 4.
Iteration 8:
    - The character at index 7 is '8', which is not in `primes`, so the condition is false and the total remains 4.
Iteration 9:
    - The character at index 8 is '9', which is not in `primes`, so the condition is false and the total remains 4.
Iteration 10:
    - The character at index 9 is 'A', which is not in `primes`, so the condition is false and the total remains 4.
Iteration 11:
    - The character at index 10 is 'B', which is in `primes`, so the condition is true and the total becomes 5.
Iteration 12:
    - The character at index 11 is 'C', which is not in `primes`, so the condition is false and the total remains 5.
Iteration 13:
    - The character at index 12 is 'D', which is in `primes`, so the condition is true and the total becomes 6.
Iteration 14:
    - The character at index 13 is 'E', which is not in `primes`, so the condition is false and the total remains 6.
Iteration 15:
    - The character at index 14 is 'F', which is not in `primes`, so the condition is false and the total remains 6.
Iteration 16:
    - The character at index 15 is '0', which is not in `primes`, so the condition is false and the total remains 6.
