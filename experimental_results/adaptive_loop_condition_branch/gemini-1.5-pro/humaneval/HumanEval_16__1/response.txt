[REASONING]
The function count_distinct_characters takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string.
To determine the number of distinct characters in the string 'aaaaAAAAaaaa', we first need to convert the string to lowercase using the lower() method.
Then, we need to create a set of the characters in the string using the set() function.
Finally, we need to return the length of the set using the len() function.
Therefore, the number of distinct characters in the string 'aaaaAAAAaaaa' is 1.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    # Convert the string to lowercase
    string = string.lower()
    # Create a set of the characters in the string
    characters = set(string)
    # Return the length of the set
    return len(characters)
