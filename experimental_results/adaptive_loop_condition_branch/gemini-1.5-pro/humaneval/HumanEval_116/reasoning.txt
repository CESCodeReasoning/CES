The function sort_array takes an array arr as input and returns a sorted array based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each element in arr.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4], we need to first sort the array in ascending order.
After sorting, the array becomes [1,2,3,4,5].
Next, we need to sort the array again based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each element.
The binary representation of 1 is "1", the binary representation of 2 is "10", the binary representation of 3 is "11", the binary representation of 4 is "100", and the binary representation of 5 is "101".
Counting the number of 1s in each binary representation, we get [1,1,2,1,2].
Sorting the array based on this count, we get [1,2,3,4,5].
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4] is [1,2,3,4,5].
