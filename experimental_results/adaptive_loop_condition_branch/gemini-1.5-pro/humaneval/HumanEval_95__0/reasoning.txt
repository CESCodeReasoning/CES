The function `check_dict_case` is called with ( dict = {"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345" } ).
The function first checks if the dictionary is empty. Since the dictionary is not empty, the function proceeds to check the case of the keys in the dictionary.

The function initializes a variable `state` to "start".
The function then iterates over the keys in the dictionary.
For each key, the function checks if the key is a string. If the key is not a string, the function sets `state` to "mixed" and breaks out of the loop.
If the key is a string, the function checks if the `state` is "start". If the `state` is "start", the function checks if the key is uppercase. If the key is uppercase, the function sets `state` to "upper". If the key is lowercase, the function sets `state` to "lower". If the key is neither uppercase nor lowercase, the function breaks out of the loop.
If the `state` is "upper" or "lower", the function checks if the key is uppercase or lowercase, respectively. If the key is not uppercase or lowercase, the function sets `state` to "mixed" and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop has finished, the function returns True if the `state` is "upper" or "lower", and False otherwise.

In this case, the function returns True because all of the keys in the dictionary are uppercase.
