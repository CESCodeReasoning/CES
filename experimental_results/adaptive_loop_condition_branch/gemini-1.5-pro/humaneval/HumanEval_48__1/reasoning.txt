The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'aaaaa' ).
Inside the function, a loop iterates from 0 to 4 (since len(text) = 5).
Iteration 1:
    - i = 0, text[i] = 'a', text[len(text) - 1 - i] = 'a', so the condition is True.
Iteration 2:
    - i = 1, text[i] = 'a', text[len(text) - 1 - i] = 'a', so the condition is True.
Iteration 3:
    - i = 2, text[i] = 'a', text[len(text) - 1 - i] = 'a', so the condition is True.
Iteration 4:
    - i = 3, text[i] = 'a', text[len(text) - 1 - i] = 'a', so the condition is True.
Iteration 5:
    - i = 4, text[i] = 'a', text[len(text) - 1 - i] = 'a', so the condition is True.
Since the condition is True for all iterations, the function returns True.
