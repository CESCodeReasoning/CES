The function `compare_one` is called with ( a = 5, b = 6 ).
Since both `a` and `b` are not strings, the first two if statements are skipped.
The third if statement compares the float values of `a` and `b`.
Since 5.0 is not equal to 6.0, the if statement is false and the else branch is taken.
The else branch returns `a` since 5.0 is less than 6.0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one(5, 6)` is 5.
