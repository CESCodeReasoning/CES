[REASONING]
The function `eat` is called with ( number = 2, need = 11, remaining = 5 ).
The condition `need <= remaining` is false, since 11 is not less than or equal to 5.
Therefore, the else branch is taken.
The else branch returns a list containing the sum of `number` and `remaining` (which is 7) and 0 (since `remaining` becomes 0).
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def eat(number, need, remaining):
    if (need <= remaining): ## [CONDITION](need <= remaining)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return [number + need, remaining - need]
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return [number + remaining, 0]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[7, 0]
