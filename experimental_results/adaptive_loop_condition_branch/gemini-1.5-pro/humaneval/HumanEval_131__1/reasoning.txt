The function `digits` is called with ( n = 5576543 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1 and `odd_count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The digit '5' is odd, so `product` becomes 5 and `odd_count` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The digit '5' is odd, so `product` becomes 25 and `odd_count` becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The digit '7' is odd, so `product` becomes 175 and `odd_count` becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The digit '6' is even, so `product` remains 175 and `odd_count` remains 3.
Iteration 5:
    -The digit '5' is odd, so `product` becomes 875 and `odd_count` becomes 4.
Iteration 6:
    -The digit '4' is even, so `product` remains 875 and `odd_count` remains 4.
Iteration 7:
    -The digit '3' is odd, so `product` becomes 2625 and `odd_count` becomes 5.
