The function add takes a list of integers lst as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list at odd indices.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 0, 6, 7], we need to first identify the even numbers at odd indices in the list.
The first number in the list is 4, which is at an even index, so we skip it.
The second number in the list is 0, which is at an odd index and is even, so we add it to the sum.
The third number in the list is 6, which is at an even index, so we skip it.
The fourth number in the list is 7, which is at an odd index and is odd, so we skip it.
Therefore, the sum of all the even numbers in the list at odd indices is 0.
