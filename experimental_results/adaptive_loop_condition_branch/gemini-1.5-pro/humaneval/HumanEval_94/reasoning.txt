The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 21 (since ( len(lst) = 22 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - `lst[i]` is 0, which is less than `maxx`. The first condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false.
    - The second condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is not checked since the first condition is false.
    - The `if` statement is skipped.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - `lst[i]` is 3, which is greater than `maxx`. The first condition `lst[i] > maxx` is true.
    - The second condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is checked.
    - The function `isPrime` is called with ( n = 3 ).
    - Inside the function `isPrime`, a loop iterates from 2 through 1 (since ( int(3**0.5) + 1 ) = 2 ).
    - The loop does not find any divisors for 3, so the function `isPrime` returns True.
    - The second condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The `if` statement is executed.
    - `maxx` is updated to 3.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - `lst[i]` is 2, which is less than `maxx`. The first condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false.
    - The second condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is not checked since the first condition is false.
    - The `if` statement is skipped.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - `lst[i]` is 1, which is less than `maxx`. The first condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false.
    - The second condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is not checked since the first condition is false.
    - The `if` statement is skipped.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - `lst[i]` is 3, which is less than `maxx`. The first condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false.
    - The second condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is not checked since the first condition is false.
    - The `if` statement is skipped.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - `lst[i]` is 5, which is greater than `maxx`. The first condition `lst[i] > maxx` is true.
    - The second condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is checked.
    - The function `isPrime` is called with ( n = 5 ).
    - Inside the function `isPrime`, a loop iterates from 2 through 2 (since ( int(5**0.5) + 1 ) = 3 ).
    - The loop does not find any divisors for 5, so the function `isPrime` returns True.
    - The second condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The `if` statement is executed.
    - `maxx` is updated to 5.
Seventh Iteration (i = 6):
    - `lst[i]` is 7, which is greater than `maxx`. The first condition `lst[i] > maxx` is true.
    - The second condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is checked.
    - The function `isPrime` is called with ( n = 7 ).
    - Inside the function `isPrime`, a loop iterates from 2 through 3 (since ( int(7**0.5) + 1 ) = 4 ).
    - The loop does not find any divisors for 7, so the function `isPrime` returns True.
    - The second condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The `if` statement is executed.
    - `maxx` is updated to 7.
Eighth Iteration (i = 7):
    - `lst[i]` is 4, which is less than `maxx`. The first condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false.

    - The `if` statement is skipped.
Eleventh Iteration (i = 10):
    - `lst[i]` is 5, which is less than `maxx`. The first condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false.

    - The second condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is checked.
    - The function `isPrime` is called with ( n = 181 ).
    - Inside the function `isPrime`, a loop iterates from 2 through 13 (since ( int(181**0.5) + 1 ) = 14 ).
    - The loop does not find any divisors for 181, so the function `isPrime` returns True.
