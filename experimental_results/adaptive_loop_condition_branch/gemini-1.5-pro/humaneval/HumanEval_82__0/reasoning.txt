The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Wow' ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is assigned the length of the string, which is 3.
The first conditional statement checks if the length of the string is 0 or 1. Since the length is 3, this condition is false.
The second conditional statement checks if the length of the string is divisible by any number between 2 and the length of the string.
The loop iterates from 2 to 3 (since the length of the string is 3).
The first iteration checks if the length of the string is divisible by 2. Since 3 is not divisible by 2, this condition is false.
The second iteration checks if the length of the string is divisible by 3. Since 3 is divisible by 3, this condition is true.
Since one of the conditions in the loop is true, the function returns False.
