The function `median` is called with the list `[8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7]`.
The list is sorted in ascending order, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 9]`.
The length of the sorted list is 7, which is odd.
The condition `len(l) % 2 == 1` is true, therefore the if branch is taken.
The middle index of the sorted list is `len(l) // 2`, which is 3.
The median of the list is the element at index 3, which is 7.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7])` is 7.
