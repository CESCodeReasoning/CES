The function `intersection` is called with two intervals: `interval1 = [-2, -2]` and `interval2 = [-3, -2]`.
The function first calculates the length of the intersection of the two intervals: `length = r - l = -2 - (-3) = 1`.
Then, the function checks if the length is greater than 0 and if the length is a prime number.
The function `is_prime` is called to check if the length is a prime number.
The function `is_prime` checks if the number is 1 or 0, and if it is, it returns False.
If the number is 2, it returns True.
Otherwise, it iterates from 2 to the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range.
If it is, it returns False.
If it is not, it returns True.
In this case, the length is 1, which is not a prime number, so the function `is_prime` returns False.
Therefore, the function `intersection` returns "NO".
