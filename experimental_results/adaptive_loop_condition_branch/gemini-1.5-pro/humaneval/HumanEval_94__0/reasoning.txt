The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [127, 97, 8192] ).
Inside the function, a nested function `isPrime` is defined to check if a number is prime.
The function `skjkasdkd` initializes `maxx` to 0 and `i` to 0.
The while loop iterates over the elements of the list `lst`.
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is evaluated.
    - `lst[i]` is 127, which is greater than `maxx` (0).
    - `isPrime(lst[i])` is called to check if 127 is prime.
    - The loop in `isPrime` iterates from 2 to the square root of 127 (which is 11).
    - None of the numbers in this range divide 127 evenly, so `isPrime(lst[i])` returns True.
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is true, so `maxx` is updated to 127.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is evaluated.
    - `lst[i]` is 97, which is less than `maxx` (127).
    - The condition is false, so `maxx` is not updated.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is evaluated.
    - `lst[i]` is 8192, which is greater than `maxx` (127).
    - `isPrime(lst[i])` is called to check if 8192 is prime.
    - The loop in `isPrime` iterates from 2 to the square root of 8192 (which is 90).
    - 8192 is divisible by 2, so `isPrime(lst[i])` returns False.
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is false, so `maxx` is not updated.
After the loop completes, `maxx` is 127.
The function then calculates the sum of the digits of `maxx` (1 + 2 + 7 = 10) and returns this value.
