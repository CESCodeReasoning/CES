The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a new list where the elements at indices 0, 3, 6, ... are sorted in ascending order.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], we need to first create a copy of the input list.
Then, we need to sort the elements at indices 0, 3, 6, ... in ascending order.
Finally, we need to return the new list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] is [-10, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, 5].
