The function get_row takes a list of lists lst and an element x as input, and returns a list of the coordinates of all occurrences of x in lst, sorted first by column (in descending order) and then by row.

To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2, we need to find all occurrences of 2 in [[1]] and sort them first by column (in descending order) and then by row.

There are no occurrences of 2 in [[1]], so the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2 is an empty list.
