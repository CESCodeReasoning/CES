[REASONING]
The function get_row takes a list of lists lst and an element x as input, and returns a list of the coordinates of all occurrences of x in lst, sorted first by column (in descending order) and then by row.

To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2, we need to find all occurrences of 2 in [[1]] and sort them first by column (in descending order) and then by row.

There are no occurrences of 2 in [[1]], so the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2 is an empty list.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def get_row(lst, x):
    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst))
              for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
    return sorted(
        sorted(
            coords,
            key=lambda x: x[1],
            reverse=True),
        key=lambda x: x[0])

# lst = [[1]]
# x = 2
# coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst)) for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
# [STATE]coords = [][/STATE]
# return sorted(
#     sorted(
#         coords,
#         key=lambda x: x[1],
#         reverse=True),
#     key=lambda x: x[0])
