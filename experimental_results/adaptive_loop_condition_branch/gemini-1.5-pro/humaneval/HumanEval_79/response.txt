[REASONING]
The function decimal_to_binary takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation as a string.
To determine the output of executing the function decimal_to_binary on the input 0, we need to convert 0 to its binary representation.
The binary representation of 0 is "0".
Therefore, the output of executing the function decimal_to_binary on the input 0 is "db0db".
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
from typing import *
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    return "db" + bin(decimal)[2:] + "db"
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
"db0db"
[/OUTPUT]
