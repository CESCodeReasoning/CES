The function `fix_spaces` is called with ( text = "Exa   mple" ).
Inside the function, a variable `new_text` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates through the characters in the text.
First Iteration ( i = 0 ):
    - text[i] is "E".
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 2` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 0` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` appends "E" to `new_text`.
    - `start` and `end` are both set to 1.
Second Iteration ( i = 1 ):
    - text[i] is "x".
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 2` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 0` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` appends "x" to `new_text`.
    - `start` and `end` are both set to 2.
Third Iteration ( i = 2 ):
    - text[i] is "a".
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 2` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 0` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` appends "a" to `new_text`.
    - `start` and `end` are both set to 3.
Fourth Iteration ( i = 3 ):
    - text[i] is " ".
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end` is incremented to 4.
Fifth Iteration ( i = 4 ):
    - text[i] is " ".
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end` is incremented to 5.
Sixth Iteration ( i = 5 ):
    - text[i] is " ".
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end` is incremented to 6.
Seventh Iteration ( i = 6 ):
    - text[i] is "m".
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 2` is true. The first branch is taken. `new_text += "-" + text[i]` appends "-m" to `new_text`.
    - `start` and `end` are both set to 7.
Eighth Iteration ( i = 7 ):
    - text[i] is "p".
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 2` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 0` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` appends "p" to `new_text`.
    - `start` and `end` are both set to 8.
Ninth Iteration ( i = 8 ):
    - text[i] is "l".
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 2` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 0` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` appends "l" to `new_text`.
    - `start` and `end` are both set to 9.
Tenth Iteration ( i = 9 ):
    - text[i] is "e".
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 2` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 0` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` appends "e" to `new_text`.
    - `start` and `end` are both set to 10.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `new_text`, which is "Exa-mple".
