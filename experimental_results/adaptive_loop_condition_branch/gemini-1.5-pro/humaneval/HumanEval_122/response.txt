[REASONING]
The function add_elements takes an array arr and an integer k as input and returns the sum of the elements in the first k positions of the array that have a string representation of length less than or equal to 2.
To determine the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99] and k=3, we need to first identify the elements in the first 3 positions of the array that have a string representation of length less than or equal to 2.
The elements in the first 3 positions of the array are 1, -2, and -3.
The string representation of 1 has length 1, the string representation of -2 has length 2, and the string representation of -3 has length 2.
Therefore, the elements in the first 3 positions of the array that have a string representation of length less than or equal to 2 are 1, -2, and -3.
The sum of these elements is 1 + (-2) + (-3) = -4.
Therefore, the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99] and k=3 is -4.

[ANSWER]
```python
from typing import *
def add_elements(arr, k):
    return sum(elem for elem in arr[:k] if len(str(elem)) <= 2)
```
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
-4
