The function select_words(s, n) takes a string s("Hello world") and an integer n(4) as its parameters.
The function splits the string into a list of words using the split() method.
For each word in the list, the function counts the number of consonants in the word.
If the number of consonants in the word is equal to n, the function adds the word to the result list.
The function returns the result list.
First Iteration (word="Hello"):
    - `word` is "Hello", len(word) is 5.
    - `i` is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
    - word[i].lower() is "h", "e", "l", "l", "o".
    - "h" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 1.
    - "e" is in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is still 1.
    - "l" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 2.
    - "l" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is still 2.
    - "o" is in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is still 2.
    - n_consonants is not equal to n, so the word is not added to the result list.
Second Iteration (word="world"):
    - `word` is "world", len(word) is 5.
    - `i` is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
    - word[i].lower() is "w", "o", "r", "l", "d".
    - "w" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 1.
    - "o" is in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is still 1.
    - "r" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 2.
    - "l" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 3.
    - "d" is not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], so n_consonants is 4.
    - n_consonants is equal to n, so the word is added to the result list.
