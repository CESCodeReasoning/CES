The function right_angle_triangle takes three integers a, b, and c as input and returns True if the three integers satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angle triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
To determine the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input 7, 24, and 25, we need to check if any of the following three conditions is satisfied:
1. a * a == b * b + c * c
2. b * b == a * a + c * c
3. c * c == a * a + b * b
We can check each condition one by one.
1. a * a == b * b + c * c
7 * 7 == 24 * 24 + 25 * 25
49 == 576 + 625
49 == 1201
[CONDITION]False[/CONDITION]
[BRANCH]N[/BRANCH]
2. b * b == a * a + c * c
24 * 24 == 7 * 7 + 25 * 25
576 == 49 + 625
576 == 674
[CONDITION]False[/CONDITION]
[BRANCH]N[/BRANCH]
3. c * c == a * a + b * b
25 * 25 == 7 * 7 + 24 * 24
625 == 49 + 576
625 == 625
[CONDITION]True[/CONDITION]
[BRANCH]Y[/BRANCH]
Therefore, the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input 7, 24, and 25 is True.
