[REASONING]
The function concatenate takes a list of strings as input and returns the concatenation of all the strings in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function concatenate on the input [], we need to concatenate all the strings in the list.
Since the list is empty, the output of executing the function concatenate on the input [] is an empty string.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    return ''.join(strings)
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
