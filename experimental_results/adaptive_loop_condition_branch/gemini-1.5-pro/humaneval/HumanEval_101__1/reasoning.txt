The function `words_string` is called with ( s = "One,, two, three, four, five, six," ).
The function first checks if the input string `s` is empty. Since `s` is not empty, the function proceeds to process the string.

The function initializes an empty list `s_list` to store the characters of the string `s`.

The function then iterates through each character `letter` in the string `s`.

For each character `letter`, the function checks if it is a comma (,). If it is a comma, the function appends a space character to the list `s_list`. Otherwise, the function appends the character `letter` to the list `s_list`.

After iterating through all the characters in the string `s`, the function joins the characters in the list `s_list` into a single string using the `join` method. The resulting string is then split into a list of words using the `split` method.

The function finally returns the list of words.
