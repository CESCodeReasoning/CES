The function `do_algebra` is called with (operator = ['+', '*', '-'], operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]).
Inside the function, a variable `expression` is initialized to '2'.
The loop iterates over the elements of `operator` and `operand[1:]` in parallel.
First Iteration (oprt = '+', oprn = 3):
    `expression += oprt + str(oprn)` results in `expression = '2+3'`.
Second Iteration (oprt = '*', oprn = 4):
    `expression += oprt + str(oprn)` results in `expression = '2+3*4'`.
Third Iteration (oprt = '-', oprn = 5):
    `expression += oprt + str(oprn)` results in `expression = '2+3*4-5'`.
Finally, `eval(expression)` is called, which evaluates the string `expression` as a Python expression and returns the result, which is 9.
