The function filter_by_prefix takes a list of strings and a prefix as input, and returns a list of strings that start with the given prefix.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_prefix on the input ['abc', 'abcd', 'abcde'], 'abc', we need to check if each string in the input list starts with the prefix 'abc'.
The first string 'abc' starts with the prefix 'abc', so it is included in the output list.
The second string 'abcd' starts with the prefix 'abc', so it is included in the output list.
The third string 'abcde' does not start with the prefix 'abc', so it is not included in the output list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_by_prefix on the input ['abc', 'abcd', 'abcde'], 'abc' is ['abc', 'abcd'].
