[REASONING]
The function `fibfib` is called with ( n = 10 ).
The first condition ( n == 0 ) is false, so the first branch is not taken.
The second condition ( n == 1 ) is false, so the second branch is not taken.
The third condition ( n == 2 ) is false, so the third branch is not taken.
Therefore, the function proceeds to the last line, which is a recursive call to `fibfib` with ( n - 1 ), ( n - 2 ), and ( n - 3 ).
This process continues until the base cases ( n == 0, n == 1, or n == 2 ) are reached.
The results of the recursive calls are then combined to calculate the final result.

[ANSWER]
from typing import *


def fibfib(n: int):
    if n == 0: ## [CONDITION](n == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return 0
    if n == 1: ## [CONDITION](n == 1)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return 0
    if n == 2: ## [CONDITION](n == 2)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return 1
    return fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)
