[REASONING]
The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a new list where the elements at indices 0, 3, 6, ... are sorted in ascending order.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10], we need to first make a copy of the input list.
Then, we need to sort the elements at indices 0, 3, 6, ... in ascending order.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10] is [-12, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 23, -10].

[ANSWER]
def sort_third(l: list):
    l = list(l)  # [STATE]l = [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10][/STATE]
    l[::3] = sorted(l[::3])  # [STATE]l[::3] = [-12, 4, 2, 11, -10][/STATE]
    return l  # [STATE]l = [-12, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 23, -10][/STATE]
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[-12, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 23, -10]
