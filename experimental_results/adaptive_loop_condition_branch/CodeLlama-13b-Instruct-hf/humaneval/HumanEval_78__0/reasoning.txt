The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "2020" ).
Inside the function, a variable `primes` is initialized to a tuple of prime numbers.
The loop iterates from 0 through 3 (since ( len(num) = 4 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is not in `primes`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which is in `primes`.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which is not in `primes`.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which is not in `primes`.
The loop completes, and the function returns the value of `total`, which is 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `hex_key("2020")` is 1.
