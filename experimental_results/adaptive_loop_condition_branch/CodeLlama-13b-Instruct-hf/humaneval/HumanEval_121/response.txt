<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def solution(lst):
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx%2==0 and x%2==1])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
solution([5, 8, 7, 1])    
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [PYTHON]
def solution(lst):
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx%2==0 and x%2==1])
[/PYTHON]

[TESTS]
# Test case 1:
assert solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) == 10
# Test case 2:
assert solution([5, 8, 7, 1, 3]) == 10
# Test case 3:
assert solution([5, 8, 7, 1, 3, 6]) == 10
[/TESTS]

[REASONING]
The function `solution` takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the elements at even indices that are odd.

To determine the output of the function, we need to follow these steps:

1. Iterate through the list of integers and keep track of the current index.
2. If the current index is even and the current element is odd, add it to the sum.
3. Return the sum.

[REASONING]
The output of the function `solution` is 10, which is the sum of the elements at even indices that are odd in the input list.

[OUTPUT]
10
[/OUTPUT]</s>
