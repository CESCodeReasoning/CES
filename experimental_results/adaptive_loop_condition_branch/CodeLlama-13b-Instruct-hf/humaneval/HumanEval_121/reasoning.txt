The function `solution` takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the elements at even indices that are odd.

To determine the output of the function, we need to follow these steps:

1. Iterate through the list of integers and keep track of the current index.
2. If the current index is even and the current element is odd, add it to the sum.
3. Return the sum.
