The function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter takes a string txt as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the last character of the string is a letter.
To determine the output of the function, we need to follow these steps:

1. Split the input string into a list of words using the split() method with a space as the delimiter.
2. Get the last word from the list using the [-1] index.
3. Check if the last word has only one character and if the ASCII value of the character is between 97 and 122, which corresponds to the lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
4. Return True if the last word meets the above conditions, and False otherwise.

Therefore, when we execute the function with the input "apple", the output will be True, because the last word "apple" has only one character "e" and its ASCII value is between 97 and 122.
