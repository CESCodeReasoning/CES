The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the numbers that meet the following conditions:

* The number is greater than 0.
* The number is odd.
* The number does not contain a decimal point.

To determine the output of the function, we need to iterate through the list of numbers and check if each number meets the conditions. If a number meets the conditions, we square it and add it to the sum.

In the example input, the list of numbers is [0.2, 3, 5]. The first number, 0.2, does not meet the conditions because it is less than or equal to 0, so we skip it. The second number, 3, meets the conditions because it is greater than 0 and odd, so we square it and add it to the sum. The third number, 5, also meets the conditions, so we square it and add it to the sum. Therefore, the output of the function is 25.
