<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def double_the_difference(lst):
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i%2!=0 and "." not in str(i)])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
double_the_difference([0.2, 3, 5]) 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [PYTHON]
def double_the_difference(lst):
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i%2!=0 and "." not in str(i)])
[/PYTHON]

[TESTS]
# Test case 1:
assert double_the_difference([0.2, 3, 5]) == 25
# Test case 2:
assert double_the_difference([0.2, 3, 5, 0.5]) == 25
# Test case 3:
assert double_the_difference([0.2, 3, 5, 0.5, 1.5]) == 25
[/TESTS]

[REASONING]
The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the numbers that meet the following conditions:

* The number is greater than 0.
* The number is odd.
* The number does not contain a decimal point.

To determine the output of the function, we need to iterate through the list of numbers and check if each number meets the conditions. If a number meets the conditions, we square it and add it to the sum.

In the example input, the list of numbers is [0.2, 3, 5]. The first number, 0.2, does not meet the conditions because it is less than or equal to 0, so we skip it. The second number, 3, meets the conditions because it is greater than 0 and odd, so we square it and add it to the sum. The third number, 5, also meets the conditions, so we square it and add it to the sum. Therefore, the output of the function is 25.
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
25
