The function string_to_md5 takes a string text as input and returns the MD5 hash of the text.
To determine the output of executing the function string_to_md5 on the input '', we need to calculate the MD5 hash of the empty string.
The MD5 hash of the empty string is 0xd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e, which is represented in hexadecimal format.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_to_md5 on the input '' is 0xd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e.
