The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [-5, 2, 48, 9, 4, 0, 6, 7] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of `l`, which is -5.
The loop iterates through the elements of `l`.
First Iteration (e = -5)
   - `e` is -5, which is less than `m`, so `m` remains unchanged.
Second Iteration (e = 2)
   - `e` is 2, which is greater than `m`, so `m` becomes 2.
Third Iteration (e = 48)
   - `e` is 48, which is greater than `m`, so `m` becomes 48.
Fourth Iteration (e = 9)
   - `e` is 9, which is greater than `m`, so `m` becomes 9.
Fifth Iteration (e = 4)
   - `e` is 4, which is less than `m`, so `m` remains 9.
Sixth Iteration (e = 0)
   - `e` is 0, which is less than `m`, so `m` remains 9.
Seventh Iteration (e = 6)
   - `e` is 6, which is greater than `m`, so `m` becomes 6.
Eighth Iteration (e = 7)
   - `e` is 7, which is greater than `m`, so `m` becomes 7.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `m`, which is 7.

Therefore, the final output of the function `max_element([-5, 2, 48, 9, 4, 0, 6, 7])` is 7.
