The function filter_by_prefix takes two arguments: a list of strings (strings) and a string (prefix). It returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that start with the given prefix.

To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_prefix on the input [[] and 'john', we need to iterate over the input list and check if each string starts with the given prefix. Since the input list is empty, the output list will also be empty.
