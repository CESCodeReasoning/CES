The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = '@this1_is6_valid.exe' ).
The file name is split into a list of two elements using the separator '.'.
The list is [ '@this1_is6_valid', 'exe' ].
The length of the list is 2, which does not satisfy the condition ( len(lst) != 2 ).
The if branch is not taken and the method returns 'No'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `file_name_check('@this1_is6_valid.exe')` is 'No'.
