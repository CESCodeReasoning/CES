The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with ( n = 9 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The value of `i` is 1, which is odd.
    - The condition `i % 2 == 1` is true.
    - The condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    - The `elif` block is not executed.
    - The `else` block is executed, and `odd_palindrome_count` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The value of `i` is 2, which is even.
    - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
    - The condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    - The `elif` block is executed, and `even_palindrome_count` becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    - The value of `i` is 3, which is odd.
    - The condition `i % 2 == 1` is true.
    - The condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    - The `elif` block is not executed.
    - The `else` block is executed, and `odd_palindrome_count` becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    - The value of `i` is 4, which is even.
    - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
    - The condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    - The `elif` block is executed, and `even_palindrome_count` becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    - The value of `i` is 5, which is odd.
    - The condition `i % 2 == 1` is true.
    - The condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    - The `elif` block is not executed.
    - The `else` block is executed, and `odd_palindrome_count` becomes 3.
Iteration 6:
    - The value of `i` is 6, which is even.
    - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
    - The condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    - The `elif` block is executed, and `even_palindrome_count` becomes 3.
Iteration 7:
    - The value of `i` is 7, which is odd.
    - The condition `i % 2 == 1` is true.
    - The condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    - The `elif` block is not executed.
    - The `else` block is executed, and `odd_palindrome_count` becomes 4.
Iteration 8:
    - The value of `i` is 8, which is even.
    - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
    - The condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    - The `elif` block is executed, and `even_palindrome_count` becomes 4.
Iteration 9:
    - The value of `i` is 9, which is odd.
    - The condition `i % 2 == 1` is true.
    - The condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    - The `elif` block is not executed.
    - The `else` block is executed, and `odd_palindrome_count` becomes 5.

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_palindrome(9)` is (0, 0).
