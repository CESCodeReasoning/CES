The function `median` is called with ( l = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5] ).
The list `l` is sorted, resulting in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The length of the list is 5, which is odd.
The if branch is taken, and the middle element of the list is returned, which is 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])` is 3.
