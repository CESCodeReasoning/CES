The function add takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the even-indexed elements.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 4, 6, 8], we need to calculate the sum of the even-indexed elements.
The even-indexed elements are 4, 6, and 8, so the sum is 4 + 6 + 8 = 18.
Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 4, 6, 8] is 18.
