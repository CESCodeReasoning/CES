The function `pluck` is called with ( arr = [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2] ).
The condition `len(arr) == 0` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken and the method proceeds to the next line.
The list comprehension `evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, arr))` creates a new list with all the even numbers from `arr`.
The condition `evens == []` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken and the method proceeds to the next line.
The method returns the list `[min(evens), arr.index(min(evens))]` which is `[0, 1]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])` is `[0, 1]`.
