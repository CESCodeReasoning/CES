The function `intersection` is called with ( interval1 = [-2, -2] ) and ( interval2 = [-3, -2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the maximum of `interval1[0]` and `interval2[0]`, which is -2.
A variable `r` is initialized to the minimum of `interval1[1]` and `interval2[1]`, which is -2.
A variable `length` is initialized to `r - l`, which is 0.

The function `is_prime` is called with ( num = 0 ).
Inside the function, the condition `num == 1 or num == 0` is true, so the function returns False.

The condition `length > 0 and is_prime(length)` is false, so the function returns "NO".
