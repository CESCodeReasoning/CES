The function `is_sorted` is called with ( lst = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `count_digit` is initialized with the keys as the elements of the list and the values as 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 3 (since ( len(lst) = 4 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit[1]` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit[2]` to 1 ( 1 + 1 = 2 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit[3]` to 1 ( 2 + 1 = 3 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
    `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit[4]` to 1 ( 3 + 1 = 4 ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst) ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `False` as the output.
