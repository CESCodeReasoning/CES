The function `split_words` is called with ( txt = "" ).
The first condition `(" " in txt)` is False.
The first branch is not taken.
The second condition `"," in txt` is False.
The second branch is not taken.
The third branch is taken.
The function returns the length of the list comprehension `[i for i in txt if i.islower() and ord(i) % 2 == 0]`.
Since the list comprehension is empty, the length is 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `split_words("")` is 0.
