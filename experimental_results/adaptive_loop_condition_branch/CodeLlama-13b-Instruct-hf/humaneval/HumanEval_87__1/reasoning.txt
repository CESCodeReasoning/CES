The function get_row takes a 2D list lst and an integer x as input.
It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the coordinates of the elements in lst that are equal to x.
The coordinates are sorted first by the column index (i.e., the second element of the tuple) in descending order, and then by the row index (i.e., the first element of the tuple) in ascending order.

To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input ([[]], [1], [1, 2, 3]), we need to find the coordinates of the elements in the list that are equal to 3.
There are no elements in the list that are equal to 3, so the output is an empty list.
