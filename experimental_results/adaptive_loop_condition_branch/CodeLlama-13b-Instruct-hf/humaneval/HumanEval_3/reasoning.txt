The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -3, 1, 2, -3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `op` is 1, `balance` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - `op` is 2, `balance` becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    - `op` is -3, `balance` becomes 0.
Iteration 4:
    - `op` is 1, `balance` becomes 1.
Iteration 5:
    - `op` is 2, `balance` becomes 3.
Iteration 6:
    - `op` is -3, `balance` becomes 0.
