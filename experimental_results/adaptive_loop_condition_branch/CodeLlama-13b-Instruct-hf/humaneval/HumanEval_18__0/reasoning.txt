The function `how_many_times` is called with ( string = 'xyxyxyx', substring = 'x' ).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The substring 'x' is not found in the string 'xyxyxyx'.
Iteration 2:
    - The substring 'x' is found at index 1 in the string 'xyxyxyx'.
Iteration 3:
    - The substring 'x' is not found in the string 'xyxyxyx'.
Iteration 4:
    - The substring 'x' is found at index 3 in the string 'xyxyxyx'.
Iteration 5:
    - The substring 'x' is not found in the string 'xyxyxyx'.
Iteration 6:
    - The substring 'x' is found at index 5 in the string 'xyxyxyx'.
Iteration 7:
    - The substring 'x' is not found in the string 'xyxyxyx'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `how_many_times('xyxyxyx', 'x')` is 3.
