The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Wow' ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the length of the input string, which is 3.

First Condition:
    - The length of the input string is 3, which satisfies the condition `l == 0 or l == 1`.
    - The condition `l == 0` is false, and the condition `l == 1` is false.
    - Therefore, the first condition is false, and the function returns `False`.

Second Condition:
    - The length of the input string is 3, which satisfies the condition `l == 0 or l == 1`.
    - The condition `l == 0` is false, and the condition `l == 1` is false.
    - Therefore, the second condition is false, and the function returns `False`.

Third Condition:
    - The length of the input string is 3, which satisfies the condition `l == 0 or l == 1`.
    - The condition `l == 0` is false, and the condition `l == 1` is false.
    - Therefore, the third condition is false, and the function returns `False`.

Fourth Condition:
    - The length of the input string is 3, which satisfies the condition `l == 0 or l == 1`.
    - The condition `l == 0` is false, and the condition `l == 1` is false.
    - Therefore, the fourth condition is false, and the function returns `False`.

Fifth Condition:
    - The length of the input string is 3, which satisfies the condition `l == 0 or l == 1`.
    - The condition `l == 0` is false, and the condition `l == 1` is false.
    - Therefore, the fifth condition is false, and the function returns `False`.

Sixth Condition:
    - The length of the input string is 3, which satisfies the condition `l == 0 or l == 1`.
    - The condition `l == 0` is false, and the condition `l == 1` is false.
    - Therefore, the sixth condition is false, and the function returns `False`.

Seventh Condition:
    - The length of the input string is 3, which satisfies the condition `l == 0 or l == 1`.
    - The condition `l == 0` is false, and the condition `l == 1` is false.
    - Therefore, the seventh condition is false, and the function returns `False`.

Eighth Condition:
    - The length of the input string is 3, which satisfies the condition `l == 0 or l == 1`.
    - The condition `l == 0` is false, and the condition `l == 1` is false.
    - Therefore, the eighth condition is false, and the function returns `False`.

Ninth Condition:
    - The length of the input string is 3, which satisfies the condition `l == 0 or l == 1`.
    - The condition `l == 0` is false, and the condition `l == 1` is false.
    - Therefore, the ninth condition is false, and the function returns `False`.

Tenth Condition:
    - The length of the input string is 3, which satisfies the condition `l == 0 or l == 1`.
    - The condition `l == 0` is false, and the condition `l == 1` is false.
    - Therefore, the tenth condition is false, and the function returns `False`.

Eleventh Condition:
    - The length of the input string is 3, which satisfies the condition `l == 0 or l == 1`.
    - The condition `l == 0` is false, and the condition `l == 1` is false.
    - Therefore, the eleventh condition is false, and the function returns `False`.

Twelfth Condition:
    - The length of the input string is 3, which satisfies the condition `l == 0 or l == 1`.
    - The condition `l == 0` is false, and the condition `l == 1` is false.
    - Therefore, the twelfth condition is false, and the function returns `False`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `prime_length('Wow')` is `False`.
