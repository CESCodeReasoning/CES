The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['(()(())', '())())'] ).
Inside the function, a nested function `check` is defined.

The function `check` takes a string `s` as input.
It initializes a variable `val` to 0.

The loop iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`.
For each iteration, the following actions are performed:

1. If `i` is '(', then `val` is incremented by 1.
2. If `i` is ')', then `val` is decremented by 1.
3. If `val` is less than 0, then the function returns `False`.

After the loop completes, the function returns `True` if `val` is 0, and `False` otherwise.

The function `match_parens` concatenates the two strings in `lst` and passes them to the function `check`.
If the function `check` returns `True`, then the function `match_parens` returns `'Yes'`.
Otherwise, it returns `'No'`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `match_parens(['(()(())', '())())'])` is `'Yes'`.
