The function `count_upper` is called with ( s = 'aBCdEf' ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 4 (since ( len(s) = 6 ) and ( step = 2 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is not in the string 'aBCdEf'.
Second Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which is 'B', which is in the string 'aBCdEf'.
   - The condition `s[i] in "AEIOU"` is true.
   - Action: `count += 1` updates `count` to 1.
Third Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which is 'E', which is in the string 'aBCdEf'.
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `count += 1` updates `count` to 2.
