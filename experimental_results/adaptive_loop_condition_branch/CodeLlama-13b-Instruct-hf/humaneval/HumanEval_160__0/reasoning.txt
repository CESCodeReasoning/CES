The function `do_algebra` is called with (operator = ['//', '*'] ) and (operand = [7, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `expression` is initialized to '7'.
`zip(operator, operand[1:])` = zip(['//', '*'], [3, 4]) = [('//', 3), ('*', 4)]
The loop iterates through the elements of the list `zip(operator, operand[1:])`.

First Iteration(oprt = '//', oprn = 3):
    expression = '7//3'
Second Iteration(oprt = '*', oprn = 4):
    expression = '7//3*4'
