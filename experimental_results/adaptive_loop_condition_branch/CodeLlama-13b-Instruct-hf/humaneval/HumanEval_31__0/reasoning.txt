The function `is_prime` is called with ( n = 5 * 17 = 34 ).
Inside the function, the first condition `n < 2` is false, so the function proceeds to the next line.
The loop iterates from 2 through 16 (since ( n - 1 = 34 - 1 = 33 )).
First Iteration (k = 2)
   - `k` is 2, which is not divisible by `n` (34).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Second Iteration (k = 3)
   - `k` is 3, which is not divisible by `n` (34).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Third Iteration (k = 4)
   - `k` is 4, which is not divisible by `n` (34).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Fourth Iteration (k = 5)
   - `k` is 5, which is not divisible by `n` (34).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Fifth Iteration (k = 6)
   - `k` is 6, which is not divisible by `n` (34).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Sixth Iteration (k = 7)
   - `k` is 7, which is not divisible by `n` (34).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Seventh Iteration (k = 8)
   - `k` is 8, which is not divisible by `n` (34).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Eighth Iteration (k = 9)
   - `k` is 9, which is not divisible by `n` (34).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Ninth Iteration (k = 10)
   - `k` is 10, which is not divisible by `n` (34).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Tenth Iteration (k = 11)
   - `k` is 11, which is not divisible by `n` (34).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Eleventh Iteration (k = 12)
   - `k` is 12, which is not divisible by `n` (34).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Twelfth Iteration (k = 13)
   - `k` is 13, which is not divisible by `n` (34).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Thirteenth Iteration (k = 14)
   - `k` is 14, which is not divisible by `n` (34).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Fourteenth Iteration (k = 15)
   - `k` is 15, which is not divisible by `n` (34).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Fifteenth Iteration (k = 16)
   - `k` is 16, which is not divisible by `n` (34).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Since none of the iterations resulted in `return False`, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_prime(5 * 17)` is `True`.
