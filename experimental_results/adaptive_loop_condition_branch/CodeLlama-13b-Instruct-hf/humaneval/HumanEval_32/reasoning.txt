The function `find_zero` is called with a list of coefficients `xs`.
The function first initializes `begin` and `end` to -1 and 1, respectively.
The function then enters a loop that iterates until `poly(xs, begin) * poly(xs, end) <= 0`.
Inside the loop, the function multiplies `begin` and `end` by 2 and checks if `poly(xs, begin) * poly(xs, end) > 0`.
If the condition is true, the function updates `begin` to `center` and `end` to `center`.
If the condition is false, the function updates `end` to `center`.
The loop continues until `end - begin <= 1e-10`.
After the loop completes, the function returns `begin`.
