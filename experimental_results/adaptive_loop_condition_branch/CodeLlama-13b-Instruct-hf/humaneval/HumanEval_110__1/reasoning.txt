The function `exchange` is called with ( lst1 = [100, 200], lst2 = [200, 200] ).
Inside the function, two variables `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The first element of `lst1` is 100, which is odd.
    - The first element of `lst2` is 200, which is even.
Iteration 2:
    - The second element of `lst1` is 200, which is even.
    - The second element of `lst2` is 200, which is even.

Since `even` is greater than or equal to `odd`, the function returns "YES".
