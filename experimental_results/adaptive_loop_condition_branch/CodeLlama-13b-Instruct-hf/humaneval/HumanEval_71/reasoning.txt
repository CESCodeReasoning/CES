The function `triangle_area` is called with ( a = 3, b = 4, c = 5 ).
The condition `a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The function calculates the area of the triangle using the Heron's formula and returns the result.

Therefore, the final output of the function `triangle_area(3, 4, 5)` is 6.0.
