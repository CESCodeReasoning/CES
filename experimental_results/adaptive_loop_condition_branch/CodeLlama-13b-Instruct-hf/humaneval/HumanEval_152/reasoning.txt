The function compare takes two lists as input, game and guess, and returns a list of absolute differences between the corresponding elements of the two lists.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input [1,2,3,4,5,1] and [1,2,3,4,2,-2], we need to iterate through the two lists and calculate the absolute difference between the corresponding elements.
Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input [1,2,3,4,5,1] and [1,2,3,4,2,-2] is [0,0,0,0,1,1].
