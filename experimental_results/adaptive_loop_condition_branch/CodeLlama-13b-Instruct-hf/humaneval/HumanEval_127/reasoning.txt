The function `intersection` is called with ( interval1 = (1, 2) ) and ( interval2 = (2, 3) ).
Inside the function, a nested function `is_prime` is defined.

The function `is_prime` is called with ( num = 2 ).
The function checks if `num` is equal to 1 or 0, which is not the case.
The function checks if `num` is equal to 2, which is true.
The function returns `True`.

The function `intersection` checks if the length of the intersection of the two intervals is greater than 0 and if the length is prime.
The length of the intersection is 1.
The function `is_prime` is called with ( length = 1 ).
The function checks if `length` is equal to 1 or 0, which is true.
The function checks if `length` is equal to 2, which is not the case.
The function returns `False`.

Therefore, the output of the function `intersection` is "NO".
