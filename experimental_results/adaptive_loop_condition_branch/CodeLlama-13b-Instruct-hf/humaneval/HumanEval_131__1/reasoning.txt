The function `digits` is called with ( n = 5576543 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1.
A variable `odd_count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The character '5' is not odd, so the `product` remains 1.
    - The `odd_count` is incremented to 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The character '5' is not odd, so the `product` remains 1.
    - The `odd_count` is incremented to 2.
Iteration 3:
    - The character '7' is odd, so the `product` becomes 7.
    - The `odd_count` is incremented to 3.
Iteration 4:
    - The character '6' is not odd, so the `product` remains 7.
    - The `odd_count` is incremented to 4.
Iteration 5:
    - The character '5' is not odd, so the `product` remains 7.
    - The `odd_count` is incremented to 5.
Iteration 6:
    - The character '4' is not odd, so the `product` remains 7.
    - The `odd_count` is incremented to 6.
Iteration 7:
    - The character '3' is odd, so the `product` becomes 21.
    - The `odd_count` is incremented to 7.

Since the `odd_count` is not 0, the function returns the value of `product`, which is 21.
