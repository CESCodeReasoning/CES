<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    return a * a == b * b + c * c or b * b == a * a + c * c or c * c == a * a + b * b
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
right_angle_triangle(1, 1, 1)
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [PYTHON]
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    return a * a == b * b + c * c or b * b == a * a + c * c or c * c == a * a + b * b
[/PYTHON]

[TESTS]
# Test case 1:
assert right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
# Test case 2:
assert right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 6) == False
# Test case 3:
assert right_angle_triangle(3, 5, 4) == True
# Test case 4:
assert right_angle_triangle(4, 3, 5) == True
# Test case 5:
assert right_angle_triangle(4, 5, 3) == False
# Test case 6:
assert right_angle_triangle(5, 3, 4) == True
# Test case 7:
assert right_angle_triangle(5, 4, 3) == False
