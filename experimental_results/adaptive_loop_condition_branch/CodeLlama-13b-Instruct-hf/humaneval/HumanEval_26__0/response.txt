<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    import collections
    c = collections.Counter(numbers)
    return [n for n in numbers if c[n] <= 1]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 4])
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [PYTHON]
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    import collections
    c = collections.Counter(numbers)
    return [n for n in numbers if c[n] <= 1]
[/PYTHON]

[TESTS]
# Test case 1:
assert remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Test case 2:
assert remove_duplicates([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Test case 3:
assert remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
