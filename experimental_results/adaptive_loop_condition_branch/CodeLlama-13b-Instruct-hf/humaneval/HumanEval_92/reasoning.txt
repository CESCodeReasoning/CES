The function `any_int` is called with ( x = 2, y = 3, z = 1 ).
All three arguments are integers, which satisfies (isinstance(x,int) and isinstance(y,int) and isinstance(z,int)).
The if branch is taken.
The condition (x+y==z) is True, since (2+3==1).
The condition (x+z==y) is False, since (2+1!=3).
The condition (y+z==x) is False, since (3+1!=2).
The or operator is used, and at least one of the conditions is True, so the if branch is taken.
The function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `any_int(2, 3, 1)` is True.
