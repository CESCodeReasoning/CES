The function triangle_area takes two arguments, a and h, and returns the area of a triangle with base a and height h.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (2, 2), we need to calculate the area of a triangle with base 2 and height 2.
The formula for the area of a triangle is A = (base x height) / 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (2, 2) is (2 x 2) / 2 = 1.
