The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "(" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The character '(' is encountered, so `depth` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The character ')' is encountered, so `depth` becomes 0.
Since `depth` is not equal to 0, the function returns `False`.
