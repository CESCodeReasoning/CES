The function `Strongest_Extension` is called with ( class_name = 'Watashi', extensions = ['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `strong` is initialized to the first element of `extensions`, which is 'tEN'.
A variable `my_val` is initialized to the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in `strong`.

Iteration 1:
    - `s` is 'tEN', `val` is 0 (since there are no uppercase letters).
    - `my_val` is still 0.
Iteration 2:
    - `s` is 'niNE', `val` is 0 (since there are no uppercase letters).
    - `my_val` is still 0.
Iteration 3:
    - `s` is 'eIGHt8OKe', `val` is 1 (since there is one uppercase letter).
    - `my_val` is updated to 1.
    - `strong` is updated to 'eIGHt8OKe'.

The final output of the function `Strongest_Extension('Watashi', ['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe'])` is 'Watashi.eIGHt8OKe'.
