The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['())(', '()'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `S1` and `S2` are initialized to the concatenation of the first and second elements of `lst` respectively.

The function `check` is called with `S1` as an argument.
Inside the function, a variable `val` is initialized to 0.

The loop iterates through the characters of `S1`.
First Iteration (i = '('):
   - `i` is '(', which satisfies ( i == '(' ).
   - The condition `i == '('` is true.
   - Action: `val` becomes 1 (`val = val + 1`).
Second Iteration (i = ')'):
   - `i` is ')', which does not satisfy ( i == '(' ).
   - The condition `i == '('` is false.
   - Action: `val` becomes 0 (`val = val - 1`).
Third Iteration (i = '('):
   - `i` is '(', which satisfies ( i == '(' ).
   - The condition `i == '('` is true.
   - Action: `val` becomes 1 (`val = val + 1`).
Fourth Iteration (i = ')'):
   - `i` is ')', which does not satisfy ( i == '(' ).
   - The condition `i == '('` is false.
   - Action: `val` becomes 0 (`val = val - 1`).
Fifth Iteration (i = '('):
   - `i` is '(', which satisfies ( i == '(' ).
   - The condition `i == '('` is true.
   - Action: `val` becomes 1 (`val = val + 1`).
Sixth Iteration (i = ')'):
   - `i` is ')', which does not satisfy ( i == '(' ).
   - The condition `i == '('` is false.
   - Action: `val` becomes 0 (`val = val - 1`).
Seventh Iteration (i = ')'):
   - `i` is ')', which does not satisfy ( i == '(' ).
   - The condition `i == '('` is false.
   - Action: `val` becomes -1 (`val = val - 1`).

The loop completes, and the function `check` returns `False` since `val` is less than 0.

The function `match_parens` returns `'Yes'` since `check(S1)` is `False` and `check(S2)` is `True`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `match_parens(['())(', '()'])` is `'Yes'`.
