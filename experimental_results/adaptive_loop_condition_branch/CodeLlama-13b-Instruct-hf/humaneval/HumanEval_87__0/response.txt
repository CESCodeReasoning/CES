<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def get_row(lst, x):
    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst))
              for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
    return sorted(
        sorted(
            coords,
            key=lambda x: x[1],
            reverse=True),
        key=lambda x: x[0])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
get_row([[1]], 2)
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [PYTHON]
def get_row(lst, x):
    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst)) for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
    return sorted(sorted(coords, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True), key=lambda x: x[0])
[/PYTHON]

[REASONING]
The function get_row takes a 2D list lst and an integer x as input.
It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the coordinates of the elements in lst that are equal to x.
The coordinates are sorted first by the column index (j) in descending order, and then by the row index (i) in ascending order.

To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input ([[1]], 2), we need to find the coordinates of the elements in the 2D list that are equal to 2.
Since there are no elements in the 2D list that are equal to 2, the output of the function is an empty list.
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
