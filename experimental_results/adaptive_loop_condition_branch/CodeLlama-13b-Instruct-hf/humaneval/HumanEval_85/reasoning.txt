The function add takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the even-indexed elements.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88], we need to calculate the sum of the even-indexed elements.
The even-indexed elements of the list [4, 88] are 88, which is even.
Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88] is 88.
