The function incr_list takes a list l as input and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1.
To determine the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], we need to increment each element in the list by 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123] is [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124].
