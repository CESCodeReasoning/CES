<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def incr_list(l: list):
    return [(e + 1) for e in l]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
incr_list([5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [PYTHON]
def incr_list(l: list):
    return [(e + 1) for e in l]
[/PYTHON]

[TESTS]
# Test case 1:
assert incr_list([]) == []
# Test case 2:
assert incr_list([1]) == [2]
# Test case 3:
assert incr_list([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 3, 4]
[/TESTS]

[REASONING]
The function incr_list takes a list l as input and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1.
To determine the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], we need to increment each element in the list by 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123] is [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124].
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
[/OUTPUT]</s>
