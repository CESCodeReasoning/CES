The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of every third element of the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to sort every third element of the input list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 3, 2].
