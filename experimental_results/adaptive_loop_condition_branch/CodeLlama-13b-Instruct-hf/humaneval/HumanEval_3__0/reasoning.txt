The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -4, 5, 6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `op` is 1, `balance` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - `op` is 2, `balance` becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    - `op` is -4, `balance` becomes -1.
    - The condition `balance < 0` is true, so the function returns `True`.
