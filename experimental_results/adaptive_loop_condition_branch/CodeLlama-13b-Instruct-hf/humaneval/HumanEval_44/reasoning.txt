The function `change_base` is called with ( x = 8, base = 3 ).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to an empty string.
First Iteration:
    - x = 8, x % base = 2, x //= base = 2.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "2".
Second Iteration:
    - x = 2, x % base = 2, x //= base = 0.
    - `ret = str(x % base) + ret` updates `ret` to "22".
The while loop terminates, the function returns the value of `ret`, which is now "22".
