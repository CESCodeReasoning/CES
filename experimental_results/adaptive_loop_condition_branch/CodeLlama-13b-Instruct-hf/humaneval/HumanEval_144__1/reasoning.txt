The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "5/1", n = "3/1" ).
`x` is "5/1", which is a string.
`n` is "3/1", which is also a string.
The function splits `x` and `n` into two strings, `a` and `b`, and `c` and `d`, respectively.
`a` is "5", `b` is "1", `c` is "3", and `d` is "1".
The function calculates the numerator and denominator of the fraction.
The numerator is `a` multiplied by `c`, which is 5 multiplied by 3, which is 15.
The denominator is `b` multiplied by `d`, which is 1 multiplied by 1, which is 1.
The function checks if the numerator divided by the denominator is equal to the integer part of the result.
The result of the division is 15 divided by 1, which is 15.
The integer part of the result is 15.
The condition `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns True

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("5/1", "3/1")` is True.
