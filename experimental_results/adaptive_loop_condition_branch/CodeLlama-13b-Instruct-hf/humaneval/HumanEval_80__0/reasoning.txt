The function `is_happy` is called with ( s = "aabb" ).
The length of the string is 4, which is greater than 3.
The loop iterates from 0 to 2 (since ( len(s) - 2 ) = 2).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `s[i]` is "a", `s[i + 1]` is "a", `s[i + 2]` is "b".
   - The condition `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]` is false.
   - The `return False` statement is not executed.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `s[i]` is "a", `s[i + 1]` is "b", `s[i + 2]` is "b".
   - The condition is still false.
   - The `return False` statement is not executed.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `s[i]` is "b", `s[i + 1]` is "b", `s[i + 2]` is "a".
   - The condition is still false.
   - The `return False` statement is not executed.
Since the loop completes without executing the `return False` statement, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_happy("aabb")` is `False`.
