The function is_bored takes a string S as input and returns the number of sentences in S that start with "I ".
To determine the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "You and I are going for a walk", we need to split the string into sentences using the regular expression r'[.?!]\s*'.
This will give us a list of sentences, where each sentence is a substring of the original string.
Next, we need to count the number of sentences in the list that start with "I ".
To do this, we can use a list comprehension to iterate over the list of sentences and check if each sentence starts with "I ".
If a sentence starts with "I ", we add 1 to the count.
Finally, we return the count.
