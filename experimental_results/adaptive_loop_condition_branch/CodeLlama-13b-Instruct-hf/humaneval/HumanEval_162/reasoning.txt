The function string_to_md5 takes a string text as input and returns the MD5 hash of the text.
To determine the output of executing the function string_to_md5 on the input "Hello world", we need to first encode the string "Hello world" to ASCII and then calculate the MD5 hash of the encoded string.
The MD5 hash of the encoded string is then returned as the output of the function.
