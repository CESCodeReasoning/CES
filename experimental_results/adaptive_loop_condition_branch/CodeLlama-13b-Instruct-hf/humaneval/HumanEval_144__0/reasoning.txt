The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "2/4" ) and ( n = "8/4" ).
The function splits the input strings into two parts, `a` and `b`, and `c` and `d`, respectively.
The numerator is calculated as `int(a) * int(c)`, and the denominator is calculated as `int(b) * int(d)`.
The condition `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` is evaluated, which is true since `numerator` and `denom` are both integers.
Therefore, the if branch is taken and the method returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("2/4", "8/4")` is True.
