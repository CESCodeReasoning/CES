The function `get_odd_collatz` is called with ( n = 14 ).
The first condition `n%2==0` is false, so the first branch is not taken.
The second branch is taken, and the variable `odd_collatz` is initialized to [14].
The loop iterates from 14 through 1 (since ( n = 14 )).
First Iteration (n = 14):
    - n > 1 when n=14
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `n = n/2` updates n to 7 ( 14 / 2 = 7 ).
Second Iteration (n = 7):
    - n > 1 when n=7
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `n = n/2` updates n to 3 ( 7 / 2 = 3 ).
Third Iteration (n = 3):
    - n > 1 when n=3
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `n = n/2` updates n to 1 ( 3 / 2 = 1 ).
Fourth Iteration (n = 1):
    - n > 1 when n=1
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `n%2 == 1` is true. The second branch is taken.
    - `odd_collatz.append(int(n))` updates `odd_collatz` to [14, 7, 3] ( [14] + [7, 3] = [14, 7, 3] ).
Fifth Iteration (n = 1):
    - n > 1 when n=1
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `n%2 == 1` is true. The second branch is taken.
    - `odd_collatz.append(int(n))` updates `odd_collatz` to [14, 7, 3, 1] ( [14, 7, 3] + [1] = [14, 7, 3, 1] ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `odd_collatz`, which is now [14, 7, 3, 1].
