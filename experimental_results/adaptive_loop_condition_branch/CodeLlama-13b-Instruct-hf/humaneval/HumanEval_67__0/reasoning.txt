The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "2 apples and 3 oranges", n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a list `lis` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates through the string `s` split by spaces.
First Iteration (i = "2"):
   - `i` is "2", which is a digit.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is true.
   - Action: `lis.append(int(i))` appends the integer value of "2" to `lis`.
Second Iteration (i = "apples"):
   - `i` is "apples", which is not a digit.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Third Iteration (i = "and"):
   - `i` is "and", which is not a digit.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Fourth Iteration (i = "3"):
   - `i` is "3", which is a digit.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is true.
   - Action: `lis.append(int(i))` appends the integer value of "3" to `lis`.
Fifth Iteration (i = "oranges"):
   - `i` is "oranges", which is not a digit.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - No action is taken.
After the loop completes, the function returns `n - sum(lis)`, which is 5 - (2 + 3) = 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 5)` is 0.
