<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def unique(l: list):
    return sorted(list(set(l)))
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [PYTHON]
def unique(l: list):
    return sorted(list(set(l)))
[/PYTHON]

[TESTS]
# Test case 1:
assert unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
# Test case 2:
assert unique([]) == []
# Test case 3:
assert unique([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[/TESTS]

[REASONING]
The function unique takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of unique elements from l.
To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], we need to first convert the list to a set to remove duplicates.
Then, we sort the set and convert it back to a list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123] is [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123].
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
[/OUTPUT]</s>
