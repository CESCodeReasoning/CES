The function strlen takes a string as input and returns its length.
To determine the output of executing the function strlen on the input 'x', we need to determine the length of the string 'x'.
The length of the string 'x' is 1, since it contains only one character.
Therefore, the output of executing the function strlen on the input 'x' is 1.
