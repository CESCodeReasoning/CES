The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a list of floating-point numbers that have been rescaled to the unit interval [0, 1].
To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9], we need to first determine the minimum and maximum values in the input list.
The minimum value is 2.0, and the maximum value is 49.9.
Next, we need to subtract the minimum value from each element in the input list and divide the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
Therefore, the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9] is [(2.0 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0), (49.9 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0)] = [0.0, 1.0].
