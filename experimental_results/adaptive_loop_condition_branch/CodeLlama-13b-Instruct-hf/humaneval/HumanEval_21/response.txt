<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    min_number = min(numbers)
    max_number = max(numbers)
    return [(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number) for x in numbers]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
rescale_to_unit([2.0, 49.9]) 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [REASONING]
The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a list of floating-point numbers that have been rescaled to the unit interval [0, 1].
To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9], we need to first determine the minimum and maximum values in the input list.
The minimum value is 2.0, and the maximum value is 49.9.
Next, we need to subtract the minimum value from each element in the input list and divide the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
Therefore, the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9] is [(2.0 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0), (49.9 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0)] = [0.0, 1.0].
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[0.0, 1.0]
[/OUTPUT]</s>
