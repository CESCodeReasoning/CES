The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The value of `i` is 1.
    - The condition `i % 2 == 1` is false, so the `elif` block is not executed.
    - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is also false, so the `else` block is not executed.
    - The function returns the value of `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count`, which are both 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_palindrome(1)` is (0, 0).
