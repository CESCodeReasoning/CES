The function triangle_area takes two arguments, a and h, and returns the area of a triangle with base a and height h.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (10, 8), we need to calculate the area of the triangle.
The formula for the area of a triangle is A = (base \* height) / 2.0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (10, 8) is (10 \* 8) / 2.0 = 40.0.
