The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'a b c d g' ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `dict1` is initialized to an empty dictionary.
A list `list1` is created by splitting the input string `test` on spaces.
A variable `t` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The first element of `list1` is 'a', which is not empty.
    - The count of 'a' in `list1` is 1, which is greater than `t`.
    - `t` is updated to 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The second element of `list1` is 'b', which is not empty.
    - The count of 'b' in `list1` is 1, which is greater than `t`.
    - `t` is updated to 1.
Iteration 3:
    - The third element of `list1` is 'c', which is not empty.
    - The count of 'c' in `list1` is 1, which is greater than `t`.
    - `t` is updated to 1.
Iteration 4:
    - The fourth element of `list1` is 'd', which is not empty.
    - The count of 'd' in `list1` is 1, which is greater than `t`.
    - `t` is updated to 1.
Iteration 5:
    - The fifth element of `list1` is 'g', which is not empty.
    - The count of 'g' in `list1` is 1, which is greater than `t`.
    - `t` is updated to 1.

Since `t` is greater than 0, the `if` statement is executed.

Iteration 1:
    - The first element of `list1` is 'a', which has a count of 1, which is equal to `t`.
    - The key-value pair ('a', 1) is added to `dict1`.
Iteration 2:
    - The second element of `list1` is 'b', which has a count of 1, which is equal to `t`.
    - The key-value pair ('b', 1) is added to `dict1`.
Iteration 3:
    - The third element of `list1` is 'c', which has a count of 1, which is equal to `t`.
    - The key-value pair ('c', 1) is added to `dict1`.
Iteration 4:
    - The fourth element of `list1` is 'd', which has a count of 1, which is equal to `t`.
    - The key-value pair ('d', 1) is added to `dict1`.
Iteration 5:
    - The fifth element of `list1` is 'g', which has a count of 1, which is equal to `t`.
    - The key-value pair ('g', 1) is added to `dict1`.

The function returns `dict1`, which contains the key-value pairs ('a', 1), ('b', 1), ('c', 1), ('d', 1), ('g', 1).

Therefore, the final output of the function `histogram('a b c d g')` is {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1, 'd': 1, 'g': 1}.
