The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [1, 2, 3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates through the list `lst` with `i` taking on the values 0, 1, and 2.
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 % 3 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` results in `result` becoming [1].
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which does not satisfy ( 1 % 3 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i])` results in `result` becoming [1, 2].
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which does not satisfy ( 2 % 3 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i])` results in `result` becoming [1, 2, 3].
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `sum(result)`, which is 14.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_squares([1, 2, 3])` is 14.
