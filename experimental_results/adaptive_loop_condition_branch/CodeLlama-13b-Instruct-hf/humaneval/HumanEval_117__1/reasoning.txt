The function select_words(s, n) takes a string s and an integer n as its parameters.
The function first splits the string s into a list of words using the split() method.
The outer loop iterates through each word in the list.
In the inner loop, for each word indexed by i in the outer loop, iterate through each character in the word.
If the character is not a vowel, increment a counter.
If the counter is equal to n, append the word to the result list.
