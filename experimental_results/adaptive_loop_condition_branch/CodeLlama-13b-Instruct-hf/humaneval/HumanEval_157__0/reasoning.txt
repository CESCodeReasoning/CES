The function right_angle_triangle takes three integers a, b, and c as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the triangle formed by the sides of length a, b, and c is a right triangle.
To determine the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input (7, 24, 25), we need to check whether the triangle is a right triangle.
A right triangle has one angle that is 90 degrees. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to check whether the triangle is a right triangle.
The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
In this case, we can check whether the triangle is a right triangle by checking whether the square of the length of the hypotenuse (25) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (7 and 24).
We can calculate the square of the length of the hypotenuse as follows:
25^2 = 625
We can calculate the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides as follows:
7^2 + 24^2 = 49 + 576 = 625
Therefore, the triangle formed by the sides of length 7, 24, and 25 is a right triangle.
