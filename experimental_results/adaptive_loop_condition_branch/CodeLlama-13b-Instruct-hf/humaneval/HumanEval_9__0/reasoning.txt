The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [4, 3, 2, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None.
The loop iterates through the list of numbers.
First Iteration (n = 4)
   - `running_max` is None, so the condition `running_max is None` is true.
   - The action `running_max = n` sets `running_max` to 4.
   - The result list is updated with `running_max`, which is 4.
Second Iteration (n = 3)
   - `running_max` is 4, so the condition `running_max is None` is false.
   - The action `running_max = max(running_max, n)` sets `running_max` to 4 (since 4 is greater than 3).
   - The result list is updated with `running_max`, which is 4.
Third Iteration (n = 2)
   - `running_max` is 4, so the condition `running_max is None` is false.
   - The action `running_max = max(running_max, n)` sets `running_max` to 4 (since 4 is greater than 2).
   - The result list is updated with `running_max`, which is 4.
Fourth Iteration (n = 1)
   - `running_max` is 4, so the condition `running_max is None` is false.
   - The action `running_max = max(running_max, n)` sets `running_max` to 4 (since 4 is greater than 1).
   - The result list is updated with `running_max`, which is 4.
Therefore, the final output of the function `rolling_max([4, 3, 2, 1])` is [4, 4, 4, 4].
