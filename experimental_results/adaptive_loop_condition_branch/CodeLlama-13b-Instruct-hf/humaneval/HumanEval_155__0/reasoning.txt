The function `even_odd_count` is called with ( num = -345821 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_count` and `odd_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The character '3' is not even, so `odd_count` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The character '4' is even, so `even_count` becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    - The character '5' is not even, so `odd_count` becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    - The character '8' is even, so `even_count` becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    - The character '2' is even, so `even_count` becomes 3.
Iteration 6:
    - The character '1' is not even, so `odd_count` becomes 3.
