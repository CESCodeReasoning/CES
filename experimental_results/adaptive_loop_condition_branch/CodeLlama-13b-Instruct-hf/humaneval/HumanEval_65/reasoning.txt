The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 100, shift = 2 ).
`x` is 100, which is a string representation of an integer.
`shift` is 2, which is a positive integer.
The condition `shift > len(s)` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
The method returns the concatenation of the last `shift` characters of `s` and the first `len(s) - shift` characters of `s`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(100, 2)` is "00".
