The function `strange_sort_list` is called with ( lst = [111111] ).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
A variable `switch` is initialized to `True`.
The while loop iterates until `lst` is empty.
First Iteration:
    - `lst` = [111111], `min(lst)` = 111111, `max(lst)` = 111111.
    - `res.append(min(lst) if switch else max(lst))` updates `res` to [111111].
    - `lst.remove(res[-1])` updates `lst` to [].
    - `switch` is updated to `not switch`, which is `False`.
The while loop terminates, and the function returns the value of `res`, which is now [111111].
