The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `s` is 0 - 2 = -2.
    - `s` is less than 0, so `s` is set to 0.
    - `max_sum` is updated to 0.
Iteration 2:
    - `s` is 0 - 3 = -3.
    - `s` is less than 0, so `s` is set to 0.
    - `max_sum` is updated to 0.
Iteration 3:
    - `s` is 0 - 4 = -4.
    - `s` is less than 0, so `s` is set to 0.
    - `max_sum` is updated to 0.
Iteration 4:
    - `s` is 0 - 1 = -1.
    - `s` is greater than 0, so `s` is not set to 0.
    - `max_sum` is updated to -1.
Iteration 5:
    - `s` is -1 - 2 = -3.
    - `s` is less than 0, so `s` is set to 0.
    - `max_sum` is updated to 0.
Iteration 6:
    - `s` is 0 - 4 = -4.
    - `s` is less than 0, so `s` is set to 0.
    - `max_sum` is updated to 0.

The final value of `max_sum` is 0, so the function returns -0.
