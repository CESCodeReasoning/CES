The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [12345, 2033, 111, 151] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_digit_elements` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    - The element `12345` is not an odd number, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 2:
    - The element `2033` is an odd number, so it is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 3:
    - The element `111` is an odd number, so it is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 4:
    - The element `151` is not an odd number, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.

The function returns the sorted list of odd digit elements, which is [111, 2033].
