The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "123456789ABCDEF0" ).
Inside the function, a variable `primes` is initialized to a tuple of prime numbers.
The loop iterates from 0 through 11 (since ( len(num) = 12 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is not in `primes`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which is not in `primes`.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which is not in `primes`.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which is not in `primes`.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which is not in `primes`.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which is not in `primes`.
Seventh Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is 6, which is not in `primes`.
Eighth Iteration (i = 7)
   - `i` is 7, which is not in `primes`.
Ninth Iteration (i = 8)
   - `i` is 8, which is not in `primes`.
Tenth Iteration (i = 9)
   - `i` is 9, which is not in `primes`.
Eleventh Iteration (i = 10)
   - `i` is 10, which is not in `primes`.
Twelfth Iteration (i = 11)
   - `i` is 11, which is not in `primes`.
Since none of the characters in `num` are in `primes`, the loop completes without updating `total`.
Therefore, the final output of the function `hex_key("123456789ABCDEF0")` is 0.
