The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [5, -2, 1, -5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `num` is 5, which is not greater than 10.
Iteration 2:
    - `num` is -2, which is not greater than 10.
Iteration 3:
    - `num` is 1, which is not greater than 10.
Iteration 4:
    - `num` is -5, which is not greater than 10.

Since none of the numbers in the list are greater than 10, the `if` statement is never executed, and `count` remains 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `specialFilter([5, -2, 1, -5])` is 0.
