The function find_max takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "of", "string"], we need to sort the list of strings based on the length of the unique characters in each string.
The sorted function is used with the key parameter set to a lambda function that takes a string x and returns a tuple containing the length of the unique characters in x and x itself.
The sorted function then sorts the list of strings based on the first element of the tuple, which is the length of the unique characters in each string.
The first element of the sorted list is then returned as the output of the function.
