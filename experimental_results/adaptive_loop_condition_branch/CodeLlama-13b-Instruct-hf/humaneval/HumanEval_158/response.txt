<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def find_max(words):
    return sorted(words, key = lambda x: (-len(set(x)), x))[0]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
find_max(["name", "of", "string"])
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [REASONING]
The function find_max takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "of", "string"], we need to sort the list of strings based on the length of the unique characters in each string.
The sorted function is used with the key parameter set to a lambda function that takes a string x and returns a tuple containing the length of the unique characters in x and x itself.
The sorted function then sorts the list of strings based on the first element of the tuple, which is the length of the unique characters in each string.
The first element of the sorted list is then returned as the output of the function.
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"string"
[/OUTPUT]</s>
