The function `count_upper` is called with ( s = 'dBBE' ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The character at index 0 is 'd', which is not in "AEIOU".
Iteration 2:
    - The character at index 2 is 'B', which is in "AEIOU".
    - The condition `s[i] in "AEIOU"` is true.
    - Action: `count += 1` updates `count` to 1.
