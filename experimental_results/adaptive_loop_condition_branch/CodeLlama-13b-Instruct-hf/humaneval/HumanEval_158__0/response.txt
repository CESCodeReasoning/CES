<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def find_max(words):
    return sorted(words, key=lambda x: (-len(set(x)), x))[0]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
find_max(["play", "this", "game", "of","footbott"])
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [REASONING]
The function find_max takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string that appears only once in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["play", "this", "game", "of","footbott"], we need to:

1. Sort the list of strings by the length of the set of characters in each string. This is done using the sorted() function with the key parameter set to a lambda function that takes a string x and returns the tuple (-len(set(x)), x). The negative length of the set of characters is used to sort the strings in descending order.
2. Return the first element of the sorted list, which is the longest string that appears only once in the list.
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"footbott"
[/OUTPUT]</s>
