The function find_max takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string that appears only once in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["play", "this", "game", "of","footbott"], we need to:

1. Sort the list of strings by the length of the set of characters in each string. This is done using the sorted() function with the key parameter set to a lambda function that takes a string x and returns the tuple (-len(set(x)), x). The negative length of the set of characters is used to sort the strings in descending order.
2. Return the first element of the sorted list, which is the longest string that appears only once in the list.
