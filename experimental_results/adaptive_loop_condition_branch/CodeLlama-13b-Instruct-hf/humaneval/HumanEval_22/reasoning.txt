The function filter_integers takes a list of values as input and returns a list of integers.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and check if each element is an integer using the isinstance function. If an element is an integer, it is added to the output list.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b'], we need to iterate over the input list and check if each element is an integer.
The first element, 3, is an integer, so it is added to the output list. The second element, 'c', is not an integer, so it is not added to the output list. The third element, 3, is an integer, so it is added to the output list. The fourth element, 3, is an integer, so it is added to the output list. The fifth element, 'a', is not an integer, so it is not added to the output list. The sixth element, 'b', is not an integer, so it is not added to the output list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b'] is [3, 3, 3].
