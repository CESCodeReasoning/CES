The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is 1, and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 2.
    - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true, so `ans` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is 2, and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 3.
    - The condition is true, so `ans` becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    - `i` is 2, `arr[i]` is 3, and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 2.
    - The condition is false, so `ans` remains 2.
Iteration 4:
    - `i` is 3, `arr[i]` is 4, and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 3.
    - The condition is false, so `ans` remains 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2])` is 2.
