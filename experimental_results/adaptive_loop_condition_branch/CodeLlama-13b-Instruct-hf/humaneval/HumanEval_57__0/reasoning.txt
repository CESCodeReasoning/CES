The function `monotonic` is called with ( l = [4, 1, 0, -10] ).
The list `l` is not equal to its sorted version ( `sorted(l)` ), nor is it equal to its sorted version with the `reverse` parameter set to `True` ( `sorted(l, reverse=True)` ).
Therefore, the if branch is not taken and the method returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])` is False.
