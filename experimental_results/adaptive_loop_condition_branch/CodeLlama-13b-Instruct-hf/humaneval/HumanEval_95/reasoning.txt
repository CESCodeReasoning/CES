The function `check_dict_case` is called with ( dict = {"p":"pineapple", "b":"banana"} ).
Inside the function, a variable `state` is initialized to "start".

Iteration 1:
    - The key "p" is not uppercase, so `state` becomes "mixed".
    - The loop breaks.

Therefore, the final output of the function `check_dict_case(dict)` is False.
