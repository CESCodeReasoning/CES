The function exchange is called with ( lst1 = [1, 2, 3, 4], lst2 = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, two variables odd and even are initialized to 0.

First, the loop iterates through lst1 and checks if each element is odd or even.
    - The first element is 1, which is odd.
    - The second element is 2, which is even.
    - The third element is 3, which is odd.
    - The fourth element is 4, which is even.

Therefore, the value of odd is 2 and the value of even is 2.

Next, the loop iterates through lst2 and checks if each element is odd or even.
    - The first element is 1, which is odd.
    - The second element is 2, which is even.
    - The third element is 3, which is odd.
    - The fourth element is 4, which is even.

Therefore, the value of odd is 2 and the value of even is 2.

Finally, the condition ( even >= odd ) is checked.
    - The value of even is 2, which is greater than or equal to the value of odd, which is 2.

Therefore, the function returns "YES".
