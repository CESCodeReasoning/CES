<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def sort_third(l: list):
    l = list(l)
    l[::3] = sorted(l[::3])
    return l
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sort_third([5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10])
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [PYTHON]
def sort_third(l):
    l = list(l)
    l[::3] = sorted(l[::3])
    return l
[/PYTHON]

[TESTS]
# Test case 1:
assert sort_third([5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10]) == [-12, 4, 8, 11, 12, -10, 2, 3, 5, 23]
# Test case 2:
assert sort_third([]) == []
# Test case 3:
assert sort_third([1]) == [1]
# Test case 4:
assert sort_third([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[/TESTS]
