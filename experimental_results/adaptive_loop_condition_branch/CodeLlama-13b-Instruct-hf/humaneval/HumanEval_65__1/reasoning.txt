The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 12, shift = 1 ).
`x` is 12, which is a string of length 2.
`shift` is 1, which is less than the length of `x`.
The if branch is taken, and the method returns `s[len(s) - shift:] + s[:len(s) - shift]`, which is "21".

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(12, 1)` is "21".
