The function is_bored takes a string S as input and returns the number of sentences in S that start with the word "I ".
To determine the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "Hello world", we need to split the string into sentences using the regular expression r'[.?!]\s*'.
This will give us a list of sentences, which we can then iterate over to count the number of sentences that start with the word "I ".
Therefore, the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "Hello world" is 0.
