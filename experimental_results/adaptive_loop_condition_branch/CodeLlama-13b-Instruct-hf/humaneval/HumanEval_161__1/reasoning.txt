The function `solve` is called with ( s = "ab" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` is initialized to 0.
A variable `idx` is initialized to 0.
A variable `new_str` is initialized to a list of characters in `s`.

Iteration 1:
    - The character 'a' is alpha, so `new_str[idx]` is updated to 'A'.
    - `flg` is set to 1.
    - `idx` is incremented to 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The character 'b' is alpha, so `new_str[idx]` is updated to 'B'.
    - `flg` is set to 1.
    - `idx` is incremented to 2.

Since `flg` is 1, the function returns the string "Ab".
