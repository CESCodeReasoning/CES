The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '03-11-2000' ).
The date is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.
The date is split into its constituent parts (month, day, and year) using the '-' character as the delimiter.
The month, day, and year are converted to integers.
The month is checked to ensure it is between 1 and 12.
The month is not between 1 and 12, therefore the if branch is not taken and the method returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('03-11-2000')` is False.
