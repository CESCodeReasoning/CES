The function `any_int` is called with ( x = 3, y = 4, z = 7 ).
All three arguments are integers, which satisfies (isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int)).
The if branch is taken.
The condition (x + y == z) is True, since (3 + 4 == 7).
The condition (x + z == y) is False, since (3 + 7 != 4).
The condition (y + z == x) is False, since (4 + 7 != 3).
The or operator is used, so the first condition that is True is returned.

Therefore, the final output of the function `any_int(3,4,7)` is True.
