<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    note_map = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}
    return [note_map[x] for x in music_string.split(' ') if x]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
parse_music('') 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [PYTHON]
def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    note_map = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}
    return [note_map[x] for x in music_string.split(' ') if x]
[/PYTHON]

[TESTS]
# Test case 1:
assert parse_music('') == []
# Test case 2:
assert parse_music('o') == [4]
# Test case 3:
assert parse_music('o|') == [2]
# Test case 4:
assert parse_music('.|') == [1]
# Test case 5:
assert parse_music('o o| .|') == [4, 2, 1]
[/TESTS]

[REASONING]
The function parse_music takes a string as input and returns a list of integers.
The function first creates a dictionary called note_map, which maps each character in the input string to an integer value.
The function then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string, and for each character, it looks up the corresponding integer value in the note_map dictionary and appends it to the output list.
Finally, the function returns the output list.
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[4, 2, 1]
[/OUTPUT]

[EXPLANATION]
The function parse_music takes the input string 'o o| .|' and splits it into individual characters using the split() method.
The characters are then iterated over using a list comprehension, and for each character, the corresponding integer value is looked up in the note_map dictionary and appended to the output list.
The output list is then returned as the final output of the function.
