The function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter takes a string txt as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the last character of the string is a letter.
To determine the output of the function, we need to follow these steps:

1. Split the input string into a list of words using the split() method with a space as the delimiter.
2. Get the last word from the list using the [-1] index.
3. Check if the last word has only one character and if the character is a letter (between 97 and 122 in the ASCII table).
4. Return True if the last word is a letter, and False otherwise.

Therefore, the output of the function for the input "A" is False, because the last character of the string "A" is not a letter.
