The function `move_one_ball` is called with ( arr = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `sorted_array` is initialized to the sorted version of `arr`.
A variable `my_arr` is initialized to an empty list.
The minimum value in `arr` is found and its index is found.
The elements of `arr` are rearranged in `my_arr` such that the minimum value is at the beginning.
The loop iterates from 0 to 4 (since ( len(arr) = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `my_arr[i]` is 3, which is not equal to `sorted_array[i]` (3).
   - The condition `my_arr[i] != sorted_array[i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` is executed, and the function returns False.
