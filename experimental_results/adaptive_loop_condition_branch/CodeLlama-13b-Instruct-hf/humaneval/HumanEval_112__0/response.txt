<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def reverse_delete(s, c):
    s = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in c])
    return (s, s[::-1] == s)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
reverse_delete("abcdedcba","v")
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [PYTHON]
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    s = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in c])
    return (s, s[::-1] == s)
[/PYTHON]

[REASONING]
The function reverse_delete takes two inputs: a string s and a character c.
The function first removes all occurrences of the character c from the string s using a list comprehension.
Then, it returns a tuple containing the modified string and a boolean value indicating whether the string is a palindrome or not.
To determine whether the string is a palindrome, the function checks if the string is equal to its reverse.
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
('abcdedcba', False)
[/OUTPUT]</s>
