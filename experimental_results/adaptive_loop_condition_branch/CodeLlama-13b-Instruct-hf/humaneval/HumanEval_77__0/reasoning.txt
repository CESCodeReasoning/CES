The function iscube takes a single argument a and returns a boolean value indicating whether a is a perfect cube.
To determine the output of executing the function iscube on the input 2, we need to follow the steps of the function:

1. The input 2 is passed to the function and assigned to the variable a.
2. The absolute value of a is calculated using the abs() function, which returns the positive value of a.
3. The cube root of a is calculated using the (1. / 3) exponent, which returns the cube root of a.
4. The cube root of a is rounded to the nearest integer using the round() function.
5. The cube of the rounded integer is calculated using the ** operator.
6. The equality comparison between the cube of the rounded integer and a is performed using the == operator.
7. The result of the comparison is returned as the output of the function.

Therefore, the output of executing the function iscube on the input 2 is True, because 2 is a perfect cube.
