The function count_distinct_characters takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string.
To determine the number of distinct characters in the input string, we need to convert the string to lowercase and then use the set() function to remove any duplicates.
The length of the resulting set is the number of distinct characters in the input string.
