<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len(set(string.lower()))
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
count_distinct_characters('abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE') 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [PYTHON]
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len(set(string.lower()))
[/PYTHON]

[TESTS]
# Test case 1:
assert count_distinct_characters('') == 0
# Test case 2:
assert count_distinct_characters('a') == 1
# Test case 3:
assert count_distinct_characters('abc') == 3
# Test case 4:
assert count_distinct_characters('aabbcc') == 3
# Test case 5:
assert count_distinct_characters('aabbccdd') == 4
[/TESTS]

[REASONING]
The function count_distinct_characters takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string.
To determine the number of distinct characters in the input string, we need to convert the string to lowercase and then use the set() function to remove any duplicates.
The length of the resulting set is the number of distinct characters in the input string.
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
4
[/OUTPUT]
