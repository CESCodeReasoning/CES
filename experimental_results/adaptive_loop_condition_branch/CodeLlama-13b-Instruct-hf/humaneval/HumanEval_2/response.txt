<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return number % 1.0
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
truncate_number(3.5) 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [REASONING]
The function truncate_number takes a float number as input and returns the decimal part of the number.
To determine the output of executing the function truncate_number on the input 3.5, we need to calculate the decimal part of 3.5.
Therefore, the output of executing the function truncate_number on the input 3.5 is 0.5.
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
0.5
[/OUTPUT]</s>
