The function add takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the even-indexed elements.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 0, 6, 7], we need to calculate the sum of the even-indexed elements.
The even-indexed elements are 0 and 6, so the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 0, 6, 7] is 6.
