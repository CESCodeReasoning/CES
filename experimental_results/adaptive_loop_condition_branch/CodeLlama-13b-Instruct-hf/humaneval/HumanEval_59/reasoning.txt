The function `largest_prime_factor` is called with ( n = 15 ).
Inside the function, a variable `largest` is initialized to 1.

Iteration 1:
    - The value of `j` is 2, which is not a prime number.
Iteration 2:
    - The value of `j` is 3, which is a prime number.
    - The value of `largest` is updated to 3.
Iteration 3:
    - The value of `j` is 4, which is not a prime number.
Iteration 4:
    - The value of `j` is 5, which is a prime number.
    - The value of `largest` is updated to 5.
Iteration 5:
    - The value of `j` is 6, which is not a prime number.
Iteration 6:
    - The value of `j` is 7, which is a prime number.
    - The value of `largest` is updated to 7.
Iteration 7:
    - The value of `j` is 8, which is not a prime number.
Iteration 8:
    - The value of `j` is 9, which is a prime number.
    - The value of `largest` is updated to 9.
Iteration 9:
    - The value of `j` is 10, which is not a prime number.
Iteration 10:
    - The value of `j` is 11, which is a prime number.
    - The value of `largest` is updated to 11.
Iteration 11:
    - The value of `j` is 12, which is not a prime number.
Iteration 12:
    - The value of `j` is 13, which is a prime number.
    - The value of `largest` is updated to 13.
Iteration 13:
    - The value of `j` is 14, which is not a prime number.
Iteration 14:
    - The value of `j` is 15, which is a prime number.
    - The value of `largest` is updated to 15.

Therefore, the final output of the function `largest_prime_factor(15)` is 3.
