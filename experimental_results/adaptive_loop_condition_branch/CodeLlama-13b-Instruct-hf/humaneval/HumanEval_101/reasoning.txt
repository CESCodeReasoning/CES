The function `words_string` is called with ( s = "Hi, my name is John" ).
Inside the function, a variable `s_list` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    - The character 'H' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 2:
    - The character 'i' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 3:
    - The character ',' is equal to ',', so a space is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 4:
    - The character ' ' (space) is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 5:
    - The character 'm' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 6:
    - The character 'y' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 7:
    - The character ' ' (space) is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 8:
    - The character 'n' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 9:
    - The character 'a' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 10:
    - The character 'm' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 11:
    - The character 'e' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 12:
    - The character ' ' (space) is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 13:
    - The character 'i' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 14:
    - The character 's' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 15:
    - The character ' ' (space) is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 16:
    - The character 'J' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 17:
    - The character 'o' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 18:
    - The character 'h' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 19:
    - The character 'n' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to `s_list`.

The final value of `s_list` is "Hi my name is John".
The function returns the list of words in the string, which is ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"].
