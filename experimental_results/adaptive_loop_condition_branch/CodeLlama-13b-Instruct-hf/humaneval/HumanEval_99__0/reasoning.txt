The function `closest_integer` is called with the argument "14.5".
The first condition `value.count('.') == 1` is satisfied, therefore the first branch is taken.
Inside the first branch, the while loop iterates and removes the trailing zeros from the string "14.5".
After the loop completes, the string becomes "14.5".
The second condition `value[-2:] == '.5'` is satisfied, therefore the second branch is taken.
Inside the second branch, the if statement checks if `num > 0` is true.
Since `num` is equal to 14.5, which is greater than 0, the if statement is true.
Therefore, the `ceil` function is called and the result is 15.
The final return statement returns the result 15.
