The function `by_length` is called with (arr = [1, -1, 3, 2] ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `dic` is created with keys as numbers from 1 to 9 and their corresponding values as strings.
`sorted_arr` is created by sorting the input array `arr` in descending order.
The loop iterates through the sorted array `sorted_arr`.
First Iteration (var = 3):
    `var` is 3, so `dic[var]` is "Three".
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends "Three" to `new_arr`.
Second Iteration (var = 2):
    `var` is 2, so `dic[var]` is "Two".
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends "Two" to `new_arr`.
Third Iteration (var = 1):
    `var` is 1, so `dic[var]` is "One".
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends "One" to `new_arr`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `new_arr`, which is now ["Three", "Two", "One"].
