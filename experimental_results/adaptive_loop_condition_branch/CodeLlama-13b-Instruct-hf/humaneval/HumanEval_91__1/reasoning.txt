The function is_bored takes a string S as input and returns the number of sentences in S that start with "I ".
To determine the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "I love It !", we need to split the string into sentences using the regular expression r'[.?!]\s*'.
This will give us a list of sentences, where each sentence is a substring of the original string.
Next, we need to count the number of sentences that start with "I ".
We can do this by iterating over the list of sentences and checking if the first two characters of each sentence are "I ".
If a sentence starts with "I ", we add 1 to the count.
Finally, we return the count.
