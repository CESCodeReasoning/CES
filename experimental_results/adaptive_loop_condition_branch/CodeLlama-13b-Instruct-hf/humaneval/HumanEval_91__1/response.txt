<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def is_bored(S):
    import re
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)
    return sum(sentence[0:2] == 'I ' for sentence in sentences)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
is_bored("I love It !")
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [REASONING]
The function is_bored takes a string S as input and returns the number of sentences in S that start with "I ".
To determine the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "I love It !", we need to split the string into sentences using the regular expression r'[.?!]\s*'.
This will give us a list of sentences, where each sentence is a substring of the original string.
Next, we need to count the number of sentences that start with "I ".
We can do this by iterating over the list of sentences and checking if the first two characters of each sentence are "I ".
If a sentence starts with "I ", we add 1 to the count.
Finally, we return the count.
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
1
[/OUTPUT]</s>
