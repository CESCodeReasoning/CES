The function `check_dict_case` is called with ( dict = {"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"} ).
Inside the function, a variable `state` is initialized to "start".

Iteration 1:
    - The key "Name" is not an instance of str, so the state is set to "mixed".
Iteration 2:
    - The key "Age" is not an instance of str, so the state is set to "mixed".
Iteration 3:
    - The key "City" is not an instance of str, so the state is set to "mixed".

Since the state is set to "mixed", the function returns False.
