The function `search` is called with ( lst = [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] ).
Inside the function, a variable `frq` is initialized to a list of 0s with length equal to the maximum value in `lst` plus 1.

Iteration 1:
    - `i` is 8, and `frq[i]` is 8.
    - `frq[i] += 1` updates `frq[i]` to 9.
Iteration 2:
    - `i` is 8, and `frq[i]` is 9.
    - `frq[i] += 1` updates `frq[i]` to 10.
Iteration 3:
    - `i` is 8, and `frq[i]` is 10.
    - `frq[i] >= i` is true, so `ans` is updated to 8.

Therefore, the final output of the function `search([8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8])` is 8.
