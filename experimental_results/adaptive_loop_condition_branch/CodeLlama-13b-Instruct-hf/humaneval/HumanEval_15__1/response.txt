<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join([str(x) for x in range(n + 1)])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
string_sequence(10)
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [PYTHON]
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join([str(x) for x in range(n + 1)])
[/PYTHON]

[TESTS]
# Test case 1:
assert string_sequence(10) == "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
# Test case 2:
assert string_sequence(1) == "0 1"
# Test case 3:
assert string_sequence(0) == "0"
[/TESTS]
