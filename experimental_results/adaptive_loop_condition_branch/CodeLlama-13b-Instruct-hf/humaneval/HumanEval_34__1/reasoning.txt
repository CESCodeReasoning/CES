The function unique takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of unique elements in l.
To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1], we need to first convert the list to a set to remove duplicates.
Then, we sort the set and convert it back to a list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1] is [1, 2].
