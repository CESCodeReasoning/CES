The function get_positive takes a list l as input and returns a new list containing all the elements of l that are greater than 0.
To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2], we need to iterate through the list [-1, -2] and check if each element is greater than 0.
Since both elements of the list are less than or equal to 0, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2] is an empty list.
