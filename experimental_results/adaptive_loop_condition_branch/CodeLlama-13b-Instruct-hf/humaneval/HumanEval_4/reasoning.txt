The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the list.
The MAD is the average of the absolute differences between each element in the list and the mean of the list.
To calculate the MAD, we first calculate the mean of the list using the sum of the elements and the length of the list.
Then, we calculate the absolute differences between each element in the list and the mean, and sum them up.
Finally, we divide the sum of the absolute differences by the length of the list to get the MAD.
