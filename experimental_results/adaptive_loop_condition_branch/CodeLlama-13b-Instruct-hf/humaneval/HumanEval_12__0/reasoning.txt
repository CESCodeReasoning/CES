The function `longest` is called with ( strings = ['x', 'y', 'z'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxlen` is initialized to the maximum length of the strings in the list.
The loop iterates through the list of strings.
First Iteration (s = 'x'):
   - `s` is 'x', which has a length of 1.
   - The condition `len(s) == maxlen` is false (since `maxlen` is 3).
   - Action: `s` is not returned.
Second Iteration (s = 'y'):
   - `s` is 'y', which has a length of 1.
   - The same condition is false.
   - Action: `s` is not returned.
Third Iteration (s = 'z'):
   - `s` is 'z', which has a length of 1.
   - The same condition is false.
   - Action: `s` is not returned.
Since none of the strings have a length equal to `maxlen`, the function returns `None`.
