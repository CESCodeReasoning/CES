The function make_a_pile takes an integer n as input and returns a list of length n, where each element is equal to n + 2 * i, where i is the index of the element.
To determine the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 6, we need to evaluate the list comprehension [n + 2 * i for i in range(n)].
The list comprehension iterates over the range of integers from 0 to 5 (inclusive), and for each i, it evaluates the expression n + 2 * i, where n is 6.
Therefore, the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 6 is [6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16].
