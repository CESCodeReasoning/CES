The function `generate_integers` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns a list of all even integers between `a` and `b`, inclusive.

The function first finds the lower and upper bounds of the range of integers to be generated. The lower bound is the maximum of 2 and the minimum of `a` and `b`, while the upper bound is the minimum of 8 and the maximum of `a` and `b`.

The function then generates a list of all integers between the lower and upper bounds, inclusive, and filters the list to include only even integers.

Finally, the function returns the filtered list of even integers.
