The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'xywyx' ).
Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 4 (since ( len(text) = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 <= i < len(text) ).
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` exits the function and returns False.
