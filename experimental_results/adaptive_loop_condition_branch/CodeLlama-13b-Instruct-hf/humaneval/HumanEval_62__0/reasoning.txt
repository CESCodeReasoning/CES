The function derivative takes a list of numbers xs as input and returns a list of numbers representing the derivative of the function defined by xs.
To determine the output of executing the function derivative on the input [1], we need to compute the derivative of the function defined by [1].
The derivative of a constant function is zero, so the output of executing the function derivative on the input [1] is [].
