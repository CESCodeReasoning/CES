The function triangle_area takes two arguments, a and h, and returns the area of a triangle with base a and height h.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (5, 3), we need to calculate the area of a triangle with base 5 and height 3.
The formula for the area of a triangle is A = (base x height) / 2.0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (5, 3) is (5 x 3) / 2.0 = 7.5.
