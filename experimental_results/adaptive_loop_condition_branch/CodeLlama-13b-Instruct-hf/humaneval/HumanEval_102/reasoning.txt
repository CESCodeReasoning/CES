The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 12, y = 15 ).
The first condition `x > y` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The second condition `y % 2 == 0` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns `y`, which is 15.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(12, 15)` is 15.
