<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def sort_array(array):
    return [] if len(array) == 0 else sorted(
        array, reverse=(array[0] + array[-1]) % 2 == 0)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sort_array([5])
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [REASONING]
The function sort_array takes an array as input and returns an empty array if the length of the array is 0, otherwise it returns the sorted array.
The sorted function is used to sort the array, and the reverse parameter is set to True if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, otherwise it is set to False.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [5], we need to check if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even.
The sum of the first and last elements of the array is 5 + 5 = 10, which is even.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [5] is [].
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[]
[/OUTPUT]</s>
