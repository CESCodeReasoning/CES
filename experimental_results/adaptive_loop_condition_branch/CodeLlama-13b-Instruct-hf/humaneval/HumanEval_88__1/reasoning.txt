The function sort_array takes an array as input and returns an empty array if the length of the array is 0, otherwise it returns the sorted array.
The sorted function is used to sort the array, and the reverse parameter is set to True if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, otherwise it is set to False.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [5], we need to check if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even.
The sum of the first and last elements of the array is 5 + 5 = 10, which is even.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [5] is [].
