<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    note_map = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}
    return [note_map[x] for x in music_string.split(' ') if x]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
parse_music('o| .| o| .| o o| o o|')
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [REASONING]
The function `parse_music` takes a string `music_string` as input and returns a list of integers.

The function first defines a dictionary `note_map` that maps each character in the input string to a corresponding integer value. The dictionary maps the characters 'o', 'o|', and '.|' to the integers 4, 2, and 1, respectively.

The function then splits the input string `music_string` into a list of individual characters using the `split` method with a space character as the delimiter.

Next, the function filters out any empty strings from the list of characters using the `if x` condition. This is done because the `split` method may produce empty strings if there are multiple consecutive delimiters in the input string.

Finally, the function returns a list of integers by mapping each character in the filtered list to its corresponding integer value using the `note_map` dictionary.

[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4]
[/OUTPUT]</s>
