The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 3, b = 7 ).
Inside the function, a variable `a` is initialized to 3.
First Iteration:
    - b = 7, a % b = 3.
    -`a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 7 and `b` to 3.
Second Iteration:
    - b = 3, a % b = 1.
    -`a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 3 and `b` to 1.
Third Iteration:
    - b = 1, a % b = 0.
    -`a, b = b, a % b` updates `a` to 1 and `b` to 0.
The while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 1.
