The function `bf` is called with ( planet1 = "Earth", planet2 = "Earth" ).
The condition `planet1 not in planet_names or planet2 not in planet_names or planet1 == planet2` is false, since all the planets are in the list of planet names.
The condition `planet1 == planet2` is true, since both planets are "Earth".
Therefore, the if branch is not taken and the method returns an empty tuple.

Therefore, the final output of the function `bf("Earth", "Earth")` is `()`.
