The function `how_many_times` is called with ( string = 'john doe', substring = 'john' ).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The substring 'john' is not found in the string 'john doe'.
Iteration 2:
    - The substring 'john' is not found in the string 'ohn doe'.
Iteration 3:
    - The substring 'john' is not found in the string 'hn doe'.
Iteration 4:
    - The substring 'john' is not found in the string 'n doe'.
Iteration 5:
    - The substring 'john' is found in the string 'john doe'.
Iteration 6:
    - The substring 'john' is not found in the string 'ohn doe'.
Iteration 7:
    - The substring 'john' is not found in the string 'hn doe'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `how_many_times('john doe', 'john')` is 1.
