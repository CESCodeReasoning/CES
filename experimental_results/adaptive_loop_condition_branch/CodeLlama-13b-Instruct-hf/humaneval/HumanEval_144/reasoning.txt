The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "1/5", n = "5/1" ).
`x` is "1/5", which is a string.
`n` is "5/1", which is also a string.
The function splits both strings into two parts using the "/" character as the delimiter.
`a` is "1", `b` is "5", `c` is "5", and `d` is "1".
The numerator is calculated as `int(a) * int(c)`, which is 5.
The denominator is calculated as `int(b) * int(d)`, which is 5.
The condition `numerator/denom == int(numerator/denom)` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns True

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("1/5", "5/1")` is True.
