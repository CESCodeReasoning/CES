The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '01-01-2007' ).
The date is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.
The date is split into its constituent parts (month, day, and year) using the '-' character as the delimiter.
The month, day, and year are converted to integers.
The month is checked to ensure it is between 1 and 12.
The day is checked to ensure it is between 1 and 31 for months with 31 days, and between 1 and 30 for months with 30 days.
The year is checked to ensure it is a valid year.
If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns False.
If all conditions are met, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('01-01-2007')` is True.
