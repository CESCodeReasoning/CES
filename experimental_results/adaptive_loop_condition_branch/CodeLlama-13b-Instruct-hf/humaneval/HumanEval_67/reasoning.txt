The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "5 apples and 6 oranges", n = 19 ).
Inside the function, a list `lis` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    - The string "5" is a digit, so it is appended to `lis`.
Iteration 2:
    - The string "apples" is not a digit, so it is not appended to `lis`.
Iteration 3:
    - The string "and" is not a digit, so it is not appended to `lis`.
Iteration 4:
    - The string "6" is a digit, so it is appended to `lis`.
Iteration 5:
    - The string "oranges" is not a digit, so it is not appended to `lis`.

The function returns `n - sum(lis)`, which is 19 - 5 - 6 = 8.
