The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Hello' ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the length of the input string, which is 5.

First Condition:
    - The length of the input string is 5, which satisfies the condition `l == 0 or l == 1`.
    - The function returns `False`.

Second Condition:
    - The length of the input string is 5, which does not satisfy the condition `l == 0`.
    - The function proceeds to the next condition.

Third Condition:
    - The length of the input string is 5, which does not satisfy the condition `l == 1`.
    - The function proceeds to the next condition.

Fourth Condition:
    - The length of the input string is 5, which satisfies the condition `l > 1`.
    - The function proceeds to the `for` loop.

For Loop:
    - The loop iterates from 2 through 4 (since ( l = 5 )).
    - The loop condition `l % i == 0` is evaluated for each iteration.
    - The loop condition is `False` for all iterations, so the loop completes.

Return Statement:
    - After the loop completes, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `prime_length('Hello')` is `False`.
