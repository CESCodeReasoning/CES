The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "AB" ).
Inside the function, a variable `primes` is initialized to a tuple of prime numbers.
The loop iterates through the characters of the input string `num`.
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `num[i]` is 'A', which is not in `primes`.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `num[i]` is 'B', which is in `primes`.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
The loop completes, and the function returns the value of `total`, which is 1.
