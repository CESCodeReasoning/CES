The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [1, -1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `num` is 1, `s` becomes 1.
    - `s` is greater than 0, so `s` remains 1.
    - `max_sum` is updated to 1.
Iteration 2:
    - `num` is -1, `s` becomes 0.
    - `s` is less than 0, so `s` becomes 0.
    - `max_sum` is updated to 0.

The final value of `max_sum` is 0, and the final value of `min_sum` is -0, which is 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([1, -1])` is 0.
