The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input and returns a new string where each word in the input string is sorted and concatenated.
To determine the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input "Hello World!!!", we need to follow these steps:

1. Split the input string "Hello World!!!" into a list of words using the split() method with the delimiter as a space. This gives us the list ["Hello", "World", "!!!"]
2. For each word in the list, sort the characters in the word using the sorted() method. This gives us the list ["!", "!", "!", "H", "W", "e", "l", "l", "o", "r", "d"]
3. Join the sorted characters in each word using the join() method with the delimiter as an empty string. This gives us the string "! ! ! H W e l l o r d"
4. Return the joined string as the output of the function.

Therefore, the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input "Hello World!!!" is "! ! ! H W e l l o r d".
