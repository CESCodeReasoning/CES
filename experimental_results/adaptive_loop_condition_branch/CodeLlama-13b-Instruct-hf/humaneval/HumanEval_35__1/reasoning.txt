The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [3, 2, -3.5, 0] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list `l`, which is 3.
The loop iterates through the list `l`.
First Iteration (e = 3):
   - `e` is 3, which is greater than `m`, so `m` is updated to 3.
Second Iteration (e = 2):
   - `e` is 2, which is less than `m`, so `m` remains 3.
Third Iteration (e = -3.5):
   - `e` is -3.5, which is less than `m`, so `m` remains 3.
Fourth Iteration (e = 0):
   - `e` is 0, which is less than `m`, so `m` remains 3.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `m`, which is 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `max_element([3, 2, -3.5, 0])` is 3.
