The function `int_to_mini_roman` is called with ( number = 900 ).
Inside the function, a variable `num` is initialized to a list of integers representing the Roman numerals.
A variable `sym` is initialized to a list of strings representing the Roman numerals.
A variable `i` is initialized to 12.
A variable `res` is initialized to an empty string.
The while loop iterates from 12 to 0 (since ( number = 900 )).
First Iteration (i = 12):
    - number = 900, num[i] = 1000.
    - div = number // num[i] = 900 // 1000 = 0.
    - number %= num[i] = 900 % 1000 = 900.
    - while div: is False, so the loop is not executed.
Second Iteration (i = 11):
    - number = 900, num[i] = 900.
    - div = number // num[i] = 900 // 900 = 1.
    - number %= num[i] = 900 % 900 = 0.
    - while div: is True, so the loop is executed.
    - res += sym[i] updates res to "M" (  + "M" = "M" ).
    - div -= 1 updates div to 0.
    - while div: is False, so the loop is not executed.
Third Iteration (i = 10):
    - number = 900, num[i] = 500.
    - div = number // num[i] = 900 // 500 = 1.
    - number %= num[i] = 900 % 500 = 0.
    - while div: is True, so the loop is executed.
    - res += sym[i] updates res to "D" (  + "D" = "MD" ).
    - div -= 1 updates div to 0.
    - while div: is False, so the loop is not executed.
Fourth Iteration (i = 9):
    - number = 900, num[i] = 100.
    - div = number // num[i] = 900 // 100 = 9.
    - number %= num[i] = 900 % 100 = 0.
    - while div: is True, so the loop is executed.
    - res += sym[i] updates res to "XC" (  + "XC" = "MDXC" ).
    - div -= 1 updates div to 8.
    - while div: is True, so the loop is executed.
    - res += sym[i] updates res to "XC" (  + "XC" = "MDXCXC" ).

    - div -= 1 updates div to 4.
    - while div: is True, so the loop is executed.
    - res += sym[i] updates res to "XC" (  + "XC" = "MDXCXCXCXCXCXC" ).
    - div -= 1 updates div to 3.
    - while div: is True, so the loop is executed.
    - res += sym[i] updates res to "XC" (  + "XC" = "MDXCXCXCXCXCXCXC" ).
    - div -= 1 updates div to 2.

    - div -= 1 updates div to 0.
    - while div: is False, so the loop is not executed.
Fifth Iteration (i = 8):
    - number = 900, num[i] = 50.
    - div = number // num[i] = 900 // 50 = 18.
    - number %= num[i] = 900 % 50 = 0.
    - while div: is True, so the loop is executed.
    - res += sym[i] updates res to "L" (  + "L" = "MDXCXCXCXCXCXCXCXCXCL" ).
    - div -= 1 updates div to 17.
    - while div: is True, so the loop is executed.

    - div -= 1 updates div to 16.
    - while div: is True, so the loop is executed.

    - div -= 1 updates div to 15.
    - while div: is True, so the loop is executed.
    - res += sym[i] updates res to "L" (  + "L" = "MDXCXCXCXCXCXCXCXCXCLXLXLXL" ).
    - div -= 1 updates div to 14.
    - while div: is True, so the loop is executed.
