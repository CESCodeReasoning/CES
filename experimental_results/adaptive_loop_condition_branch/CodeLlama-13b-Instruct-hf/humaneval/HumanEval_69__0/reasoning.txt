The function `search` is called with ( lst = [2, 7, 8, 8, 4, 8, 7, 3, 9, 6, 5, 10, 4, 3, 6, 7, 1, 7, 4, 10, 8, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `frq` is initialized to a list of 0s with length equal to the maximum value in `lst` plus 1.

Iteration 1:
    - The value of `i` is 2, which is not in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The value of `i` is 7, which is not in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    - The value of `i` is 8, which is not in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    - The value of `i` is 8, which is already in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 3.
Iteration 5:
    - The value of `i` is 4, which is not in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 1.
Iteration 6:
    - The value of `i` is 8, which is already in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 4.
Iteration 7:
    - The value of `i` is 7, which is already in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 2.
Iteration 8:
    - The value of `i` is 3, which is not in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 1.
Iteration 9:
    - The value of `i` is 9, which is not in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 1.
Iteration 10:
    - The value of `i` is 6, which is not in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 1.
Iteration 11:
    - The value of `i` is 5, which is not in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 1.
Iteration 12:
    - The value of `i` is 10, which is not in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 1.
Iteration 13:
    - The value of `i` is 4, which is already in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 2.
Iteration 14:
    - The value of `i` is 3, which is already in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 3.
Iteration 15:
    - The value of `i` is 6, which is already in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 2.
Iteration 16:
    - The value of `i` is 7, which is already in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 3.
Iteration 17:
    - The value of `i` is 1, which is not in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 1.
Iteration 18:
    - The value of `i` is 7, which is already in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 4.
Iteration 19:
    - The value of `i` is 4, which is already in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 2.
Iteration 20:
    - The value of `i` is 10, which is already in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 2.
Iteration 21:
    - The value of `i` is 8, which is already in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 5.
Iteration 22:
    - The value of `i` is 1, which is already in `frq`, so `frq[i]` becomes 2.

The final value of `frq` is [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 5, 6].

The loop iterates from 1 to 10 (since the length of `frq` is 11).

In the loop, the condition `frq[i] >= i` is checked.

The first time the condition is true is when `i` is 8, since `frq[8]` is 5, and 5 is greater than or equal to 8.

Therefore, the final output of the function `search` is 8.
