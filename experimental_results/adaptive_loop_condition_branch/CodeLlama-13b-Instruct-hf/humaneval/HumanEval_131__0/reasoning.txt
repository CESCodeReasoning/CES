The function `digits` is called with ( n = 120 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1.
A variable `odd_count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The character '1' is converted to an integer and assigned to `int_digit`.
    - Since `int_digit` is odd, `product` is updated to 1 * 1 = 1.
    - `odd_count` is incremented to 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The character '2' is converted to an integer and assigned to `int_digit`.
    - Since `int_digit` is even, `product` remains 1.
    - `odd_count` remains 1.
Iteration 3:
    - The character '0' is converted to an integer and assigned to `int_digit`.
    - Since `int_digit` is even, `product` remains 1.
    - `odd_count` remains 1.

Since `odd_count` is not 0, the function returns `product`, which is 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digits(120)` is 180.
