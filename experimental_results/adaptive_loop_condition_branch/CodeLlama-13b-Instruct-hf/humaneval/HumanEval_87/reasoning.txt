The function get_row takes a 2D list lst and an integer x as input.
It first generates a list of tuples coords, where each tuple contains the coordinates of the elements in lst that are equal to x.
The coordinates are generated by iterating over the rows and columns of lst using nested for loops, and checking if the element at each position is equal to x.
The list of tuples coords is then sorted first by the second element of each tuple (i.e., the column index), and then by the first element of each tuple (i.e., the row index).
Finally, the sorted list of tuples is returned.
