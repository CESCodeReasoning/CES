The function `fizz_buzz` is called with ( n = 100000 ).
Inside the function, a variable `ns` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 0 through 99999 (since ( n = 100000 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is false.
   - No action is taken.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is false.
   - No action is taken.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is false.
   - No action is taken.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is false.
   - No action is taken.
...
Ninth Iteration (i = 9)
   - `i` is 9, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is false.
   - No action is taken.
Tenth Iteration (i = 10)
   - `i` is 10, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is false.
   - No action is taken.
...
Ninety-Ninth Iteration (i = 99999)
   - `i` is 99999, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is false.
   - No action is taken.
Hundredth Iteration (i = 100000)
   - `i` is 100000, which does not satisfy ( i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is false.
   - No action is taken.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fizz_buzz(100000)` is 0.
