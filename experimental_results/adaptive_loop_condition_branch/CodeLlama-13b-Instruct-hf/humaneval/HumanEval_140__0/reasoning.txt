The function `fix_spaces` is called with the string "Exa   mple".
Inside the function, a variable `new_text` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates through the string, starting from the first character.
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - `text[i] == " "` is true, so `end` is incremented.
    - `end - start > 2` is false, so the first branch is not taken.
    - `end - start > 0` is true, so the second branch is taken.
    - `new_text` is updated to "E".
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - `text[i] == " "` is true, so `end` is incremented.
    - `end - start > 2` is false, so the first branch is not taken.
    - `end - start > 0` is true, so the second branch is taken.
    - `new_text` is updated to "Ex".
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - `text[i] == " "` is true, so `end` is incremented.
    - `end - start > 2` is false, so the first branch is not taken.
    - `end - start > 0` is true, so the second branch is taken.
    - `new_text` is updated to "Exa".
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - `text[i] == " "` is true, so `end` is incremented.
    - `end - start > 2` is false, so the first branch is not taken.
    - `end - start > 0` is true, so the second branch is taken.
    - `new_text` is updated to "Exam".
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - `text[i] == " "` is true, so `end` is incremented.
    - `end - start > 2` is false, so the first branch is not taken.
    - `end - start > 0` is true, so the second branch is taken.
    - `new_text` is updated to "Examp".
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - `text[i] == " "` is true, so `end` is incremented.
    - `end - start > 2` is false, so the first branch is not taken.
    - `end - start > 0` is true, so the second branch is taken.
    - `new_text` is updated to "Exampl".
Seventh Iteration (i = 6):
    - `text[i] == " "` is true, so `end` is incremented.
    - `end - start > 2` is false, so the first branch is not taken.
    - `end - start > 0` is true, so the second branch is taken.
    - `new_text` is updated to "Exampl".
Eighth Iteration (i = 7):
    - `text[i] == " "` is false, so `end` is not incremented.
    - `end - start > 2` is false, so the first branch is not taken.
    - `end - start > 0` is true, so the second branch is taken.
    - `new_text` is updated to "Exampl-".
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `new_text`, which is now "Exa-mple".
