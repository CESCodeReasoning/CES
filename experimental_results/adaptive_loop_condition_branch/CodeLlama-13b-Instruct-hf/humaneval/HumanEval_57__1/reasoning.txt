The function `monotonic` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 4, 20] ).
The list `l` is not equal to its sorted version, therefore the first condition is false.
The list `l` is not equal to its sorted version with `reverse=True`, therefore the second condition is false.
The first condition is false and the second condition is false, therefore the if branch is not taken and the method returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])` is False.
