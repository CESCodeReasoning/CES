The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "<<><>>" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The character '<' is encountered, so `depth` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The character '<' is encountered again, so `depth` becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    - The character '>' is encountered, so `depth` becomes 1.
Iteration 4:
    - The character '>' is encountered again, so `depth` becomes 0.
Iteration 5:
    - The character '<' is encountered, so `depth` becomes -1.
Iteration 6:
    - The character '>' is encountered again, so `depth` becomes -2.

Since `depth` becomes negative at some point, the function returns `False`.
