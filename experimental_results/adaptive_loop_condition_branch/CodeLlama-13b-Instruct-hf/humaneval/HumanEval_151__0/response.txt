<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def double_the_difference(lst):
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i %
               2 != 0 and "." not in str(i)])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
double_the_difference([-10, -20, -30])
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [PYTHON]
def double_the_difference(lst):
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i % 2 != 0 and "." not in str(i)])
[/PYTHON]

[TESTS]
# Test case 1:
assert double_the_difference([-10, -20, -30]) == 0
# Test case 2:
assert double_the_difference([1, 2, 3]) == 14
# Test case 3:
assert double_the_difference([-1, -2, -3]) == 0
# Test case 4:
assert double_the_difference([1.5, 2.5, 3.5]) == 0
# Test case 5:
assert double_the_difference([10, 20, 30]) == 2200
