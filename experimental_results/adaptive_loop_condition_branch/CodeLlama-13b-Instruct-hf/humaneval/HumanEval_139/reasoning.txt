The function `special_factorial` is called with (n = 4).
Inside the function, two variables `fact_i` and `special_fact` are initialized to 1.
`range(1, (n + 1))` = [1, 2, 3, 4] since (n + 1) = 5.
The loop iterates from 1 to 4 since `range(1, (n + 1))` = [1, 2, 3, 4].

First Iteration(i = 1):
    fact_i = 1 * 1 = 1
    special_fact = 1 * 1 = 1
Second Iteration(i = 2):
    fact_i = 1 * 2 = 2
    special_fact = 1 * 2 = 2
Third Iteration(i = 3):
    fact_i = 1 * 3 = 3
    special_fact = 1 * 3 = 3
Forth Iteration(i = 4):
    fact_i = 1 * 4 = 4
    special_fact = 1 * 4 = 4
Fifth Iteration(i = 5):
    fact_i = 1 * 5 = 5
    special_fact = 1 * 5 = 5
