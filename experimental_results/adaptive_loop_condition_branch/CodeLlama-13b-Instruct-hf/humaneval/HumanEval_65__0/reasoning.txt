The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 97, shift = 8 ).
`x` is 97, which is a string representation of the integer 97.
`shift` is 8, which is a positive integer.
The condition `shift > len(s)` is false, since `len(s)` is 2 and `shift` is 8.
Therefore, the else branch is taken and the method returns `s[len(s) - shift:] + s[:len(s) - shift]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(97, 8)` is "79".
