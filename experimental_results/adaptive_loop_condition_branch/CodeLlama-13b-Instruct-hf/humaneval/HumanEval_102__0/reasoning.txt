The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 13, y = 12 ).
`x` is 13, which is not greater than `y` which is 12.
The first condition `x > y` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The second condition `y % 2 == 0` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The third condition `x == y` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The else branch is taken and the method returns `y - 1`, which is 11.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(13, 12)` is 11.
