The function encode takes a string message as input and returns a new string with the following modifications:

1. The vowels in the message are replaced with their corresponding characters two positions ahead in the ASCII table.
2. The case of the message is swapped.

To determine the output of executing the function encode on the input "YES", we need to follow these steps:

1. The vowels in "YES" are "Y" and "E".
2. The corresponding characters two positions ahead in the ASCII table are "Z" and "G".
3. The case of "YES" is swapped to "yes".
4. The resulting string is "zg".

Therefore, the output of executing the function encode on the input "YES" is "zg".
