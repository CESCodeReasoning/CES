The function words_in_sentence(sentence) takes a sentence as its parameter.
The function first splits the sentence into a list of words using the split() method.
Then it iterates through each word in the list and checks if it is a palindrome.
A word is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
The function checks if the length of the word is 1, if it is, then it is a palindrome.
If the length of the word is greater than 1, then it checks if the length of the word is divisible by 2, 3, 4, ..., n-1, where n is the length of the word.
If the length of the word is divisible by any of these numbers, then it is not a palindrome.
If the length of the word is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is a palindrome.
