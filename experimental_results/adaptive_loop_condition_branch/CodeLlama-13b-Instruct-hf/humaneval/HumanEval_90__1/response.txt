<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def next_smallest(lst):
    lst = sorted(set(lst))
    return None if len(lst) < 2 else lst[1]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
next_smallest([])
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [REASONING]
The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input and returns the next smallest integer in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [], we need to first sort the list and remove any duplicates.
Since the list is empty, the sorted list is also empty, and there are no duplicates to remove.
Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [] is None.
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
None
[/OUTPUT]</s>
