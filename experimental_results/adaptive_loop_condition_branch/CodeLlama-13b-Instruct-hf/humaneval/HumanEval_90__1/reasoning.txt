The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input and returns the next smallest integer in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [], we need to first sort the list and remove any duplicates.
Since the list is empty, the sorted list is also empty, and there are no duplicates to remove.
Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [] is None.
