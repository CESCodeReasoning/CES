The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the list.

To calculate the MAD, we first calculate the mean of the list using the formula:

mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

Next, we calculate the absolute deviation of each number from the mean using the formula:

abs(x - mean)

Finally, we calculate the MAD by dividing the sum of the absolute deviations by the length of the list:

MAD = sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
