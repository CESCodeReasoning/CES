The function `get_odd_collatz` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_collatz` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 1 through 1 (since ( n = 1 )).
First Iteration (n = 1):
    - n > 1 when n=1
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is true. The second branch is taken.
    - `odd_collatz.append(int(n))` updates `odd_collatz` to [1] ( [] + [1] = [1] ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `odd_collatz`, which is now [1].
