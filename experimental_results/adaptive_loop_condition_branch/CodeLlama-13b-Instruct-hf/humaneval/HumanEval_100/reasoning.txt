The function make_a_pile takes an integer n as input and returns a list of integers.
The list is created using a list comprehension, which iterates over the range of integers from 0 to n-1.
For each integer i, the expression n + 2*i is evaluated and added to the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 3 is [3, 5, 7].
