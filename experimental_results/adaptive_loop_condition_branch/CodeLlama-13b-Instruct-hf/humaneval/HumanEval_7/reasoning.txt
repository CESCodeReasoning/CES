The function filter_by_substring takes two arguments: a list of strings (strings) and a substring (substring). It returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that contain the given substring.

To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input [[] and 'john', we need to:

1. Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty list.
2. Check if the substring is in any of the strings in the input list. If it is, return a list containing only the strings that contain the substring.

Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input [[] and 'john' is [].
