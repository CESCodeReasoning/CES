<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if substring in x]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
filter_by_substring([], 'john') 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [REASONING]
The function filter_by_substring takes two arguments: a list of strings (strings) and a substring (substring). It returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that contain the given substring.

To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input [[] and 'john', we need to:

1. Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty list.
2. Check if the substring is in any of the strings in the input list. If it is, return a list containing only the strings that contain the substring.

Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input [[] and 'john' is [].
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[]
[/OUTPUT]</s>
