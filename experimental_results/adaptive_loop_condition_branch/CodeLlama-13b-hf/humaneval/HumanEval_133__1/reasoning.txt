The function `sum_squares` is called with (lst = [-2.4, 1, 1]).
Inside the function, a variable `squared` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 to 2 since `range(len(lst))`= [0, 1, 2].

First Iteration(i = 0):
    lst[i] = -2.4
    squared = 0 + math.ceil(-2.4)**2 results in squared = 16
Second Iteration(i = 1):
    lst[i] = 1
    squared = 16 + math.ceil(1)**2 results in squared = 25
Third Iteration(i = 2): 
    lst[i] = 1
    squared = 25 + math.ceil(1)**2 results in squared = 36
