The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = '0' ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 2 through 0 (since ( l = 0 )).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < l ).
   - The condition `l % i == 0` is true.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
