The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with ( n = 123 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `i` is 1, which is odd, so `odd_palindrome_count` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - `i` is 2, which is even, so `even_palindrome_count` becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    - `i` is 3, which is odd, so `odd_palindrome_count` becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    - `i` is 4, which is even, so `even_palindrome_count` becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    - `i` is 5, which is odd, so `odd_palindrome_count` becomes 3.
Iteration 6:
    - `i` is 6, which is even, so `even_palindrome_count` becomes 3.
Iteration 7:
    - `i` is 7, which is odd, so `odd_palindrome_count` becomes 4.
Iteration 8:
    - `i` is 8, which is even, so `even_palindrome_count` becomes 4.
Iteration 9:
    - `i` is 9, which is odd, so `odd_palindrome_count` becomes 5.
Iteration 10:
    - `i` is 10, which is even, so `even_palindrome_count` becomes 5.
Iteration 11:
    - `i` is 11, which is odd, so `odd_palindrome_count` becomes 6.
Iteration 12:
    - `i` is 12, which is even, so `even_palindrome_count` becomes 6.
Iteration 13:
    - `i` is 13, which is odd, so `odd_palindrome_count` becomes 7.
