The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 5 (since ( len(lst) = 6 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - i < 6 when i=0
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])) is false.
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx) is false.
    - The condition (isPrime(lst[i])) is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - i < 6 when i=1
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])) is false.
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx) is false.
    - The condition (isPrime(lst[i])) is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - i < 6 when i=2
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])) is false.
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx) is false.
    - The condition (isPrime(lst[i])) is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - i < 6 when i=3
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])) is false.
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx) is false.
    - The condition (isPrime(lst[i])) is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - i < 6 when i=4
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])) is false.
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx) is false.
    - The condition (isPrime(lst[i])) is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - i < 6 when i=5
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])) is false.
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx) is false.
    - The condition (isPrime(lst[i])) is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `maxx`, which is now 0.
