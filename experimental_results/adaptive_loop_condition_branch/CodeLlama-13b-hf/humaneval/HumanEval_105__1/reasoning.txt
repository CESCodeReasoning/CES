The function `by_length` is called with (arr = [] ).
Inside the function, a variable `dic` is initialized to a dictionary.
`sorted_arr` is initialized to the sorted version of `arr` in descending order.
`new_arr` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates through `sorted_arr` which is an empty list.
