The function `by_length` is called with (arr = [1, -1, 3, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `dic` is initialized to a dictionary.
`sorted_arr` is initialized to the sorted version of `arr` in descending order.
`new_arr` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates through the elements of `sorted_arr`.
First Iteration(var = 3):
    `dic[var]` = 'Three'
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends 'Three' to `new_arr`.
Second Iteration(var = 2):
    `dic[var]` = 'Two'
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends 'Two' to `new_arr`.
Third Iteration(var = 1):
    `dic[var]` = 'One'
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends 'One' to `new_arr`.
