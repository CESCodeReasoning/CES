`n` is 1, which is not negative.
`n` is converted to a string, which is [1].
`n` is converted to a list, which is [1].
`n` is multiplied by `neg`, which is 1.
The sum of `n` is 1.
The function `digits_sum` is called with ( n = 6 ).
`n` is 6, which is not negative.
`n` is converted to a string, which is [6].
`n` is converted to a list, which is [6].
`n` is multiplied by `neg`, which is 1.
The sum of `n` is 6.
The function `digits_sum` is called with ( n = 9 ).
`n` is 9, which is not negative.
`n` is converted to a string, which is [9].
`n` is converted to a list, which is [9].
`n` is multiplied by `neg`, which is 1.
The sum of `n` is 9.
The function `digits_sum` is called with ( n = -6 ).
`n` is -6, which is negative.
`n` is multiplied by -1, which is 6.
