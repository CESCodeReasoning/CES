The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'aaaaa' ).
Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 4 (since ( len(text) = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` results in `False`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which still satisfies ( 0 <= i < 5 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `return False` results in `False`.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which still satisfies ( 0 <= i < 5 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `return False` results in `False`.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which still satisfies ( 0 <= i < 5 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `return False` results in `False`.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which now satisfies ( 0 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` results in `False`.
