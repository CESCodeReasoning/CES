The function `sum_product` is called with (numbers = [100, 0]).
Inside the function, a variable `sum_value` is initialized to 0.
A variable `prod_value` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 0 to 1 since `range(len(numbers))` = [0, 1]

First Iteration(i = 0):
    n = 100
    sum_value = 100
    prod_value = 100
Second Iteration(i = 1):
    n = 0
    sum_value = 100
    prod_value = 0
