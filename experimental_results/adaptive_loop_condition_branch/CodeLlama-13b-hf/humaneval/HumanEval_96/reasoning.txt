The function count_up_to(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4.
    - numbers[i]=2: compare with 3, 4:
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `i % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `i % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 2, 3.
    - numbers[i]=3: compare with 2, 3:
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=2), the condition `i % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `i % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 2, 3.
    - numbers[i]=4: compare with 2, 3:
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=2), the condition `i % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `i % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.
