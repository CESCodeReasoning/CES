The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -4, 5, 6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - balance = 1
Iteration 2:
    - balance = 3
Iteration 3:
    - balance = -1
    - The condition balance < 0 is true, so the function returns True.
