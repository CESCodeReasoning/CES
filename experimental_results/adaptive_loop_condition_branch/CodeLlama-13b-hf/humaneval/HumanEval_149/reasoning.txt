The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["aa", "a", "aaa"] ).
Inside the function, a variable `new_lst` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates through the list `lst`.
First Iteration (i = "aa")
   - `i` is "aa", which satisfies ( len(i)%2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `len(i)%2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` appends "aa" to `new_lst`.
Second Iteration (i = "a")
   - `i` is "a", which satisfies ( len(i)%2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `len(i)%2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` appends "a" to `new_lst`.
Third Iteration (i = "aaa")
   - `i` is "aaa", which satisfies ( len(i)%2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `len(i)%2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` appends "aaa" to `new_lst`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `new_lst`, which is now ["aa", "a", "aaa"].

Therefore, the final output of the function `sorted_list_sum(["aa", "a", "aaa"])` is ["aa", "a", "aaa"].
