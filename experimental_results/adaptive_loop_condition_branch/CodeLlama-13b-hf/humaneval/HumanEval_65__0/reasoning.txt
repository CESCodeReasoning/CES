The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 97, shift = 8 ).
`shift` is 8, which is greater than the length of the string representation of `x`, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns the string representation of `x` in reverse order.

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(97, 8)` is 79.
