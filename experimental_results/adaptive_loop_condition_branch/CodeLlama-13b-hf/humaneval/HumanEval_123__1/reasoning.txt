The function `get_odd_collatz` is called with ( n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_collatz` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( n = 5 )).
First Iteration (n = 5):
    - n > 1 when n=5
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is true. The second branch is taken.
    - `odd_collatz.append(int(n))` updates `odd_collatz` to [5].
Second Iteration (n = 16):
    - n > 1 when n=16
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `n = n / 2` updates `n` to 8.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is false. The second branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (n = 4):
    - n > 1 when n=4
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `n = n / 2` updates `n` to 2.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is false. The second branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (n = 2):
    - n > 1 when n=2
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `n = n / 2` updates `n` to 1.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is false. The second branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (n = 1):
    - n > 1 when n=1
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is false. The second branch is not taken.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `odd_collatz`, which is now [5].
