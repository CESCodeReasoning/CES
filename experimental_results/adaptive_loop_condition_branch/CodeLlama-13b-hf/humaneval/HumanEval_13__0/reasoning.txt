The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 10, b = 15 ).
Inside the function, a variable `a` is initialized to 10.
First Iteration:
    - b = 15, a % b = 5.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 15 and b to 5.
Second Iteration:
    - b = 5, a % b = 0.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 5 and b to 0.
The while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 5.
