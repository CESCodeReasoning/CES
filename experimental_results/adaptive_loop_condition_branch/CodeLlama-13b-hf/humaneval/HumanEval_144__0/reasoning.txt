The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "2/4", n = "8/4" ).
`x` is "2/4", which is split into ( a = "2", b = "4" ).
`n` is "8/4", which is split into ( c = "8", d = "4" ).
The numerator is calculated as ( a * c = 16 ).
The denominator is calculated as ( b * d = 16 ).
The condition `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns True

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("2/4", "8/4")` is True.
