The function `monotonic` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 4, 10] ).
`l` is [1, 2, 4, 10], which satisfies ( l == sorted(l) or l == sorted(l, reverse=True) ).
The condition `l == sorted(l)` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns True

Therefore, the final output of the function `monotonic([1, 2, 4, 10])` is True.
