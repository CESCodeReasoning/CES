The function `change_base` is called with ( x = 234, base = 2 ).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to "".
First Iteration:
    - x = 234, x % base = 0, x //= base, x = 117.
    - ret = "0" + ret, ret = "0".
Second Iteration:
    - x = 117, x % base = 1, x //= base, x = 58.
    - ret = "1" + ret, ret = "10".
Third Iteration:
    - x = 58, x % base = 0, x //= base, x = 29.
    - ret = "0" + ret, ret = "010".
Fourth Iteration:
    - x = 29, x % base = 1, x //= base, x = 14.
    - ret = "1" + ret, ret = "110".
Fifth Iteration:
    - x = 14, x % base = 0, x //= base, x = 7.
    - ret = "0" + ret, ret = "0110".
Sixth Iteration:
    - x = 7, x % base = 1, x //= base, x = 3.
    - ret = "1" + ret, ret = "1110".
Seventh Iteration:
    - x = 3, x % base = 1, x //= base, x = 1.
    - ret = "1" + ret, ret = "11110".
Eighth Iteration:
    - x = 1, x % base = 1, x //= base, x = 0.
    - ret = "1" + ret, ret = "111110".
The while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `ret`, which is now "111110".
