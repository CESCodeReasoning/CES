The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = "[[[[]]]]" ).
Inside the function, a variable `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` are initialized to empty lists.

Iteration 1:
    - The character '[' is not equal to '[', so the `opening_bracket_index` list is appended with 0.
Iteration 2:
    - The character '[' is not equal to '[', so the `opening_bracket_index` list is appended with 1.
Iteration 3:
    - The character '[' is not equal to '[', so the `opening_bracket_index` list is appended with 2.
Iteration 4:
    - The character '[' is not equal to '[', so the `opening_bracket_index` list is appended with 3.

    - The character ']' is not equal to '[', so the `closing_bracket_index` list is appended with 4.
Iteration 6:
    - The character ']' is not equal to '[', so the `closing_bracket_index` list is appended with 5.
Iteration 7:
    - The character ']' is not equal to '[', so the `closing_bracket_index` list is appended with 6.
Iteration 8:
