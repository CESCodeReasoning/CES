The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "You arE Very Smart" ).
`s` is "You arE Very Smart", which is not empty.
The condition `s == ""` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken and the method returns the sum of the ordinal values of the uppercase characters in `s`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digitSum("You arE Very Smart")` is 10.
