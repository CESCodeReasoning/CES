The function `solve` is called with ( s = "AsDf" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` and `idx` are initialized to 0.
Inside the function, a variable `new_str` is initialized to a list of characters in the string `s`.

Iteration 1:
    - The character 'A' is a letter, so `flg` becomes 1.
    - The character 'A' is a letter, so `new_str[0]` becomes 'A'.
Iteration 2:
    - The character 's' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
    - The character 's' is not a letter, so `new_str[1]` remains 's'.
Iteration 3:
    - The character 'D' is a letter, so `flg` becomes 1.
    - The character 'D' is a letter, so `new_str[2]` becomes 'd'.
Iteration 4:
    - The character 'f' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
    - The character 'f' is not a letter, so `new_str[3]` remains 'f'.
