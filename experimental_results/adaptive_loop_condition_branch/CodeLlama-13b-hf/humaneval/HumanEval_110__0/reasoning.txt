The function `exchange` is called with ( lst1 = [3, 2, 6, 1, 8, 9], lst2 = [3, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of lst1 is 3, which is odd, so odd becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element of lst1 is 2, which is even, so even becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The third element of lst1 is 6, which is odd, so odd becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth element of lst1 is 1, which is odd, so odd becomes 3.
Iteration 5:
    -The fifth element of lst1 is 8, which is odd, so odd becomes 4.
Iteration 6:
    -The sixth element of lst1 is 9, which is odd, so odd becomes 5.
Iteration 1:
    -The first element of lst2 is 3, which is even, so even becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element of lst2 is 5, which is odd, so odd becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The third element of lst2 is 5, which is even, so even becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth element of lst2 is 1, which is even, so even becomes 3.
Iteration 5:
    -The fifth element of lst2 is 1, which is even, so even becomes 4.
Iteration 6:
    -The sixth element of lst2 is 1, which is even, so even becomes 5.

Since even >= odd, the function returns "YES".
