The function count_up_to(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
