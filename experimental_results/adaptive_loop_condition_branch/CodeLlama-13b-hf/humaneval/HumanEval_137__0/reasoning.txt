The function `compare_one` is called with ( a = 5, b = 6 ).
`a` is 5, which is not a string.
`b` is 6, which is not a string.
The condition `isinstance(temp_a, str)` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition `isinstance(temp_b, str)` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition `float(temp_a) == float(temp_b)` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The method returns `a`

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one(5, 6)` is 5.
