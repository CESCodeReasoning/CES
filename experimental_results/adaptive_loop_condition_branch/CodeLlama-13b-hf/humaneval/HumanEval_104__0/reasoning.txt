The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [135, 103, 31] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_digit_elements` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    - The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is true, since all the digits of 135 are odd.
    - Action: `odd_digit_elements.append(i)` appends 135 to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 2:
    - The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is false, since 103 has an even digit.
Iteration 3:
    - The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is true, since all the digits of 31 are odd.
    - Action: `odd_digit_elements.append(i)` appends 31 to `odd_digit_elements`.
