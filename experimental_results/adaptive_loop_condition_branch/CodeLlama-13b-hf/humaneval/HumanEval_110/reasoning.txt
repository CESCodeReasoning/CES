The function `exchange` is called with ( lst1 = [1, 2, 3, 4], lst2 = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is odd, so odd becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 2 is even, so even becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 3 is odd, so odd becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 4 is even, so even becomes 2.
Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is odd, so odd becomes 3.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 2 is even, so even becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 3 is odd, so odd becomes 4.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 4 is even, so even becomes 4.

Since even >= odd, the function returns "YES".
