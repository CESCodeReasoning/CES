The function `minPath` is called with ( grid = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], k = 3 ).
Inside the function, a variable `val` is initialized to n * n + 1.

Iteration 1:
    - The value of `i` is 0.
    - The value of `j` is 0.
    - The value of `grid[i][j]` is 1.
    - The value of `val` is 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The value of `i` is 0.
    - The value of `j` is 1.
    - The value of `grid[i][j]` is 2.
    - The value of `val` is 2.
Iteration 3:
    - The value of `i` is 0.
    - The value of `j` is 2.
    - The value of `grid[i][j]` is 3.
    - The value of `val` is 3.
Iteration 4:
    - The value of `i` is 1.
    - The value of `j` is 0.
    - The value of `grid[i][j]` is 4.
    - The value of `val` is 4.
Iteration 5:
    - The value of `i` is 1.
    - The value of `j` is 1.
    - The value of `grid[i][j]` is 5.
    - The value of `val` is 5.
Iteration 6:
    - The value of `i` is 1.
    - The value of `j` is 2.
    - The value of `grid[i][j]` is 6.
    - The value of `val` is 6.
Iteration 7:
    - The value of `i` is 2.
    - The value of `j` is 0.
    - The value of `grid[i][j]` is 7.
    - The value of `val` is 7.
Iteration 8:
    - The value of `i` is 2.
    - The value of `j` is 1.
    - The value of `grid[i][j]` is 8.
    - The value of `val` is 8.
Iteration 9:
    - The value of `i` is 2.
    - The value of `j` is 2.
    - The value of `grid[i][j]` is 9.
    - The value of `val` is 9.
