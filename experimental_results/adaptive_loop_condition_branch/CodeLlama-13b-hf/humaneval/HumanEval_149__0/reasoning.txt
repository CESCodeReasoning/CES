The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["d", "dcba", "abcd", "a"] ).
Inside the function, a variable `new_lst` is initialized to an empty list.
The list is sorted in ascending order.
The loop iterates through the list.
First Iteration (i = "d"):
   - `i` is "d", which satisfies ( len(i) % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` appends "d" to `new_lst`.
Second Iteration (i = "abcd"):
   - `i` is "abcd", which satisfies ( len(i) % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` appends "abcd" to `new_lst`.
Third Iteration (i = "dcba"):
   - `i` is "dcba", which satisfies ( len(i) % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` appends "dcba" to `new_lst`.
Fourth Iteration (i = "a"):
   - `i` is "a", which satisfies ( len(i) % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` appends "a" to `new_lst`.
