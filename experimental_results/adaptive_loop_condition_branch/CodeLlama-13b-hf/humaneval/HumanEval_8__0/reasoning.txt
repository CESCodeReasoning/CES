The function `sum_product` is called with (numbers = [] ).
Inside the function, a variable `sum_value` is initialized to 0.
A variable `prod_value` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates through the elements of the list `numbers`.
Since `numbers` is empty, the loop does not iterate.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `sum_value` and `prod_value`, which are both 0.
