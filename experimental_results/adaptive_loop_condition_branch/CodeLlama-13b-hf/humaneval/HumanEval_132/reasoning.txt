The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = "[[]]" ).
Inside the function, a variable `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` are initialized to empty lists.

Iteration 1:
    - The character '[' is not equal to '[', so `opening_bracket_index` becomes [0].
Iteration 2:
    - The character ']' is not equal to '[', so `closing_bracket_index` becomes [1].
Iteration 3:
    - The character ']' is not equal to '[', so `closing_bracket_index` becomes [1, 2].
