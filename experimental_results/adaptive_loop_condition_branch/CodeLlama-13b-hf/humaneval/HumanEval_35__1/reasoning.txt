The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [3, 2, -3.5, 0] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list `l`.

Iteration 1:
    - The first element of the list `l` is 3, so `m` becomes 3.
Iteration 2:
    - The second element of the list `l` is 2, so `m` becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    - The third element of the list `l` is -3.5, so `m` becomes -3.5.
Iteration 4:
    - The fourth element of the list `l` is 0, so `m` becomes 0.
