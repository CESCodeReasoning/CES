The function `search` is called with ( lst = [5, 5, 5, 5, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `frq` is initialized to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Iteration 1:
    - The value of `i` is 5, so `frq[i]` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The value of `i` is 5, so `frq[i]` becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    - The value of `i` is 5, so `frq[i]` becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    - The value of `i` is 5, so `frq[i]` becomes 4.
Iteration 5:
    - The value of `i` is 1, so `frq[i]` becomes 1.
