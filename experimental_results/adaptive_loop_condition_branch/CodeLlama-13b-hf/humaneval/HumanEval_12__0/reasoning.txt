The function `longest` is called with ( strings = ['x', 'y', 'z'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxlen` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The length of 'x' is 1, which is greater than 0.
    - The length of 'y' is 1, which is greater than 0.
    - The length of 'z' is 1, which is greater than 0.
    - The maximum length is 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The length of 'x' is 1, which is greater than 1.
    - The length of 'y' is 1, which is greater than 1.
    - The length of 'z' is 1, which is greater than 1.
    - The maximum length is 1.
Iteration 3:
    - The length of 'x' is 1, which is greater than 1.
    - The length of 'y' is 1, which is greater than 1.
    - The length of 'z' is 1, which is greater than 1.
    - The maximum length is 1.
