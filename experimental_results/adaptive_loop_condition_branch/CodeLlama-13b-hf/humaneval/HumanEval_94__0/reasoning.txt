The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [127, 97, 8192] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 2 (since ( len(lst) = 3 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - i < 3 when i=0
    - The conditin `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - i < 3 when i=1
    - The conditin `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is false.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - i < 3 when i=2
    - The conditin `lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The condition `lst[i] > maxx` is true.
    - The condition `isPrime(lst[i])` is true.
    - The first branch is not taken.
    - The second branch is taken.
    - `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 8192.
    - `result = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(maxx))` updates `result` to 9.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `result`, which is now 9.
