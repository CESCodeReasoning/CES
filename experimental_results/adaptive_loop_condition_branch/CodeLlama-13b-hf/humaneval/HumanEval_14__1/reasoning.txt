The function `all_prefixes` is called with (string = '' ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to [].
`len(string)` = 0 since there are 0 characters in ''.
The loop iterates from 0 to -1 since `range(len(string))`= [0, -1]

First Iteration(i = 0):
    string[:i + 1] = ''
    result.append('')
Second Iteration(i = -1):
    string[:i + 1] = ''
    result.append('')
