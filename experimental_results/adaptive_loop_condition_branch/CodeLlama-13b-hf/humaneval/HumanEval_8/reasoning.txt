The function `sum_product` is called with (numbers = [1, 1, 1]).
Inside the function, a variable `sum_value` is initialized to 0.
A variable `prod_value` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 0 to 2 since `range(len(numbers))` = [0, 1, 2].

First Iteration(i = 0):
    n = 1
    sum_value = 1
    prod_value = 1
Second Iteration(i = 1):
    n = 1
    sum_value = 2
    prod_value = 1
Third Iteration(i = 2):
    n = 1
    sum_value = 3
    prod_value = 1
