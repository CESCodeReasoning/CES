The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 18 (since ( len(lst) = 19 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - i is 0, which satisfies ( 0 <= i < len(lst) ).
