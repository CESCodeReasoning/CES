The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [-5, 2, 48, 9, 4, 0, 6, 7] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list `l`.

Iteration 1:
    - The first element of the list `l` is -5, which is less than `m`, so `m` remains -5.
Iteration 2:
    - The second element of the list `l` is 2, which is less than `m`, so `m` remains -5.
Iteration 3:
    - The third element of the list `l` is 48, which is greater than `m`, so `m` becomes 48.
Iteration 4:
    - The fourth element of the list `l` is 9, which is greater than `m`, so `m` becomes 9.
Iteration 5:
    - The fifth element of the list `l` is 4, which is less than `m`, so `m` remains 9.
Iteration 6:
    - The sixth element of the list `l` is 0, which is less than `m`, so `m` remains 9.
Iteration 7:
    - The seventh element of the list `l` is 6, which is less than `m`, so `m` remains 9.
Iteration 8:
    - The eighth element of the list `l` is 7, which is less than `m`, so `m` remains 9.
