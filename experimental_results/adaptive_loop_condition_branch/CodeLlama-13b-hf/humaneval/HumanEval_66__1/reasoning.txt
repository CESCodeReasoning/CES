The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "aAaaaXa" ).
`s` is "aAaaaXa", which is not empty.
The condition `s == ""` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The return statement returns the sum of the ordinal values of the uppercase characters in `s`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digitSum("aAaaaXa")` is 10.
