The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [0] ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 0 through 0 (since ( len(lst) = 1 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 % 3 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` results in `result = [0]`.
