The function `histogram` is called with ( test = "a b c d g" ).
Inside the function, a variable `dict1` is initialized to {}.
A variable `list1` is initialized to the list of words in the string `test`.
A variable `t` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The word 'a' is not in the dictionary, so the dictionary remains empty.
Iteration 2:
    - The word 'b' is not in the dictionary, so the dictionary remains empty.
Iteration 3:
    - The word 'c' is not in the dictionary, so the dictionary remains empty.
Iteration 4:
    - The word 'd' is not in the dictionary, so the dictionary remains empty.
Iteration 5:
    - The word 'g' is not in the dictionary, so the dictionary remains empty.
