The function `get_odd_collatz` is called with ( n = 14 ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_collatz` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 1 through 14 (since ( n = 14 )).
First Iteration (n = 14):
    - n > 1 when n=14
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
