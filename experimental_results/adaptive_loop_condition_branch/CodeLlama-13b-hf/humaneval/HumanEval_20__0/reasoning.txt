The function find_closest_elements(numbers) takes a list of numbers([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=1.1: compare with 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1:
        - When j = 1 (numbers[j]=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=3.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=4.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=2.2: compare with 3.1, 4.1, 5.1:
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=3.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=4.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=3.1: compare with 4.1, 5.1:
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=4.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=4.1: compare with 5.1:
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - numbers[i]=5.1: compare with 5.1:
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=5.1), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.
