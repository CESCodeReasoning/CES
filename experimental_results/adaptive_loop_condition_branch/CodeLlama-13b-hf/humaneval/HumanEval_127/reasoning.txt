The function `intersection` is called with ( interval1 = (1, 2) ) and ( interval2 = (2, 3) ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` and `r` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The variable `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and 2, which is 2.
    - The variable `r` is set to the minimum of 2 and 3, which is 2.
    - The variable `length` is set to 2 - 2, which is 0.
    - The condition `length > 0 and is_prime(length)` is false, so the function returns "NO".
