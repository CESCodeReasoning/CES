The function `tri` is called with ( n = 8 ).
Inside the function, a variable `my_tri` is initialized to [1, 3].
The loop iterates from 2 through 8 (since ( n = 8 )).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which satisfies ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` updates `my_tri` to [1, 3, 2].
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which satisfies ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` updates `my_tri` to [1, 3, 2, 2].
Third Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which satisfies ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` updates `my_tri` to [1, 3, 2, 2, 3].
Fourth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which satisfies ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` updates `my_tri` to [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3].
Fifth Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is 6, which satisfies ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` updates `my_tri` to [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4].
Sixth Iteration (i = 7)
   - `i` is 7, which satisfies ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` updates `my_tri` to [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4].
Seventh Iteration (i = 8)
   - `i` is 8, which satisfies ( i % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` updates `my_tri` to [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5].
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `my_tri`, which is now [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5].

Therefore, the final output of the function `tri(8)` is [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5].
