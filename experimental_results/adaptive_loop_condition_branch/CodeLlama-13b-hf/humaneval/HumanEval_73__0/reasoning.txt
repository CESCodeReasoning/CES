The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1, 4, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 1 (since ( len(arr) // 2 ) = 1).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 <= i < 1 ).
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` results in `ans = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which satisfies ( 0 <= i < 1 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` updates `ans` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
