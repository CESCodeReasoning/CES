The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "abcCd" ).
`s` is "abcCd", which is not empty.
The condition `s == ""` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The return statement returns the sum of the ordinal values of the uppercase characters in the string.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digitSum("abcCd")` is 13.
