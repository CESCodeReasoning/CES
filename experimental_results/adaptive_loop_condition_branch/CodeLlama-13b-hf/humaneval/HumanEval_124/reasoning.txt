The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '03-11-2000' ).
The date is stripped of leading and trailing whitespaces.
The date is split into month, day and year.
The month, day and year are converted to integers.
The month is 3, which satisfies ( 1 <= month <= 12 ).
The day is 11, which satisfies ( 1 <= day <= 31 ).
The year is 2000, which satisfies ( 1 <= year <= 3000 ).
Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('03-11-2000')` is True.
