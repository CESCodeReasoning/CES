The function `is_happy` is called with ( s = "xyy" ).
Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 1 (since ( len(s) - 2 ) = 1).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 <= i < 3 ).
   - The condition `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is executed.
