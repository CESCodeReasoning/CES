The function find_closest_elements(numbers) takes a list of numbers([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by idx in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (idx=0):
    - `idx` is 0, idx2 in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
    - numbers[idx]=1.0: compare with 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2:
        - When idx2 = 1 (numbers[idx2]=2.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When idx2 = 2 (numbers[idx2]=3.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When idx2 = 3 (numbers[idx2]=4.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When idx2 = 4 (numbers[idx2]=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When idx2 = 5 (numbers[idx2]=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When idx2 = 6 (numbers[idx2]=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
Second Iteration (idx=1):
    - `idx` is 1, idx2 in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
    - numbers[idx]=2.0: compare with 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2:
        - When idx2 = 2 (numbers[idx2]=3.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When idx2 = 3 (numbers[idx2]=4.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When idx2 = 4 (numbers[idx2]=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When idx2 = 5 (numbers[idx2]=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When idx2 = 6 (numbers[idx2]=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
Third Iteration (idx=2):
    - `idx` is 2, idx2 in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5 and 6.
    - numbers[idx]=3.0: compare with 4.0, 5.0, 2.2:
        - When idx2 = 3 (numbers[idx2]=4.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When idx2 = 4 (numbers[idx2]=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When idx2 = 5 (numbers[idx2]=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When idx2 = 6 (numbers[idx2]=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
Forth Iteration (idx=3):
    - `idx` is 3, idx2 in the inner loop is 4, 5 and 6.
    - numbers[idx]=4.0: compare with 5.0, 2.2:
        - When idx2 = 4 (numbers[idx2]=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When idx2 = 5 (numbers[idx2]=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When idx2 = 6 (numbers[idx2]=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
Fifth Iteration (idx=4):
    - `idx` is 4, idx2 in the inner loop is 5 and 6.
    - numbers[idx]=5.0: compare with 2.2:
        - When idx2 = 5 (numbers[idx2]=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - When idx2 = 6 (numbers[idx2]=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
Sixth Iteration (idx=5):
    - `idx` is 5, idx2 in the inner loop is 6.
    - numbers[idx]=2.2: compare with 2.2:
        - When idx2 = 6 (numbers[idx2]=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
Seventh Iteration (idx=6):
    No more elements to compare.
