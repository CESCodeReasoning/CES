The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'b b b b a' ).
Inside the function, a variable `dict1` is initialized to {}.
A variable `list1` is initialized to ['b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'a'].
A variable `t` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The character 'b' is in list1, so t becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The character 'b' is in list1, so t becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    - The character 'b' is in list1, so t becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    - The character 'b' is in list1, so t becomes 4.
Iteration 5:
    - The character 'a' is in list1, so t becomes 1.
