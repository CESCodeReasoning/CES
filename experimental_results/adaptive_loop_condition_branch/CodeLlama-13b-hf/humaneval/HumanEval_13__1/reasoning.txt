The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 144, b = 60 ).
Inside the function, a variable `a` is initialized to 144.
First Iteration:
    - b = 60, a % b = 44.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 60 and b to 44.
Second Iteration:
    - b = 44, a % b = 24.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 44 and b to 24.
Third Iteration:
    - b = 24, a % b = 12.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 24 and b to 12.
Fourth Iteration:
    - b = 12, a % b = 0.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 12 and b to 0.
The while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 12.
