The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Wow' ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the length of the string.

Iteration 1:
    - The length of the string is 3, which is not 0 or 1.
Iteration 2:
    - 3 % 2 is 1, which is not 0.
Iteration 3:
    - 3 % 3 is 0, which is 0.
    - The function returns False.
