The function `how_many_times` is called with ( string = 'john doe', substring = 'john' ).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The substring 'john' is not equal to 'john', so times remains 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The substring 'ohn' is not equal to 'john', so times remains 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The substring 'hn' is not equal to 'john', so times remains 0.
Iteration 4:
    -The substring 'n' is not equal to 'john', so times remains 0.
Iteration 5:
    -The substring 'o' is not equal to 'john', so times remains 0.
Iteration 6:
    -The substring ' ' is not equal to 'john', so times remains 0.
Iteration 7:
    -The substring 'd' is not equal to 'john', so times remains 0.
Iteration 8:
    -The substring 'o' is not equal to 'john', so times remains 0.
Iteration 9:
    -The substring 'e' is not equal to 'john', so times remains 0.
