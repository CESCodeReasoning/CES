The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"] ).
Inside the function, a variable `new_lst` is initialized to an empty list.
The list is sorted in ascending order.
The loop iterates through the list.
First Iteration (i = "school")
   - `i` is "school", which satisfies ( len(i) % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` appends "school" to `new_lst`.
Second Iteration (i = "AI")
   - `i` is "AI", which satisfies ( len(i) % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` appends "AI" to `new_lst`.
Third Iteration (i = "asdf")
   - `i` is "asdf", which satisfies ( len(i) % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` appends "asdf" to `new_lst`.
Fourth Iteration (i = "b")
   - `i` is "b", which satisfies ( len(i) % 2 == 0 ).
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` appends "b" to `new_lst`.
The list `new_lst` is sorted in ascending order.
The function returns the sorted list `new_lst`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sorted_list_sum(["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"])` is ["AI", "asdf", "b", "school"].
