The function `intersection` is called with ( interval1 = [-1, 1] ) and ( interval2 = [0, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the maximum of the first element of `interval1` and the first element of `interval2`, which is 0.
A variable `r` is initialized to the minimum of the second element of `interval1` and the second element of `interval2`, which is 1.
A variable `length` is initialized to `r` - `l`, which is 1 - 0, which is 1.
The function `is_prime` is called with ( num = 1 ).
Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to 2.
