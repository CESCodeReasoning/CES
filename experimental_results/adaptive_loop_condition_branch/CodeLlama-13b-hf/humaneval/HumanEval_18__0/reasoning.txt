The function `how_many_times` is called with ( string = 'xyxyxyx', substring = 'x' ).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The substring 'x' is found at index 0, so times becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The substring 'x' is found at index 1, so times becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The substring 'x' is found at index 2, so times becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The substring 'x' is found at index 3, so times becomes 4.
Iteration 5:
    -The substring 'x' is found at index 4, so times becomes 5.
Iteration 6:
    -The substring 'x' is found at index 5, so times becomes 6.
Iteration 7:
    -The substring 'x' is found at index 6, so times becomes 7.
