The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [123, -123, 20, 0 , 1, 2, -3], k = 3 ).
`k` is 3, which is not equal to 0.
The if branch is not taken.
The `arr` is sorted.
The last 3 elements of the sorted `arr` are returned.

Therefore, the final output of the function `maximum([123, -123, 20, 0 , 1, 2, -3], 3)` is [20, 123, 123].
