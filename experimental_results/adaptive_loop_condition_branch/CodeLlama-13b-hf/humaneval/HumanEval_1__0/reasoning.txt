The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with ( paren_string = "(()(())((())))" ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.
Inside the function, a variable `current_string` is initialized to an empty list.
Inside the function, a variable `current_depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The character '(' is encountered, so the current depth becomes 1.
    - The character '(' is appended to the current string.
Iteration 2:
    - The character '(' is encountered, so the current depth becomes 2.
    - The character '(' is appended to the current string.
Iteration 3:
    - The character '(' is encountered, so the current depth becomes 3.
    - The character '(' is appended to the current string.
Iteration 4:
    - The character ')' is encountered, so the current depth becomes 2.
    - The character ')' is appended to the current string.
Iteration 5:
    - The character ')' is encountered, so the current depth becomes 1.
    - The character ')' is appended to the current string.
Iteration 6:
    - The character '(' is encountered, so the current depth becomes 2.
    - The character '(' is appended to the current string.
Iteration 7:
    - The character ')' is encountered, so the current depth becomes 1.
    - The character ')' is appended to the current string.
Iteration 8:
    - The character '(' is encountered, so the current depth becomes 2.
    - The character '(' is appended to the current string.
Iteration 9:
    - The character ')' is encountered, so the current depth becomes 1.
    - The character ')' is appended to the current string.
Iteration 10:
    - The character ')' is encountered, so the current depth becomes 0.
    - The character ')' is appended to the current string.
    - The current depth is 0, so the current string is appended to the result list.
    - The current string is cleared.
Iteration 11:
    - The character ')' is encountered, so the current depth becomes -1.
    - The character ')' is appended to the current string.
Iteration 12:
    - The character ')' is encountered, so the current depth becomes -2.
    - The character ')' is appended to the current string.
    - The current depth is -2, so the current string is appended to the result list.
    - The current string is cleared.
Iteration 13:
    - The character ')' is encountered, so the current depth becomes -3.
    - The character ')' is appended to the current string.
    - The current depth is -3, so the current string is appended to the result list.
    - The current string is cleared.
