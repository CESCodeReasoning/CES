The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [12345, 2033, 111, 151] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_digit_elements` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    - The number 12345 has all digits odd, so it is appended to the list.
Iteration 2:
    - The number 2033 has all digits odd, so it is appended to the list.
Iteration 3:
    - The number 111 has all digits odd, so it is appended to the list.
Iteration 4:
    - The number 151 has all digits odd, so it is appended to the list.
