The function `numerical_letter_grade` is called with ( grades = [4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `letter_grade` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:

    -The condition ( gpa > 2.3 ) is true.
    -Action: letter_grade.append("B-") updates letter_grade to ["A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-"].
Iteration 7:
    -The value of gpa is 3.0, which satisfies ( gpa > 2.0 ).
    -The condition ( gpa > 2.0 ) is true.
    -Action: letter_grade.append("C+") updates letter_grade to ["A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+"].
Iteration 8:
    -The value of gpa is 3.0, which satisfies ( gpa > 1.7 ).
    -The condition ( gpa > 1.7 ) is true.
    -Action: letter_grade.append("C") updates letter_grade to ["A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C"].
Iteration 9:
    -The value of gpa is 3.0, which satisfies ( gpa > 1.3 ).
    -The condition ( gpa > 1.3 ) is true.
    -Action: letter_grade.append("C-") updates letter_grade to ["A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-"].
Iteration 10:
    -The value of gpa is 3.0, which satisfies ( gpa > 1.0 ).
    -The condition ( gpa > 1.0 ) is true.
    -Action: letter_grade.append("D+") updates letter_grade to ["A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-", "D+"].
Iteration 11:
    -The value of gpa is 3.0, which satisfies ( gpa > 0.7 ).
    -The condition ( gpa > 0.7 ) is true.
    -Action: letter_grade.append("D") updates letter_grade to ["A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-", "D+", "D"].
Iteration 12:
    -The value of gpa is 3.0, which satisfies ( gpa > 0.0 ).
    -The condition ( gpa > 0.0 ) is true.
    -Action: letter_grade.append("D-") updates letter_grade to ["A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-", "D+", "D", "D-"].
Iteration 13:
    -The value of gpa is 3.0, which satisfies none of the conditions.
    -The condition ( gpa > 4.0 ) is false.
