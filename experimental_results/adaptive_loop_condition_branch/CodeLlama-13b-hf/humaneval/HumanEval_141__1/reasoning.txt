The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = '@this1_is6_valid.exe' ).
The variable `suf` is initialized to ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'].
The variable `lst` is initialized to ['@this1_is6_valid', 'exe'].
The condition `len(lst) != 2` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition `not lst[1] in suf` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition `len(lst[0]) == 0` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition `not lst[0][0].isalpha()` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition `t > 3` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The method returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `file_name_check('@this1_is6_valid.exe')` is 'Yes'.
