The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = "[][][[]]" ).
Inside the function, a variable `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` are initialized to empty lists.

Iteration 1:
    - The character '[' is not equal to ']', so the `opening_bracket_index` list is updated to [0].
Iteration 2:
    - The character ']' is not equal to '[', so the `closing_bracket_index` list is updated to [1].
Iteration 3:
    - The character '[' is not equal to ']', so the `opening_bracket_index` list is updated to [0, 2].
Iteration 4:
    - The character '[' is not equal to ']', so the `opening_bracket_index` list is updated to [0, 2, 4].
Iteration 5:
    - The character ']' is not equal to '[', so the `closing_bracket_index` list is updated to [1, 3].
Iteration 6:
    - The character ']' is not equal to '[', so the `closing_bracket_index` list is updated to [1, 3, 5].
Iteration 7:
    - The character '[' is not equal to ']', so the `opening_bracket_index` list is updated to [0, 2, 4, 6].
Iteration 8:
    - The character ']' is not equal to '[', so the `closing_bracket_index` list is updated to [1, 3, 5, 7].
Iteration 9:
    - The character ']' is not equal to '[', so the `closing_bracket_index` list is updated to [1, 3, 5, 7, 9].
Iteration 10:
    - The character ']' is not equal to '[', so the `closing_bracket_index` list is updated to [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11].

The `closing_bracket_index` list is reversed to [11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1].

The `cnt` variable is initialized to 0.
The `i` variable is initialized to 0.
The `l` variable is initialized to 6.

Iteration 1:
    - The `i` variable is less than `l`, so the `cnt` variable is updated to 1.
    - The `i` variable is updated to 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The `i` variable is less than `l`, so the `cnt` variable is updated to 2.
    - The `i` variable is updated to 2.
Iteration 3:
    - The `i` variable is less than `l`, so the `cnt` variable is updated to 3.
    - The `i` variable is updated to 3.
Iteration 4:
    - The `i` variable is less than `l`, so the `cnt` variable is updated to 4.
    - The `i` variable is updated to 4.
Iteration 5:
    - The `i` variable is less than `l`, so the `cnt` variable is updated to 5.
    - The `i` variable is updated to 5.
Iteration 6:
    - The `i` variable is less than `l`, so the `cnt` variable is updated to 6.
    - The `i` variable is updated to 6.
Iteration 7:
    - The `i` variable is not less than `l`, so the `cnt` variable is not updated.
    - The `i` variable is not updated.

The `cnt` variable is greater than or equal to 2, so the function returns True.
