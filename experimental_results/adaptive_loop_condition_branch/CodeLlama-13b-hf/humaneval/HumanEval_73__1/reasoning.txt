The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The first element of the array is 1, and the last element is 2.
    - Since they are not equal, ans becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The second element of the array is 2, and the last but one element is 3.
    - Since they are not equal, ans becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    - The third element of the array is 3, and the last but two element is 4.
    - Since they are not equal, ans becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    - The fourth element of the array is 4, and the last but three element is 3.
    - Since they are not equal, ans becomes 4.
Iteration 5:
    - The fifth element of the array is 3, and the last but four element is 2.
    - Since they are not equal, ans becomes 5.
Iteration 6:
    - The sixth element of the array is 2, and the last but five element is 2.
    - Since they are equal, ans remains 5.
