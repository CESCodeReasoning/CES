The function `median` is called with ( l = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5] ).
The list `l` is sorted to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The length of the list is 5, which is an odd number.
The condition `len(l) % 2 == 1` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns `l[len(l) // 2]` which is 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])` is 3.
