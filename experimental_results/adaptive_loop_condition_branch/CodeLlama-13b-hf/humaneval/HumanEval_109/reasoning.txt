The function `move_one_ball` is called with ( arr = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `sorted_array` is initialized to the sorted version of `arr`.
Inside the function, a variable `my_arr` is initialized to an empty list.
Inside the function, a variable `min_value` is initialized to the minimum value in `arr`.
Inside the function, a variable `min_index` is initialized to the index of `min_value` in `arr`.
Inside the function, `my_arr` is updated to be the concatenation of the sublist of `arr` starting from `min_index` to the end of `arr` and the sublist of `arr` starting from the beginning of `arr` to `min_index`.
Inside the function, the loop iterates from 0 to the length of `arr` (since ( len(arr) = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 <= i < len(arr) ).
   - The condition `my_arr[i] != sorted_array[i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` results in `False`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which still satisfies ( 0 <= i < len(arr) ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `return False` results in `False`.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which still satisfies ( 0 <= i < len(arr) ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `return False` results in `False`.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which now satisfies ( 3 <= i < len(arr) ).
   - The condition `my_arr[i] != sorted_array[i]` is false (while the first condition `i >= 1 and i <3` is false).
   - Action: `return True` results in `True`.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, also satisfying ( 3 <= i < len(arr) ).
   - The condition `my_arr[i] != sorted_array[i]` is false.
   - Action: `return True` results in `True`.
