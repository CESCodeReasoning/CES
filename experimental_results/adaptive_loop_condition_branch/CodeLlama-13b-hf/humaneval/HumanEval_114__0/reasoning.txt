The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [1, -1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `s` is 0, which is less than 0, so `s` is set to 0.
    - `max_sum` is 0, which is less than 0, so `max_sum` is set to 0.
Iteration 2:
    - `s` is -1, which is less than 0, so `s` is set to 0.
    - `max_sum` is 0, which is less than -1, so `max_sum` is set to -1.
