The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [5, -2, 1, -5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The number 5 is greater than 10, so the first if statement is true.
    - The first digit of 5 is 5, which is in the odd_digits list.
    - The last digit of 5 is 5, which is in the odd_digits list.
    - The count is incremented by 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The number -2 is less than 10, so the first if statement is false.
Iteration 3:
    - The number 1 is less than 10, so the first if statement is false.
Iteration 4:
    - The number -5 is less than 10, so the first if statement is false.
