The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [15, 33, 1422, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_digit_elements` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    - The condition `all (int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is true, since all the digits of 15 are odd.
    - Action: `odd_digit_elements.append(i)` appends 15 to the list.
Iteration 2:
    - The condition `all (int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is true, since all the digits of 33 are odd.
    - Action: `odd_digit_elements.append(i)` appends 33 to the list.
Iteration 3:
    - The condition `all (int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is false, since 1422 has even digits.
Iteration 4:
    - The condition `all (int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is true, since all the digits of 1 are odd.
    - Action: `odd_digit_elements.append(i)` appends 1 to the list.
