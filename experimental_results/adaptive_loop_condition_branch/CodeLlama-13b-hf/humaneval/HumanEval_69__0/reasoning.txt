The function `search` is called with ( lst = [2, 7, 8, 8, 4, 8, 7, 3, 9, 6, 5, 10, 4, 3, 6, 7, 1, 7, 4, 10, 8, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `frq` is initialized to [0] * (max(lst) + 1).

Iteration 1:
    - The value of `frq[2]` is 0, so it becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The value of `frq[7]` is 0, so it becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    - The value of `frq[8]` is 0, so it becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    - The value of `frq[8]` is 2, so it becomes 3.
Iteration 5:
    - The value of `frq[4]` is 0, so it becomes 1.
Iteration 6:
    - The value of `frq[8]` is 3, so it becomes 4.
Iteration 7:
    - The value of `frq[7]` is 1, so it becomes 2.
Iteration 8:
    - The value of `frq[3]` is 0, so it becomes 1.
Iteration 9:
    - The value of `frq[9]` is 0, so it becomes 1.
Iteration 10:
    - The value of `frq[6]` is 0, so it becomes 1.
Iteration 11:
    - The value of `frq[5]` is 0, so it becomes 1.
Iteration 12:
    - The value of `frq[10]` is 0, so it becomes 1.
Iteration 13:
    - The value of `frq[4]` is 1, so it becomes 2.
Iteration 14:
    - The value of `frq[3]` is 1, so it becomes 2.
Iteration 15:
    - The value of `frq[6]` is 1, so it becomes 2.
Iteration 16:
    - The value of `frq[7]` is 2, so it becomes 3.
Iteration 17:
    - The value of `frq[1]` is 0, so it becomes 1.
Iteration 18:
    - The value of `frq[7]` is 3, so it becomes 4.
Iteration 19:
    - The value of `frq[4]` is 2, so it becomes 3.
Iteration 20:
    - The value of `frq[10]` is 1, so it becomes 2.
Iteration 21:
    - The value of `frq[8]` is 4, so it becomes 5.
Iteration 22:
    - The value of `frq[1]` is 1, so it becomes 2.
Iteration 23:
    - The value of `frq[10]` is 2, so it becomes 3.
Iteration 24:
    - The value of `frq[8]` is 5, so it becomes 6.
Iteration 25:
    - The value of `frq[1]` is 2, so it becomes 3.

The value of `ans` is 6.
