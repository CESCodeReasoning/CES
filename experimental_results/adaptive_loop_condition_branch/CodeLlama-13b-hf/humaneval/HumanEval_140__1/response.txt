<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
3. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
4. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
5. Enclose the annotated code with [PYTHON] AND [/PYTHON]
6. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

Bellow are some examples:

[/QUESTION]

[REASONING]
The function `sum_up_to_n` is called with ( n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( n = 5 )).
First Iteration (current_number = 1):
    - current_number <= 5 when current_number=1
    - The conditin `current_number >= 1 and current_number < 3` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`total += 1` updates `total` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (current_number = 2):
    - current_number <= 5 when current_number=2
    - The conditin `current_number >= 1 and current_number < 3` is true.
    -`total += 1` updates `total` to 2 ( 1 + 1 = 2 ).
Third Iteration (current_number = 3)
    - current_number <= 5 when current_number=3.
    - The condition `current_number >= 1 and current_number < 3` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `current_number < 5` is true. The second branch is taken.
    -`total += 2` updates `total` to 4 ( 2 + 2 = 4 ).
Fourth Iteration (current_number = 4)
    -current_number <= 5 when current_number=4.
    - The condition `current_number >= 1 and current_number < 3` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `current_number < 5` is true. The second branch is taken.
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 6 ( 4 + 2 = 6 ).
Fifth Iteration (current_number = 5)
    -  current_number <= 5 when current_number=5
    - The condition `current_number >= 1 and current_number < 3` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `current_number < 5` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `total *= 4` updates `total` to 24 ( 6 * 4 = 24 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `total`, which is now 24.
