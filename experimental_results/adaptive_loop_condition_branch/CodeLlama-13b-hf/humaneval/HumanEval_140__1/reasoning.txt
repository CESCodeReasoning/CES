The function `fix_spaces` is called with ( text = "Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow" ).
Inside the function, a variable `new_text` is initialized to "".
The loop iterates from 0 through 29 (since ( len(text) = 29 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - i < 29 when i=0
    - The conditin `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
