The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` and `result` are initialized to None.

Iteration 1:
    - The variable `running_max` is None, so the condition `running_max is None` is true.
    - The variable `running_max` is assigned the value of `n`, which is 1.
    - The variable `result` is appended with the value of `running_max`, which is 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The variable `running_max` is 1, so the condition `running_max is None` is false.
    - The variable `running_max` is assigned the value of `max(running_max, n)`, which is 2.
    - The variable `result` is appended with the value of `running_max`, which is 2.
Iteration 3:
    - The variable `running_max` is 2, so the condition `running_max is None` is false.
    - The variable `running_max` is assigned the value of `max(running_max, n)`, which is 3.
    - The variable `result` is appended with the value of `running_max`, which is 3.
Iteration 4:
    - The variable `running_max` is 3, so the condition `running_max is None` is false.
    - The variable `running_max` is assigned the value of `max(running_max, n)`, which is 4.
    - The variable `result` is appended with the value of `running_max`, which is 4.
