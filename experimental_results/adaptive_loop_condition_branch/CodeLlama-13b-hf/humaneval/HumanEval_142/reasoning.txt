The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [1,2,3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 0 through 2 (since ( len(lst) = 3 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 % 3 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` results in `result = [1]`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which satisfies ( 1 % 4 == 0 ) and ( 1 % 3 != 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 4 == 0 and i%3 != 0` is true.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**3)` results in `result = [1, 8]`.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which satisfies neither ( 2 % 3 == 0 ) nor ( 2 % 4 == 0 ).
   - The `else` block's action: `result.append(lst[i])` results in `result = [1, 8, 3]`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `sum(result)`, which is 10.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_squares([1,2,3])` is 10.
