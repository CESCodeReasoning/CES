The function `solve` is called with ( s = "#a@C" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` and `idx` are initialized to 0.
Inside the function, a variable `new_str` is initialized to a list of characters in `s`.

Iteration 1:
    - The character '#' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 0.
    - `idx` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The character 'a' is a letter, so `flg` becomes 1.
    - `new_str[1]` becomes 'A'.
    - `idx` becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    - The character '@' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 1.
    - `idx` becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    - The character 'C' is a letter, so `flg` becomes 2.
    - `new_str[3]` becomes 'c'.
    - `idx` becomes 4.
Iteration 5:
    - The character '!' is not a letter, so `flg` remains 2.
    - `idx` becomes 5.

Since `flg` is 2, the function returns `s[len(s)::-1]`, which is "!C@a#".
