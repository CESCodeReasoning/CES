The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'xywzx' ).
Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 5 (since ( len(text) = 6 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 <= i < 6 ).
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which satisfies ( 1 <= i < 6 ).
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < 6 ).
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which satisfies ( 3 <= i < 6 ).
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which satisfies ( 4 <= i < 6 ).
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which satisfies ( 5 <= i < 6 ).
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
