The function `eat` is called with ( number = 4, need = 5, remaining = 1 ).
`need` is 5, which is less than `remaining` which is 1.
The condition `need <= remaining` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns [4 + 1, 1 - 1] which is [5, 0]

Therefore, the final output of the function `eat(4, 5, 1)` is [5, 0].
