The function `sum_squares` is called with (lst = [1,3,5,7]).
Inside the function, a variable `squared` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( N = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    `squared += math.ceil(i)**2` updates `squared` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    `squared += math.ceil(i)**2` updates `squared` to 9 ( 1 + 8 = 9 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    `squared += math.ceil(i)**2` updates `squared` to 25 ( 9 + 25 = 25 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
    `squared += math.ceil(i)**2` updates `squared` to 49 ( 25 + 49 = 49 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
    `squared += math.ceil(i)**2` updates `squared` to 81 ( 49 + 81 = 81 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `squared`, which is now 81.
