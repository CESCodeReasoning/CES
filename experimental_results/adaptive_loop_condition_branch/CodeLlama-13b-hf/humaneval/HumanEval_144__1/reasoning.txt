The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "5/1", n = "3/1" ).
`x` is "5/1", which is split into ( a = "5", b = "1" ).
`n` is "3/1", which is split into ( c = "3", d = "1" ).
The numerator is calculated as ( a * c = 15 ).
The denominator is calculated as ( b * d = 1 ).
The condition `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns True

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("5/1", "3/1")` is True.
