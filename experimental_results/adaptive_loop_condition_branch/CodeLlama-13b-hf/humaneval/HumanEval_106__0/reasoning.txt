The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 1.
    - numbers[i]=1: compare with 1:
        - When j = 1 (numbers[j]=1), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 1 to ret.
Second Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 1.
    - numbers[i]=2: compare with 1:
        - When j = 1 (numbers[j]=1), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 1.
    - numbers[i]=3: compare with 1:
        - When j = 1 (numbers[j]=1), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
