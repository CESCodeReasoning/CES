The function words_in_sentence(sentence) takes a sentence as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each word in the sentence.
In the inner loop, for each word indexed by i in the outer loop, check if the word is a palindrome.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5.
    - word[i]=g: check if it is a palindrome:
        - When j = 2 (word[j]=o), the condition `word[i] == word[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (word[j]=f), the condition `word[i] == word[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (word[j]=r), the condition `word[i] == word[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (word[j]=i), the condition `word[i] == word[j]` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - The word is not a palindrome.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5.
    - word[i]=o: check if it is a palindrome:
        - When j = 2 (word[j]=f), the condition `word[i] == word[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (word[j]=r), the condition `word[i] == word[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (word[j]=i), the condition `word[i] == word[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (word[j]=t), the condition `word[i] == word[j]` is True, the if branch is taken.
        - The word is not a palindrome.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - word[i]=f: check if it is a palindrome:
        - When j = 3 (word[j]=r), the condition `word[i] == word[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (word[j]=i), the condition `word[i] == word[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (word[j]=t), the condition `word[i] == word[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - The word is not a palindrome.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - word[i]=r: check if it is a palindrome:
        - When j = 4 (word[j]=i), the condition `word[i] == word[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (word[j]=t), the condition `word[i] == word[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - The word is not a palindrome.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - word[i]=i: check if it is a palindrome:
        - When j = 5 (word[j]=t), the condition `word[i] == word[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - The word is not a palindrome.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, j in the inner loop is 6.
    - word[i]=t: check if it is a palindrome:
        - When j = 6 (word[j]=), the condition `word[i] == word[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - The word is not a palindrome.
Seventh iteration (i=6):
    No more elements to compare.
