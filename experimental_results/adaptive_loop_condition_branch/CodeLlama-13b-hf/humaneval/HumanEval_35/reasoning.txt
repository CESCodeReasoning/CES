The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list `l`.

Iteration 1:
    - The first element of the list `l` is 1, so `m` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - The second element of the list `l` is 2, so `m` becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    - The third element of the list `l` is 3, so `m` becomes 3.
