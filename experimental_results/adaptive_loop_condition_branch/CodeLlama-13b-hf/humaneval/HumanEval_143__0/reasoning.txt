The function words_in_sentence(sentence) takes a sentence as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each word in the sentence.
In the inner loop, for each word indexed by i in the outer loop, check if the word is a prime number.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
    - word[i]=there: check if it is a prime number:
        - When j = 2 (word[j]=there), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (word[j]=there), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (word[j]=there), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (word[j]=there), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 6 (word[j]=there), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
    - word[i]=is: check if it is a prime number:
        - When j = 2 (word[j]=is), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (word[j]=is), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (word[j]=is), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (word[j]=is), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 6 (word[j]=is), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
    - word[i]=no: check if it is a prime number:
        - When j = 2 (word[j]=no), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (word[j]=no), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (word[j]=no), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (word[j]=no), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 6 (word[j]=no), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
    - word[i]=place: check if it is a prime number:
        - When j = 2 (word[j]=place), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (word[j]=place), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (word[j]=place), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (word[j]=place), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 6 (word[j]=place), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
    - word[i]=available: check if it is a prime number:
        - When j = 2 (word[j]=available), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (word[j]=available), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (word[j]=available), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (word[j]=available), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 6 (word[j]=available), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
    - word[i]=here: check if it is a prime number:
        - When j = 2 (word[j]=here), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (word[j]=here), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (word[j]=here), the condition `word[i] % j == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
