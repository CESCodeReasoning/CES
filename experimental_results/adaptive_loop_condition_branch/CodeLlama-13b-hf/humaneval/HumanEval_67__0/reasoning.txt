The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "2 apples and 3 oranges", n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `lis` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    - The character '2' is a digit, so it is appended to the list.
Iteration 2:
    - The character 'a' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 3:
    - The character 'p' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 4:
    - The character 'p' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 5:
    - The character 'l' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 6:
    - The character 'e' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 7:
    - The character 's' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 8:
    - The character ' ' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 9:
    - The character 'a' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 10:
    - The character 'n' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 11:
    - The character 'd' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 12:
    - The character ' ' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 13:
    - The character '3' is a digit, so it is appended to the list.
Iteration 14:
    - The character ' ' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 15:
    - The character 'o' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 16:
    - The character 'r' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 17:
    - The character 'a' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 18:
    - The character 'n' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 19:
    - The character 'g' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 20:
    - The character 'e' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.
Iteration 21:
    - The character 's' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the list.

The list `lis` now contains [2, 3].
The sum of the list is 5.
The difference between 5 and 5 is 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges",5)` is 0.
