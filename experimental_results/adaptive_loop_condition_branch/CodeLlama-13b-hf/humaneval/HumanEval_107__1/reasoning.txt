The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The number 1 is odd, so it is not a palindrome.
Iteration 2:
    - The number 2 is even, but it is not a palindrome.
Iteration 3:
    - The number 3 is odd, so it is not a palindrome.
Iteration 4:
    - The number 4 is even, but it is not a palindrome.
Iteration 5:
    - The number 5 is odd, so it is not a palindrome.
Iteration 6:
    - The number 6 is even, but it is not a palindrome.
Iteration 7:
    - The number 7 is odd, so it is not a palindrome.
Iteration 8:
    - The number 8 is even, but it is not a palindrome.
Iteration 9:
    - The number 9 is odd, so it is not a palindrome.
Iteration 10:
    - The number 10 is even, but it is not a palindrome.
