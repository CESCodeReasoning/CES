The function `factorize` is called with ( n = 3 * 2 * 3 ).
Inside the function, a variable `fact` is initialized to an empty list.
Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to 2.
The loop iterates from 2 through 3 (since ( n = 3 * 2 * 3 )).
First Iteration (i = 2):
    - i <= int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) when i=2
    - The conditin `n % i == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`fact.append(i)` updates `fact` to [2] ( [] + [2] = [2] ).
    -`n //= i` updates `n` to 3 ( 3 * 2 * 3 // 2 = 3 ).
Second Iteration (i = 3):
    - i <= int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) when i=3
    - The conditin `n % i == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`fact.append(i)` updates `fact` to [2, 3] ( [2] + [3] = [2, 3] ).
    -`n //= i` updates `n` to 1 ( 3 * 2 * 3 // 3 = 1 ).
After the loop completes, the condition `n > 1` is true. The first branch is taken.
`fact.append(n)` updates `fact` to [2, 3, 1] ( [2, 3] + [1] = [2, 3, 1] ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `fact`, which is now [2, 3, 1].
