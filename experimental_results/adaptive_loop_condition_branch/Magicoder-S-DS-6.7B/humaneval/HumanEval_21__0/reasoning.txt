The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of floating point numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is rescaled to the range [0, 1] by subtracting the minimum number and dividing by the range.

To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], we need to subtract the minimum number and divide by the range.

The minimum number in the input list is 1.0 and the maximum number is 5.0. Therefore, the rescaled numbers are:

1.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 = 0.0
2.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 = 0.25
3.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 = 0.5
4.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 = 0.75
5.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 = 1.0

The output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] is [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0].
