The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['())(', '()'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `S1` and `S2` are initialized to the concatenation of the first and second elements of the input list.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 0.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 0.

The function `check` returns `True` because `val` is 0 at the end of the first string.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 0.

The function `check` returns `True` because `val` is 0 at the end of the second string.

Therefore, the final output of the function `match_parens(['())(', '()'])` is 'Yes'.
