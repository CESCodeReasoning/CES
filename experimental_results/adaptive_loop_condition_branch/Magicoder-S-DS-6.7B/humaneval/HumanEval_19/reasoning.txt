The function sort_numbers takes a string of numbers in words as input and returns a string of the numbers sorted in ascending order.

The function first splits the input string into a list of words. Then, it filters out any empty strings from the list. After that, it sorts the list of words based on their corresponding numerical values in the value_map dictionary.

The value_map dictionary maps each word to its corresponding numerical value.

For example, if the input string is 'five zero four seven nine eight', the function will return 'zero four five seven eight nine'.

The output of executing the function sort_numbers on the input 'five zero four seven nine eight' is 'zero four five seven eight nine'.
