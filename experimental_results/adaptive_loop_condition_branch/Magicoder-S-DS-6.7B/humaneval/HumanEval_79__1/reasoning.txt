The function decimal_to_binary takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of the number.
To determine the output of executing the function decimal_to_binary on the input 103, we need to convert 103 from decimal to binary.

In Python, the built-in function bin() converts an integer number to a binary string. The binary string starts with "0b" to indicate that it's a binary number. We need to remove the first two characters "0b" to get the actual binary number.

So, the binary representation of 103 is 1100111.

We need to add "db" at the beginning and end of the binary string to get the final output.

Therefore, the output of executing the function decimal_to_binary on the input 103 is "db1100111db".
