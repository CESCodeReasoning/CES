The function `factorize` is called with ( n = 3 * 2 * 3 = 18 ).
Inside the function, a variable `fact` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 2 through the square root of 18 (since ( n = 18 )).
First Iteration (i = 2):
    - 18 % 2 == 0 when i=2
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `fact.append(i)` appends 2 to `fact`.
    - `n //= i` updates `n` to 9 ( 18 // 2 = 9 ).
Second Iteration (i = 3):
    - 9 % 3 == 0 when i=3
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
