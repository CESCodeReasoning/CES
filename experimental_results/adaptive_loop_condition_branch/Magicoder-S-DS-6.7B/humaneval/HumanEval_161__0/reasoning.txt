The function `solve` is called with ( s = "#a@C" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '#' is not an alphabet, so flg remains 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'a' is an alphabet, so flg becomes 1 and 'a' is converted to 'A'.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '@' is not an alphabet, so flg remains 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'C' is an alphabet, so flg remains 1 and 'C' is converted to 'c'.

After the loop, if flg is 0, the function returns the reverse of the string.
If flg is not 0, the function returns the string.
