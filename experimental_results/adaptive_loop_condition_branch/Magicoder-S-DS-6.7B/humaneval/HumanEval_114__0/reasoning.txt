The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [1, -1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is added to `s`, so `s` becomes 1.
    -Since `s` is not less than 0, `s` remains 1.
    -`max_sum` is updated to the maximum of `s` and `max_sum`, which is 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The number -1 is added to `s`, so `s` becomes 0.
    -Since `s` is less than 0, `s` is reset to 0.
    -`max_sum` is updated to the maximum of `s` and `max_sum`, which is 0.

Since `max_sum` is 0, the function returns the maximum negative number in `nums`, which is -1.
