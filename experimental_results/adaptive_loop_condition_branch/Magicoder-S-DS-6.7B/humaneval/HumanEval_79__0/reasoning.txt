The function decimal_to_binary takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of the number.
To determine the output of executing the function decimal_to_binary on the input 32, we need to convert the decimal number 32 to binary.
The bin function in Python converts an integer number to a binary string. The binary string starts with "0b" to indicate that it's a binary number. We need to remove the first two characters "0b" to get the actual binary number.
Therefore, the output of executing the function decimal_to_binary on the input 32 is "db100000db".
