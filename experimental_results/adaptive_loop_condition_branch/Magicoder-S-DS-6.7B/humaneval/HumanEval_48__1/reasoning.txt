The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'aaaaa' ).
The function iterates over the string from the first character to the middle character.

Iteration 1:
    -The first character 'a' is compared with the last character 'a'. They are the same, so the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 2:
    -The second character 'a' is compared with the second last character 'a'. They are the same, so the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 3:
    -The third character 'a' is compared with the third last character 'a'. They are the same, so the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth character 'a' is compared with the fourth last character 'a'. They are the same, so the function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 5:
    -The fifth character 'a' is compared with the fifth last character 'a'. They are the same, so the function continues to the next iteration.

The function returns True, indicating that the string is a palindrome.
