The function `largest_prime_factor` is called with ( n = 15 ).
Inside the function, a variable `largest` is initialized to 1.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 2 is a factor of 15 and is a prime number, so largest becomes 2.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 3 is a factor of 15 and is a prime number, so largest becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 4 is a factor of 15 but not a prime number, so largest remains 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 5 is a factor of 15 and is a prime number, so largest becomes 5.
Iteration 5:
    -The number 6 is a factor of 15 but not a prime number, so largest remains 5.
Iteration 6:
    -The number 7 is a factor of 15 and is a prime number, so largest becomes 7.
Iteration 7:
    -The number 8 is a factor of 15 but not a prime number, so largest remains 7.
Iteration 8:
    -The number 9 is a factor of 15 but not a prime number, so largest remains 7.
Iteration 9:
    -The number 10 is a factor of 15 but not a prime number, so largest remains 7.
Iteration 10:
    -The number 11 is a factor of 15 and is a prime number, so largest becomes 11.
Iteration 11:
    -The number 12 is a factor of 15 but not a prime number, so largest remains 11.
Iteration 12:
    -The number 13 is a factor of 15 and is a prime number, so largest becomes 13.
Iteration 13:
    -The number 14 is a factor of 15 but not a prime number, so largest remains 13.
Iteration 14:
    -The number 15 is a factor of 15 and is a prime number, so largest becomes 15.

Therefore, the final output of the function `largest_prime_factor(15)` is 15.
