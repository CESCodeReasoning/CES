The function filter_integers takes a list of values as input and returns a new list that contains only the integers from the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [4, {}, [], 23.2, 9, 'adasd'], we need to filter out the integers from the list.

The integers in the input list are 4, 9. Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [4, {}, [], 23.2, 9, 'adasd'] is [4, 9].
