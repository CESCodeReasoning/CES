The function `is_sorted` is called with ( lst = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `count_digit` is initialized with each element of `lst` as a key and 0 as its value.
The loop iterates over `lst`.
First Iteration (i = 1):
    count_digit[1] += 1 updates `count_digit` to {1: 1}.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    count_digit[2] += 1 updates `count_digit` to {1: 1, 2: 1}.
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    count_digit[3] += 1 updates `count_digit` to {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}.
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
    count_digit[4] += 1 updates `count_digit` to {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}.
After the loop completes, the condition ( any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst) ) is not satisfied, so the if branch is not taken.
The condition ( all(lst[i - 1] <= lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst))) ) is satisfied, so the if branch is taken and the function returns `True` as the output.
