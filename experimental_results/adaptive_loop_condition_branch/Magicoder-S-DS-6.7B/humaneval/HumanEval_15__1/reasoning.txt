The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string. The string is a sequence of numbers from 0 to n, separated by spaces.

To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 10, we need to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 10, convert each number to a string, and then join them together with spaces.

The sequence of numbers from 0 to 10 is: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

After converting each number to a string, the sequence becomes: "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10".

Finally, we join these strings together with spaces to get the output: "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10".
