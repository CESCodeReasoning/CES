The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with ( n = 123 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is odd and not a palindrome, so odd_palindrome_count remains 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 2 is even and not a palindrome, so even_palindrome_count remains 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 3 is odd and not a palindrome, so odd_palindrome_count remains 0.
