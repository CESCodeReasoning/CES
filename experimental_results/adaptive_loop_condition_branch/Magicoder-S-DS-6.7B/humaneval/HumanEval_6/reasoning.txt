The function `parse_nested_parens` is called with ( paren_string = '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())' ).
The function `parse_nested_parens` splits the input string into a list of strings, where each string is a group of parentheses.

Iteration 1:
    -The string '(()())' is passed to `parse_paren_group`.
    -The function `parse_paren_group` iterates over the characters in the string.
    -The character '(' is found, so depth is incremented to 1 and max_depth is updated to 1.
    -The character '(' is found, so depth is incremented to 2 and max_depth is updated to 2.
    -The character ')' is found, so depth is decremented to 1.
    -The character ')' is found, so depth is decremented to 0.
    -The function `parse_paren_group` returns 2.

Iteration 2:
    -The string '((()))' is passed to `parse_paren_group`.
    -The function `parse_paren_group` iterates over the characters in the string.
    -The character '(' is found, so depth is incremented to 1 and max_depth is updated to 1.
    -The character '(' is found, so depth is incremented to 2 and max_depth is updated to 2.
    -The character ')' is found, so depth is decremented to 1.
    -The character ')' is found, so depth is decremented to 0.
    -The character ')' is found, so depth is decremented to -1.
    -The function `parse_paren_group` returns 2.

Iteration 3:
    -The string '' is passed to `parse_paren_group`.
    -The function `parse_paren_group` iterates over the characters in the string.
    -The function `parse_paren_group` returns 0.

Iteration 4:
    -The string '((())()())' is passed to `parse_paren_group`.
    -The function `parse_paren_group` iterates over the characters in the string.
    -The character '(' is found, so depth is incremented to 1 and max_depth is updated to 1.
    -The character '(' is found, so depth is incremented to 2 and max_depth is updated to 2.
    -The character '(' is found, so depth is incremented to 3 and max_depth is updated to 3.
    -The character ')' is found, so depth is decremented to 2.
    -The character ')' is found, so depth is decremented to 1.
    -The character ')' is found, so depth is decremented to 0.
    -The function `parse_paren_group` returns 3.

The function `parse_nested_parens` returns a list of integers [2, 2, 0, 3].
