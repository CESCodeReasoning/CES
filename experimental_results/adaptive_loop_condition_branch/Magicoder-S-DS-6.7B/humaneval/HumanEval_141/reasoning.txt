The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = "example.txt" ).
The file name is "example.txt".
The file name is split into two parts using the period as the separator.
The length of the split list is 2, which satisfies ( len(lst) != 2 ).
The second part of the split list (i.e., the file extension) is "txt", which is in the list of allowed file extensions (suf).
The first part of the split list (i.e., the file name) is "example", which is not empty.
The first character of the file name is "e", which is an alphabet.
The number of digits in the file name is 0, which is less than or equal to 3.
Therefore, the function returns 'Yes'.
