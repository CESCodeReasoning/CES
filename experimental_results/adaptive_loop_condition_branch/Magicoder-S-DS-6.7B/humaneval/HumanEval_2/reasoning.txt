The function truncate_number takes a float number as input and returns the remainder of the number divided by 1.0.
To determine the output of executing the function truncate_number on the input 3.5, we need to find the remainder of 3.5 divided by 1.0.
The modulus operator (%) in Python returns the remainder of the division of the number to its left by the number to its right.
So, 3.5 % 1.0 = 0.5.
Therefore, the output of executing the function truncate_number on the input 3.5 is 0.5.
