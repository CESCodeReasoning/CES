The function make_a_pile takes an integer n as input and returns a list of integers. The list is created by adding 2*i to n for each i in the range from 0 to n-1.
To determine the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 3, we need to create a list of numbers where each number is the sum of 2*i and 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 3 is [3, 5, 7].
