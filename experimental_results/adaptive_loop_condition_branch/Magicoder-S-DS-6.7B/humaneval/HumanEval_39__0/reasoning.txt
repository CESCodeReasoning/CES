    - The condition `p % k == 0` is false for all k.
    - The function `is_prime` returns True.
    - n is decremented by 1.
Eighth Iteration:
    - The Fibonacci number is 21.
    - The function `is_prime` is called with ( p = 21 ).
    - The condition `p < 2` is false.
    - The loop iterates from 2 through the square root of 21 (since ( p = 21 )).
    - The condition `p % k == 0` is false for all k.
    - The function `is_prime` returns False.
    - n is not decremented.
