The function `check_dict_case` is called with ( dict = {"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"} ).
Inside the function, a variable `state` is initialized to "start".

Iteration 1:
    -The key 'Name' is a string and is uppercase, so `state` becomes "upper".
Iteration 2:
    -The key 'Age' is a string and is lowercase, so `state` remains "upper".
Iteration 3:
    -The key 'City' is a string and is uppercase, so `state` remains "upper".

The function returns True, indicating that the keys in the dictionary are all either uppercase or lowercase.
