The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [123, -123, 20, 0 , 1, 2, -3], k = 3 ).
The condition `k == 0` is false, so the else branch is taken.
The array is sorted in ascending order, resulting in `arr = [-123, -3, 0, 1, 2, 20, 123]`.
The last `k` elements of the sorted array are taken, which are `[20, 123, 123]`.
Therefore, the final output of the function `maximum([123, -123, 20, 0 , 1, 2, -3], 3)` is `[20, 123, 123]`.
