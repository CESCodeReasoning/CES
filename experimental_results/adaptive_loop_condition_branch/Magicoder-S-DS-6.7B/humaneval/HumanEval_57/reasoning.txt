The function `monotonic` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 4, 10] ).
The list `l` is [1, 2, 4, 10].
The condition `l == sorted(l)` is False, as the list is not sorted in ascending order.
The condition `l == sorted(l, reverse=True)` is also False, as the list is not sorted in descending order.
Therefore, the function returns False.
