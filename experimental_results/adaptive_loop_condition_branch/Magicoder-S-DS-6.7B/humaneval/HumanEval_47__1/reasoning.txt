The function `median` is called with ( l = [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20] ).
The list is sorted in ascending order, resulting in [-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000].
The length of the list is 6, which is an odd number.
The condition `len(l) % 2 == 1` is true, so the if branch is taken.
The median is the middle number in the sorted list. Since the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element.
The middle element is at index len(l) // 2 = 6 // 2 = 3.
The element at index 3 is 10.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])` is 10.
