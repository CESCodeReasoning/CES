The function `longest` is called with ( strings = ['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc'] ).
The condition `not strings` is false, so the function proceeds to the next line.
The `maxlen` variable is set to the maximum length of the strings in the list.
Iteration 1:
    -The string 'x' is not the longest string, so the function continues to the next string.
Iteration 2:
    -The string 'yyy' is the longest string, so the function returns 'yyy'.
