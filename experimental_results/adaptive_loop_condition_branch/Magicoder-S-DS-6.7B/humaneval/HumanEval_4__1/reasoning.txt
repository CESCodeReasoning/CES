The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers.

The mean absolute deviation (MAD) is a measure of the variability of a data set. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences from the mean.

To calculate the mean absolute deviation, we first calculate the mean of the numbers. Then, for each number in the list, we calculate its absolute difference from the mean and add it to the total. Finally, we divide the total by the number of elements in the list to get the mean absolute deviation.

For the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], the mean is 3.0. The absolute differences from the mean are [2.0, 1.0, 0.0, -1.0, -2.0]. The sum of these differences is 0.0. Therefore, the mean absolute deviation is 0.0.
