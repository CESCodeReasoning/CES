The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "abcde" ).
The string "abcde" is iterated over.
The condition `c in vowels` is checked for each character in the string.
The condition `s[-1] == 'y' or s[-1] == 'Y'` is checked.
The last character of the string is 'e', which is not a vowel.
Therefore, the function returns the count of vowels in the string, which is 1.
