The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple of the largest negative number and the smallest positive number in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [-1, -3, -5, -6], we need to filter out the negative numbers and the positive numbers from the list. Then, find the maximum of the negative numbers and the minimum of the positive numbers.

The negative numbers in the list are -1, -3, -5, -6. The maximum of these is -1.

The positive numbers in the list are none. There is no smallest positive number.

Therefore, the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [-1, -3, -5, -6] is (-1, None).
