The function `count_nums` is called with ( arr = [1] ).
The inner function `digits_sum` is called with ( n = 1 ).
`n` is 1, which is not less than 0.
The condition `n < 0` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
`n` is converted to a list of digits.
The first digit is multiplied by the sign of `n`.
The sum of the digits is returned.
The function `digits_sum` returns 1.
The function `count_nums` filters the list of sums to only include positive numbers.
The length of the filtered list is returned.

Therefore, the final output of the function `count_nums([1])` is 1.
