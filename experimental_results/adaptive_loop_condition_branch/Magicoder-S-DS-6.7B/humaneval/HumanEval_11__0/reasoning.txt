The function `string_xor` is called with ( a = '1', b = '1' ).
The inner function `xor` is defined.
The zip function is used to iterate over two strings simultaneously.
The first iteration (x = '1', y = '1')
   - `x` and `y` are both '1', which satisfies ( x == y ).
   - The condition `x == y` is true.
   - Action: `xor(x, y)` returns '0'.
The second iteration (x = ' ', y = ' ')
   - `x` and `y` are both ' ', which does not satisfy ( x == y ).
   - The condition `x == y` is false.
   - Action: `xor(x, y)` returns '1'.
Therefore, the final output of the function `string_xor('1', '1')` is '01'.
