The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and checks if n is even (i.e., n % 2 == 0) and if n is greater than or equal to 8. If both conditions are true, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 13, we need to check if 13 is even and is greater than or equal to 8.

13 is not even (13 % 2 != 0), so the first condition is not met.

13 is not greater than or equal to 8 (13 >= 8), so the second condition is not met.

Therefore, the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 13 is False.
