The function right_angle_triangle checks if a, b, and c can form a right-angled triangle. A right-angled triangle is a triangle where the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

To determine if a, b, and c can form a right-angled triangle, we need to check if any of the following conditions is true:

1. a^2 = b^2 + c^2
2. b^2 = a^2 + c^2
3. c^2 = a^2 + b^2

If any of these conditions is true, then a, b, and c can form a right-angled triangle.

For the input (1, 1, 1), we can see that a^2 = b^2 + c^2 is true, so the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input (1, 1, 1) is True.
