The function `digits` is called with ( n = 5576543 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1 and `odd_count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The digit '5' is odd, so product becomes 5 and odd_count becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The digit '5' is odd, so product becomes 25 and odd_count becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The digit '7' is odd, so product becomes 175 and odd_count becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The digit '6' is even, so no change in product and no change in odd_count.
Iteration 5:
    -The digit '5' is odd, so product becomes 5400 and odd_count becomes 4.
Iteration 6:
    -The digit '4' is even, so no change in product and no change in odd_count.
Iteration 7:
    -The digit '3' is odd, so product becomes 15600 and odd_count becomes 5.

After the loop, the function checks if odd_count is 0. Since it is not, it returns the product, which is 15600.
