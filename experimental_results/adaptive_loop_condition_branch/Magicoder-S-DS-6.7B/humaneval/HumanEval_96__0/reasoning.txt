The function count_up_to(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates from 2 to n (exclusive) to check each number if it is a prime number.
In the inner loop, for each number i in the outer loop, check if it is divisible by any number from 2 to i-1.
First Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 2.
    - 2 is not divisible by any number from 2 to 1, so it is a prime number. Append 2 to primes.
Second Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 2 and 3.
    - 3 is not divisible by any number from 2 to 2, so it is a prime number. Append 3 to primes.
Third Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 2 and 3.
    - 4 is divisible by 2, so it is not a prime number.
Fourth Iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, j in the inner loop is 2, 3 and 4.
    - 5 is not divisible by any number from 2 to 3, so it is a prime number. Append 5 to primes.
Fifth Iteration (i=6):
    - `i` is 6, j in the inner loop is 2, 3 and 4.
    - 6 is divisible by 2, so it is not a prime number.
Sixth Iteration (i=7):
    - `i` is 7, j in the inner loop is 2, 3 and 4.
    - 7 is not divisible by any number from 2 to 3, so it is a prime number. Append 7 to primes.
Seventh Iteration (i=8):
    - `i` is 8, j in the inner loop is 2, 3 and 4.
    - 8 is divisible by 2, so it is not a prime number.
Eighth Iteration (i=9):
    - `i` is 9, j in the inner loop is 2, 3 and 4.
    - 9 is divisible by 3, so it is not a prime number.
Ninth Iteration (i=10):
    - `i` is 10, j in the inner loop is 2, 3 and 4.
    - 10 is divisible by 2, so it is not a prime number.
Tenth Iteration (i=11):
    - `i` is 11, j in the inner loop is 2, 3 and 4.
    - 11 is not divisible by any number from 2 to 3, so it is a prime number. Append 11 to primes.
Eleventh Iteration (i=12):
    - `i` is 12, j in the inner loop is 2, 3 and 4.
    - 12 is divisible by 2, so it is not a prime number.
Twelfth Iteration (i=13):
    - `i` is 13, j in the inner loop is 2, 3 and 4.
    - 13 is not divisible by any number from 2 to 3, so it is a prime number. Append 13 to primes.
Thirteenth Iteration (i=14):
    - `i` is 14, j in the inner loop is 2, 3 and 4.
    - 14 is divisible by 2, so it is not a prime number.
Fourteenth Iteration (i=15):
    - `i` is 15, j in the inner loop is 2, 3 and 4.
    - 15 is divisible by 3, so it is not a prime number.
Fifteenth Iteration (i=16):
    - `i` is 16, j in the inner loop is 2, 3 and 4.
    - 16 is divisible by 2, so it is not a prime number.
Sixteenth Iteration (i=17):
    - `i` is 17, j in the inner loop is 2, 3 and 4.
    - 17 is not divisible by any number from 2 to 3, so it is a prime number. Append 17 to primes.
Seventeenth Iteration (i=18):
    - `i` is 18, j in the inner loop is 2, 3 and 4.
    - 18 is divisible by 2, so it is not a prime number.
