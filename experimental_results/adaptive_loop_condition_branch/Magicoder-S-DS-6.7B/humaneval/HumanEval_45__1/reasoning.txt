The function triangle_area calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height.
To determine the area of a triangle with a base of 2 and a height of 2, we need to multiply the base by the height and then divide by 2.
Therefore, the area of the triangle with a base of 2 and a height of 2 is 2 * 2 / 2 = 2.
