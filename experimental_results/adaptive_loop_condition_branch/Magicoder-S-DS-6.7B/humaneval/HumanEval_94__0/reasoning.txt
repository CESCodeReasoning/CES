The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [127, 97, 8192] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the list `lst`.
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is true.
    - The function `isPrime` is called with ( n = 127 ).
    - The loop iterates from 2 through the square root of 127 (since ( n = 127 )).
    - The condition `(127 % i == 0)` is false for all i in the range.
    - The function `isPrime` returns True.
    - `maxx` is updated to 127.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is true.
    - The function `isPrime` is called with ( n = 97 ).
    - The loop iterates from 2 through the square root of 97 (since ( n = 97 )).
    - The condition `(97 % i == 0)` is false for all i in the range.
    - The function `isPrime` returns True.
    - `maxx` is updated to 97.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is false.
    - The function `isPrime` is called with ( n = 8192 ).
    - The loop iterates from 2 through the square root of 8192 (since ( n = 8192 )).
    - The condition `(8192 % i == 0)` is true for i = 2.
    - The function `isPrime` returns False.
    - `maxx` remains 97.
After the loop completes, the function converts `maxx` to a string, iterates through each digit, converts it back to an integer, and sums them up.
The final output of the function `skjkasdkd([127, 97, 8192])` is 16.
