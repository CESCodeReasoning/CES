The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 2 is added to `s`, which becomes -2.
    -Since `s` is not less than 0, `s` remains 0.
    -`max_sum` remains 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 3 is added to `s`, which becomes -5.
    -Since `s` is less than 0, `s` becomes 0.
    -`max_sum` remains 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 4 is added to `s`, which becomes -9.
    -Since `s` is less than 0, `s` becomes 0.
    -`max_sum` remains 0.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 1 is added to `s`, which becomes -10.
    -Since `s` is less than 0, `s` becomes 0.
    -`max_sum` remains 0.
Iteration 5:
    -The number 2 is added to `s`, which becomes -12.
    -Since `s` is less than 0, `s` becomes 0.
    -`max_sum` remains 0.
Iteration 6:
    -The number 4 is added to `s`, which becomes -16.
    -Since `s` is less than 0, `s` becomes 0.
    -`max_sum` remains 0.

After the loop, `max_sum` remains 0.

Since `max_sum` is 0, the condition `max_sum == 0` is true.

The `else` block is executed, and `min_sum` is set to -`max_sum`, which is -0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4])` is 0.
