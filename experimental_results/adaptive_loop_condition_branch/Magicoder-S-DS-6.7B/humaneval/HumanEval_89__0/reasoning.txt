The function `encrypt` is called with ( s = 'et' ).
Inside the function, a variable `out` is initialized to an empty string.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'e' is in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', so it is shifted 2 places to the right (which is 'g').
Iteration 2:
    -The character 't' is not in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', so it is not changed.
