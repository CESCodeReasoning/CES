The function `intersection` is called with ( interval1 = [-2, -2], interval2 = [-3, -2] ).
The function `is_prime` is called with ( num = length ).

The function `is_prime` checks if a number is prime.
Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is not prime, so it returns False.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 2 is prime, so it returns True.

The function `intersection` calculates the intersection of two intervals.
Iteration 1:
    -The maximum of the two left endpoints is -2.
    -The minimum of the two right endpoints is -2.
    -The length of the intersection is 0.
    -The length is not greater than 0 or not a prime number, so it returns "NO".
