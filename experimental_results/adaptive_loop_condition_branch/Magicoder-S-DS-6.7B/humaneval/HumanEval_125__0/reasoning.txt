The function `split_words` is called with ( txt = "" ).
The condition `" " in txt` is False, the first branch is not taken.
The condition `"," in txt` is also False, the second branch is not taken.
The `else` block's action: `len([i for i in txt if i.islower() and ord(i) % 2 == 0])` returns the length of the list of lowercase letters with even ASCII values in `txt`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `split_words("")` is 0.
