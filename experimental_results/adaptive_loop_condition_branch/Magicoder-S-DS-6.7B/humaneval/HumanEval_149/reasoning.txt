The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["aa", "a", "aaa"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of 'a' is 1, which is not even.
Iteration 2:
    -The length of 'aa' is 2, which is even. So, 'aa' is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The length of 'aaa' is 3, which is not even.

After the loop, `new_lst` is sorted by length and returned.
