The function `move_one_ball` is called with ( arr = [4, 3, 1, 2] ).
The function checks if the length of the array is 0.
    - The length of the array is not 0, so it proceeds to the next step.
The function sorts the array and stores it in `sorted_array`.
The function finds the minimum value in the array and its index.
The function rearranges the array so that the minimum value is at the beginning.
The function checks if the rearranged array is the same as the sorted array.
    - The first element of the rearranged array is not equal to the first element of the sorted array.
    - The second element of the rearranged array is equal to the second element of the sorted array.
    - The third element of the rearranged array is equal to the third element of the sorted array.
    - The fourth element of the rearranged array is equal to the fourth element of the sorted array.
    - Therefore, the function returns False.
