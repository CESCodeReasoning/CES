The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [3, 2, -3.5, 0] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list.

Iteration 1:
    -The element 3 is greater than the initial value of m, so m becomes 3.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 2 is not greater than 3, so m remains 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The element -3.5 is less than 3, so m remains 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The element 0 is less than 3, so m remains 3.

So, the maximum element in the list is 3.
