The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "bYe" ).
The string "bYe" ends with 'y' or 'Y'.
The condition `s[-1] == 'y' or s[-1] == 'Y'` is true.
The if branch is taken and the method returns `n_vowels` which is the count of vowels in the string "bYe" plus 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("bYe")` is 1.
