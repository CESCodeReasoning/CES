The function sort_third takes a list l as input and sorts every third element in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], we need to sort every third element in the list.

The list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] has the following elements:
- The third element is 2
- The sixth element is 3
- The ninth element is 123

After sorting these elements, the list becomes [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10].

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] is [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10].
