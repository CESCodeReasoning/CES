The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [3,2,3,100,3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None and `result` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 3 is greater than None, so running_max becomes 3.
    -The running_max (3) is appended to the result list.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 2 is less than 3, so running_max remains 3.
    -The running_max (3) is appended to the result list.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 3 is greater than 3, so running_max becomes 3.
    -The running_max (3) is appended to the result list.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 100 is greater than 3, so running_max becomes 100.
    -The running_max (100) is appended to the result list.
Iteration 5:
    -The number 3 is less than 100, so running_max remains 100.
    -The running_max (100) is appended to the result list.

The final output of the function `rolling_max([3,2,3,100,3])` is [3,3,3,100,100].
