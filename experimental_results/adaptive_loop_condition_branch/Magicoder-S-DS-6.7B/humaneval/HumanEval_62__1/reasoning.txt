The function derivative takes a list of numbers xs as input and returns a list of the derivatives of the input list.

The derivative of a function at a point is the limit of the difference quotient as the increment of the point tends to zero. In this case, the derivative of a function at a point is the slope of the tangent line at that point.

The derivative of a constant function is zero. The derivative of a linear function is the constant of the function.

For example, the derivative of the function y = 3x + 2 at the point x = 1 is 3.

The derivative of a function at a point is calculated by multiplying the coefficient of the highest degree term by the power of the term minus one.

In the list [3, 2, 1], the derivative is calculated as follows:

- The derivative of the first term is 3 * 0 = 0
- The derivative of the second term is 2 * 1 = 2
- The derivative of the third term is 1 * 2 = 2

So, the derivative of the function represented by the list [3, 2, 1] is [0, 2].

The function derivative returns the derivative of the input list, excluding the first element (since the derivative of a constant function is zero).

Therefore, the output of executing the function derivative on the input [3, 2, 1] is [2].
