The function `factorize` is called with ( n = 3 * 19 * 3 * 19 ).
Inside the function, a variable `fact` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 2 through the square root of n (since the square root of n is the largest possible factor).
First Iteration (i = 2):
    - n % i == 0 when n=3 * 19 * 3 * 19
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `fact.append(i)` appends 2 to `fact`.
    - `n //= i` updates `n` to 3 * 19 * 3 * 19 / 2 = 3 * 19 * 3 * 19.
Second Iteration (i = 3):
