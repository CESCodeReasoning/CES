The function `Strongest_Extension` is called with ( class_name = 'Sp', extensions = ['671235', 'Bb'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `strong` is initialized to the first element of the `extensions` list.

Iteration 1:
    -The string '671235' has 0 uppercase letters and 5 lowercase letters, so `my_val` becomes -5.
Iteration 2:
    -The string 'Bb' has 2 uppercase letters and 0 lowercase letters, so `my_val` becomes 2.

Since 'Bb' has more uppercase letters than lowercase letters, `strong` becomes 'Bb'.

The final output of the function `Strongest_Extension('Sp', ['671235', 'Bb'])` is 'Sp.Bb'.
