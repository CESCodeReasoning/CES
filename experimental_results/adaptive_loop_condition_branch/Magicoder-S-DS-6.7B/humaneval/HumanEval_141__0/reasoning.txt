The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = 'I563_No.exe' ).
The file name is split into two parts using the period as the separator.
The first condition checks if the length of the split list is not equal to 2.
The second condition checks if the second part of the split list is not in the list of allowed suffixes.
The third condition checks if the first part of the split list is empty.
The fourth condition checks if the first character of the first part of the split list is not a letter.
The fifth condition checks if the number of digits in the first part of the split list is greater than 3.
If any of these conditions are true, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `file_name_check('I563_No.exe')` is 'No'.
