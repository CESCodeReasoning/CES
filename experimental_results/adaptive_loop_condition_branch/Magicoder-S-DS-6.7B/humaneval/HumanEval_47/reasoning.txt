The function `median` is called with ( l = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5] ).
The list is sorted in ascending order, resulting in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The length of the list is 5, which is odd.
The condition `len(l) % 2 == 1` is true, so the if branch is taken.
The median is the middle number in the sorted list, which is at index `len(l) // 2`.
The middle number is 3, so the function returns 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])` is 3.
