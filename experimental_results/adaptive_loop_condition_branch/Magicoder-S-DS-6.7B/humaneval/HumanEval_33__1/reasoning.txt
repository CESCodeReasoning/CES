The function sort_third takes a list l as input and sorts every third element in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10], we need to sort every third element in the list.

The list [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10] has the following elements:
- The third element is 4.
- The sixth element is 2.
- The ninth element is 12.

After sorting these elements, the list becomes [5, 8, -12, 2, 4, 23, 3, 11, -10, 12].

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10] is [5, 8, -12, 2, 4, 23, 3, 11, -10, 12].
