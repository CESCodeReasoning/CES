The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Hello' ).
The length of the string is 5.

Iteration 1:
    -The length 5 is not divisible by 2, so it is not a prime number.
Iteration 2:
    -The length 5 is not divisible by 3, so it is not a prime number.
Iteration 3:
    -The length 5 is not divisible by 4, so it is not a prime number.
Iteration 4:
    -The length 5 is not divisible by 5, so it is not a prime number.

Therefore, the final output of the function `prime_length('Hello')` is False.
