The function sort_third takes a list l as input and sorts every third element in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to sort every third element in the list.
The list [1, 2, 3] has no third element, so the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3].
