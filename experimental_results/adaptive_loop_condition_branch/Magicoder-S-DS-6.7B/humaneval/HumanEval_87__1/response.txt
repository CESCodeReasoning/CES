<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.
@@ Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def get_row(lst, x):
    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst))
              for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
    return sorted(
        sorted(
            coords,
            key=lambda x: x[1],
            reverse=True),
        key=lambda x: x[0])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3)
[/INPUT]
@@ Response
[REASONING]
The function get_row takes a 2D list lst and a number x as input. It returns a sorted list of tuples where each tuple represents the coordinates of the number x in the 2D list.

To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3, we need to find the coordinates of the number 3 in the 2D list.

The 2D list is [[], [1], [1, 2, 3]]. The number 3 is at the coordinates (2, 2) in the 2D list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3 is [(2, 2)].
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[(2, 2)]
