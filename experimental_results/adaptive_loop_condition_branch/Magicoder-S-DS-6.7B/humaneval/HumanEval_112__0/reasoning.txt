The function reverse_delete takes a string s and a string c as input. It first removes all occurrences of characters in c from s. Then it checks if the resulting string is the same when reversed.

For the input "abcdedcba","v", the function will remove all occurrences of 'v' from "abcdedcba" to get "abcdecdba". Then it checks if the resulting string "abcdecdba" is the same when reversed.

The reversed string of "abcdecdba" is "abcdedcba". Therefore, the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcdedcba","v" is ("abcdecdba", True).
