The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "1/5", n = "5/1" ).
The function splits the input strings `x` and `n` by "/" to get the numerator and denominator of the fractions.
The numerator of the first fraction is multiplied by the denominator of the second fraction, and the result is compared with the numerator of the second fraction multiplied by the denominator of the first fraction.
If the result of the multiplication is an integer, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.

The numerator of the first fraction is 1 and the denominator is 5.
The numerator of the second fraction is 5 and the denominator is 1.
The multiplication of the numerators gives 5, which is an integer.
The multiplication of the denominators gives 5, which is an integer.
Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("1/5", "5/1")` is True.
