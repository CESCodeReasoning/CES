The function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter takes a string txt as input and checks if the last character in the string is a letter.

To determine the output of executing the function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter on the input "apple", we need to split the string into words and check the last word. Then, we need to check if the last word has only one character and if that character is a letter.

The last word in "apple" is "apple". The last word has only one character, which is "a". The ASCII value of "a" is 97, and the ASCII value of "z" is 122. Therefore, "a" is a letter.

Therefore, the output of executing the function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter on the input "apple" is True.
