The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'xywyx' ).
The function iterates over the string from the start to the end.

Iteration 1:
    -The character at index 0 is 'x' and the character at index len(text) - 1 - i = 5 - 0 - 1 = 4 is 'x'. They are the same, so the condition is not met.
Iteration 2:
    -The character at index 1 is 'y' and the character at index len(text) - 1 - i = 5 - 1 - 1 = 3 is 'w'. They are not the same, so the function returns False.

Therefore, the function `is_palindrome('xywyx')` returns False.
