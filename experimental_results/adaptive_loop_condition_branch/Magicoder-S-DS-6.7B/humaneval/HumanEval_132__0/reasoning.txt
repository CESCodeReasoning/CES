The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = '[][][[]]' ).
Inside the function, two empty lists `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` are initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '[' is found, so it is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character ']' is found, so it is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '[' is found, so it is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '[' is found, so it is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ']' is found, so it is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ']' is found, so it is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ']' is found, so it is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.

After the loop, `closing_bracket_index` is reversed.

Iteration 1:
    -The first index in `opening_bracket_index` is less than the first index in `closing_bracket_index`, so `cnt` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second index in `opening_bracket_index` is less than the second index in `closing_bracket_index`, so `cnt` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The third index in `opening_bracket_index` is less than the third index in `closing_bracket_index`, so `cnt` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_nested('[][][[]]')` is True.
