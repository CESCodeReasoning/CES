The function `fix_spaces` is called with ( text = "Exa   mple" ).
Inside the function, a variable `new_text` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates over the characters in the input string.
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - text[i] == " " when text[0]="E"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "E" ( "" + "E" = "E" ).
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - text[i] == " " when text[1]="x"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Ex" ( "E" + "x" = "Ex" ).
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - text[i] == " " when text[2]="a"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Exa" ( "Ex" + "a" = "Exa" ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - text[i] == " " when text[3]=" "
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The if branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 4 ( 3 + 1 = 4 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - text[i] == " " when text[4]=" "
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The if branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 5 ( 4 + 1 = 5 ).
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - text[i] == " " when text[5]=" "
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The if branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 6 ( 5 + 1 = 6 ).
Seventh Iteration (i = 6):
    - text[i] == " " when text[6]=" "
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The if branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 7 ( 6 + 1 = 7 ).
Eighth Iteration (i = 7):
    - text[i] == " " when text[7]="m"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Exa_mple" ( "Exa" + "m" = "Exa_mple" ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `new_text`, which is now "Exa_mple".
