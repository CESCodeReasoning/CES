The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input and returns the second smallest number in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we need to sort the list in ascending order and then return the second element.

First, we sort the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to get [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Then, we remove duplicates from the sorted list to get [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Finally, we check if the length of the list is less than 2. If it is, we return None. Otherwise, we return the second element of the list which is 2.

Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 2.
