The function `sort_even` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3] ).
The list `l` is sliced into two lists: `evens` and `odds`.
`evens` is a list of every other element in `l` (starting from the first element), and `odds` is a list of every other element in `l` (starting from the second element).
`evens` is sorted in ascending order.
The function then iterates over `evens` and `odds` simultaneously, appending each even and odd element to `ans`.
If the length of `evens` is greater than the length of `odds`, the last element of `evens` is appended to `ans`.
The function returns `ans` as a tuple.
