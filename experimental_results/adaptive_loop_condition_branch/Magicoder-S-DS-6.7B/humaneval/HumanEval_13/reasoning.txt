The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 3, b = 7 ).
Inside the function, a while loop is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
First Iteration:
    - a = 3, b = 7, a % b = 3.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 7 and b to 3.
Second Iteration:
    - a = 7, b = 3, a % b = 1.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 3 and b to 1.
b becomes 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 1.
