The function `how_many_times` is called with ( string = '', substring = 'x' ).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0.

The loop iterates from 0 through the length of the string minus the length of the substring plus 1.

The function checks if the substring is equal to the substring of the string from the current index to the length of the substring.

Since the string is empty, the loop does not execute.

The function returns the value of `times`, which is still 0.
