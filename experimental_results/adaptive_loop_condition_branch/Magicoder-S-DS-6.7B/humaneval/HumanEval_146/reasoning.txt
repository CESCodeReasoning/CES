The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [5, -2, 1, -5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 5 is greater than 10, so it checks if the first and last digit of the number are odd.
    -The first digit of 5 is 5, which is not an odd number.
    -The last digit of 5 is 5, which is not an odd number.
    -So, it does not increment the count.
Iteration 2:
    -The number -2 is not greater than 10, so it does not increment the count.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 1 is not greater than 10, so it does not increment the count.
Iteration 4:
    -The number -5 is not greater than 10, so it does not increment the count.

So, the final output of the function `specialFilter([5, -2, 1, -5])` is 0.
