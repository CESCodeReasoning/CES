The function `compare_one` is called with ( a = 5, b = 6 ).
The condition `isinstance(temp_a, str)` is false, so the if branch is not taken.
The condition `isinstance(temp_b, str)` is false, so the if branch is not taken.
The condition `float(temp_a) == float(temp_b)` is false, so the if branch is not taken.
The function returns `a`, which is 5.

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one(5, 6)` is 5.
