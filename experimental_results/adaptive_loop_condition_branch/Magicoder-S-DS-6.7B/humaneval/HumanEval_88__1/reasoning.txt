The function sort_array takes an array as input and returns an empty array if the length of the array is 0. Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order.

The condition (array[0] + array[-1]) % 2 == 0 checks if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even. If it is, the array is sorted in descending order; otherwise, it is sorted in ascending order.

For the input [5], the sum of the first and last elements is 5 + 5 = 10, which is an even number. Therefore, the array is sorted in descending order.

The output of executing the function sort_array on the input [5] is [5].
