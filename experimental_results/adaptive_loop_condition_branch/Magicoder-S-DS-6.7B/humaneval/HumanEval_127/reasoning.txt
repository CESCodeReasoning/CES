The function `intersection` is called with ( interval1 = (1, 2), interval2 = (2, 3) ).
The function `is_prime` is called with ( num = 1 ).
The function `is_prime` returns `False` because 1 is not a prime number.
The function `intersection` returns `NO` because the length of the intersection is 0, which is not a prime number.
Therefore, the final output of the function `intersection((1, 2), (2, 3))` is `NO`.
