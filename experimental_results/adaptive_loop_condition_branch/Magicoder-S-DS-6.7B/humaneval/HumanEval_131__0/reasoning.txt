The function `digits` is called with ( n = 120 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1 and `odd_count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The digit '1' is odd, so product becomes 1 and odd_count becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The digit '2' is even, so no action is taken.
Iteration 3:
    -The digit '0' is even, so no action is taken.

Since odd_count is not 0, the function returns the product, which is 1.
