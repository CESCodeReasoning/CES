The function `fibfib` is called with ( n = 10 ).
The first condition `n == 0` is not satisfied, so the branch is not taken.
The second condition `n == 1` is not satisfied, so the branch is not taken.
The third condition `n == 2` is not satisfied, so the branch is not taken.
The function then calls itself recursively with `n - 1`, `n - 2`, and `n - 3`.

The recursive calls are:
- `fibfib(n - 1)`: This is the same as `fibfib(9)`.
- `fibfib(n - 2)`: This is the same as `fibfib(8)`.

- `fibfib(n - 1)`: This is the same as `fibfib(6)`.
