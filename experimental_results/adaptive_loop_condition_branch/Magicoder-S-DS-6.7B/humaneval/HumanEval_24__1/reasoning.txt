The function `largest_divisor` is called with ( n = 100 ).
The function iterates from 99 down to 1 (since `reversed(range(n))` generates a reversed range from 1 to n-1).
First Iteration (i = 99)
   - `n` is divisible by `i` (99), so the function returns `i` (99).
Second Iteration (i = 98)
   - `n` is not divisible by `i` (98), so the function continues to the next iteration.
Third Iteration (i = 97)
   - `n` is not divisible by `i` (97), so the function continues to the next iteration.
Fourth Iteration (i = 96)
   - `n` is not divisible by `i` (96), so the function continues to the next iteration.

Eighty-ninth Iteration (i = 2)
   - `n` is not divisible by `i` (2), so the function continues to the next iteration.
Ninety-th Iteration (i = 1)
   - `n` is not divisible by `i` (1), so the function continues to the next iteration.

Therefore, the final output of the function `largest_divisor(100)` is 99.
