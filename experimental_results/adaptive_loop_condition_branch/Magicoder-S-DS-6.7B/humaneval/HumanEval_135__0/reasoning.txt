The function `can_arrange` is called with ( arr = [1,2,4,5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The loop iterates from 1 through 4 (since ( len(arr) = 4 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    - arr[i] < arr[i - 1] when i=1
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true. The branch is taken.
    - `ind = i` updates `ind` to 1 ( -1 + 1 = 0 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - arr[i] < arr[i - 1] when i=2
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - arr[i] < arr[i - 1] when i=3
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true. The branch is taken.
    - `ind = i` updates `ind` to 3 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    - arr[i] < arr[i - 1] when i=4
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The branch is not taken.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is now 1.
