The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the elements that appear once in the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5], we need to count the occurrences of each number in the list and then filter out the numbers that appear more than once.

The input list [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5] has the following counts:
- 1 appears once
- 2 appears twice
- 3 appears twice
- 4 appears once
- 5 appears once

Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5] is [1, 4, 5].
