The function `by_length` is called with (arr = [1, -1, 3, 2]).
The function sorts the array in descending order.
The sorted array is [-1, 1, 2, 3].
The loop iterates over the sorted array.

First Iteration (var = -1):
    The try block tries to append the value of dic[-1] to new_arr.
    Since -1 is not a key in the dictionary, it raises a KeyError.
    The except block is executed, and the program continues to the next iteration.

Second Iteration (var = 1):
    The try block tries to append the value of dic[1] to new_arr.
    dic[1] = 'One', so 'One' is appended to new_arr.

Third Iteration (var = 2):
    The try block tries to append the value of dic[2] to new_arr.
    dic[2] = 'Two', so 'Two' is appended to new_arr.

Fourth Iteration (var = 3):
    The try block tries to append the value of dic[3] to new_arr.
    dic[3] = 'Three', so 'Three' is appended to new_arr.

The function returns the new_arr, which is ['Three', 'Two', 'One'].
