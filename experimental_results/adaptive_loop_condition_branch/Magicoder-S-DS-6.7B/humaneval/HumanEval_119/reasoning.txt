The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['()(', ')'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `S1` and `S2` are initialized to the concatenation of the first and second elements of the input list.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 0.

Since val is 0 at the end of the first string, the function returns 'Yes'.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 0.

Since val is 0 at the end of the second string, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `match_parens(['()(', ')'])` is 'Yes'.
