The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input. It squares each number in the list if the number is positive, odd, and does not contain a decimal point. The sum of these squared numbers is then returned.

To determine the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [0.2, 3, 5], we need to square each number in the list if it is positive, odd, and does not contain a decimal point.

The number 0.2 is not positive, so it is not included in the sum.
The number 3 is positive, odd, and does not contain a decimal point, so it is squared (9) and added to the sum.
The number 5 is positive, odd, and does not contain a decimal point, so it is squared (25) and added to the sum.

Therefore, the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [0.2, 3, 5] is 34.
