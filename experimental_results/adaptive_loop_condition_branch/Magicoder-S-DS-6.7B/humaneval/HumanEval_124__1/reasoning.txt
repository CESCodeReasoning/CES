The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '04-2003' ).
The date is stripped to remove any leading or trailing spaces.
The date is then split into month, day, and year.
The month, day, and year are converted to integers.
If the month is less than 1 or greater than 12, the function returns False.
If the month is in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and the day is less than 1 or greater than 31, the function returns False.
If the month is in [4, 6, 9, 11] and the day is less than 1 or greater than 30, the function returns False.
If the month is 2 and the day is less than 1 or greater than 29, the function returns False.
If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('04-2003')` is False.
