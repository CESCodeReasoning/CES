The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and checks if n is even (i.e., n % 2 == 0) and if n is greater than or equal to 8. If both conditions are true, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 6, we need to check if 6 is even and greater than or equal to 8.

6 is even (because 6 / 2 = 3, leaving no remainder), and 6 is also greater than or equal to 8 (because 8 is the smallest even number greater than or equal to 8).

Therefore, the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 6 is True.
