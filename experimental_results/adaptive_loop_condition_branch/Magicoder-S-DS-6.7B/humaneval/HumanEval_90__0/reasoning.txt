The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input and returns the second smallest number in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [5, 1, 4, 3, 2], we need to sort the list in ascending order and then return the second element.

First, we sort the list [5, 1, 4, 3, 2] to get [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Then, we return the second element which is 2.

Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [5, 1, 4, 3, 2] is 2.
