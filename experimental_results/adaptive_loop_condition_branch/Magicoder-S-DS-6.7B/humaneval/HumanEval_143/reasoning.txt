The function words_in_sentence(sentence) takes a sentence as its parameter.
The function splits the sentence into words and then checks each word.
If the length of the word is 1 or 2, it is added to the new list.
If the length of the word is not 1 or 2, it checks if it can be divided by any number other than 1 and itself. If it can, it is not added to the new list.
If the word can't be divided by any number other than 1 and itself, it is added to the new list.
