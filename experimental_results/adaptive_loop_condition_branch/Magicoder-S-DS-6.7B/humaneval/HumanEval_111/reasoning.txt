The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'a b b a' ).
Inside the function, a variable `dict1` is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The input string is split into a list of words.

Iteration 1:
    -The word 'a' appears 2 times in the list, which is more than the current maximum count (0).
    -The maximum count is updated to 2.
Iteration 2:
    -The word 'b' appears 2 times in the list, which is equal to the current maximum count (2).
    -The word 'b' is added to the dictionary with a count of 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The word 'a' appears 2 times in the list, which is equal to the current maximum count (2).
    -The word 'a' is added to the dictionary with a count of 2.

The function returns the dictionary `dict1`, which contains the words 'a' and 'b' with a count of 2.
