The function `count_upper` is called with ( s = 'dBBE' ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'd' is not in "AEIOU", so no increment in count.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'B' is not in "AEIOU", so no increment in count.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'B' is not in "AEIOU", so no increment in count.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'E' is in "AEIOU", so count becomes 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `count_upper('dBBE')` is 1.
