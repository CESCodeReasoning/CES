The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 144, b = 60 ).
Inside the function, a while loop is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
First Iteration:
    - a = 144, b = 60.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 60 and b to 144 % 60 = 12.
Second Iteration:
    - a = 60, b = 12.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 12 and b to 60 % 12 = 0.
b becomes 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 12.
