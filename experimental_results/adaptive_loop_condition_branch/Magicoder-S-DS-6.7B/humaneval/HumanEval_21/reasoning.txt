The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of floating point numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is rescaled to the range [0, 1] by subtracting the minimum number and dividing by the range.

To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9], we need to subtract the minimum number (2.0) from each number in the list and then divide by the range (49.9 - 2.0 = 47.9).

For example, for the number 2.0, the rescaled number is (2.0 - 2.0) / 47.9 = 0.0 / 47.9 = 0.0.
For the number 49.9, the rescaled number is (49.9 - 2.0) / 47.9 = 47.9 / 47.9 = 1.0.

Therefore, the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9] is [0.0, 1.0].
