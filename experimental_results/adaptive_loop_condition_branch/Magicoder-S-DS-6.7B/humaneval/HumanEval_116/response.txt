@@ Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def sort_array(arr):
    return sorted(sorted(arr), key=lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1'))
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sort_array([1,5,2,3,4]) 
[/INPUT]
@@ Response
[REASONING]
The function sort_array takes a list of integers as input and returns a sorted list.
The sorted function in Python sorts the elements of the list in ascending order.
The lambda function in Python is an anonymous function that can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
The bin function in Python converts an integer number to a binary string prefixed with "0b".
The count method in Python returns the number of times a specified value appears in the string.

The sorted function is applied twice on the input list. The first sorted function sorts the list in ascending order. The second sorted function sorts the list based on the number of '1's in the binary representation of each number.

For example, if the input list is [1,5,2,3,4], the binary representation of each number is:
1: 0b1
5: 0b101
2: 0b10
3: 0b11
4: 0b100

After sorting based on the number of '1's, the list becomes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4] is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
