The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the elements that appear only once in the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 4], we need to count the occurrences of each number in the list and then filter out the numbers that appear more than once.

The input list [1, 2, 3, 4] contains 1, 2, 3, and 4. The number 1 appears once, the number 2 appears once, the number 3 appears once, and the number 4 appears once. Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] is [1, 2, 3, 4].
