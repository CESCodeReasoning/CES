The function `string_xor` is called with ( a = '0101', b = '0000' ).
The inner function `xor` is defined.
The `zip` function is used to iterate over the two strings `a` and `b` simultaneously.
For the first iteration (i = 0, j = 0),
   - `i` and `j` are both '0', which satisfies ( i == j ).
   - The condition `i == j` is true.
   - Action: `xor` returns '0' and this is added to the result string.
For the second iteration (i = 1, j = 0),
   - `i` is '1', `j` is '0', which still satisfies ( i == j ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `xor` returns '0' and this is added to the result string.
For the third iteration (i = 0, j = 0),
   - `i` and `j` are both '0', which still satisfies ( i == j ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `xor` returns '0' and this is added to the result string.
For the fourth iteration (i = 1, j = 0),
   - `i` is '1', `j` is '0', which still satisfies ( i == j ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `xor` returns '0' and this is added to the result string.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of the result string, which is '0000'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `string_xor('0101', '0000')` is '0000'.
