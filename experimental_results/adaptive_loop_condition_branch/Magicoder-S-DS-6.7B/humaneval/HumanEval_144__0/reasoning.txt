The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "2/4", n = "8/4" ).
The function splits the input strings into numerator and denominator parts.
The numerator of the first fraction is 2 and the denominator is 4.
The numerator of the second fraction is 8 and the denominator is 4.
The numerator of the first fraction multiplied by the denominator of the second fraction equals the numerator of the second fraction multiplied by the denominator of the first fraction.
The condition `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("2/4", "8/4")` is True.
