The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["d", "dcba", "abcd", "a"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of 'd' is 1, which is not even.
Iteration 2:
    -The length of 'dcba' is 4, which is even. So, 'dcba' is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The length of 'abcd' is 4, which is even. So, 'abcd' is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 4:
    -The length of 'a' is 1, which is not even.

After the loop, the function returns the sorted list `new_lst`, which is ['dcba', 'abcd'].
