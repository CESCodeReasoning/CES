The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 33, y = 12354 ).
The condition `x > y` is false, so the first if branch is not taken.
The condition `y % 2 == 0` is false, so the second if branch is not taken.
The condition `x == y` is false, so the third if branch is not taken.
The function returns `y - 1`, which is 12354 - 1 = 12353.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(33, 12354)` is 12353.
