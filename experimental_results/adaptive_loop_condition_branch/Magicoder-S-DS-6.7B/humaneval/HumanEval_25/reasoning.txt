The function `factorize` is called with ( n = 2 ).
Inside the function, a variable `fact` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 2 through the square root of n (since ( n = 2 )).
First Iteration (i = 2):
    - n % i == 0 when n=2 and i=2
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`fact.append(i)` appends 2 to `fact`.
    -`n //= i` updates `n` to 1 ( 2 // 2 = 1 ).
The loop completes, since `n > 1` is false.
The function returns the value of `fact`, which is now [2].
