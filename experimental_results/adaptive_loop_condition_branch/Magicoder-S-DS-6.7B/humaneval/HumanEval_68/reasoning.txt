The function `pluck` is called with ( arr = [4,2,3] ).
The condition `len(arr) == 0` is false, so the if branch is not taken.
The function `filter` is used to create a new list with all elements that satisfy the condition `x%2 == 0`. In this case, the condition is that the number is even, so the list `evens` contains only the even numbers in the array.
The condition `evens == []` is false, so the if branch is not taken.
The function `min` is used to find the smallest number in the list `evens`.
The function `index` is used to find the index of the smallest number in the original array.
The function returns a list with the smallest even number and its index in the original array.

Therefore, the final output of the function `pluck([4,2,3])` is [2, 1].
