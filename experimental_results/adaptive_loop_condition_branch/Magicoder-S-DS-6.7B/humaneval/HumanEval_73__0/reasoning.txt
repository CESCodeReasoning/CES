The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1, 4, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of the array (1) is not equal to the last element of the array (2), so ans becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element of the array (4) is not equal to the second last element of the array (4), so ans remains 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The third element of the array (2) is not equal to the first element of the array (2), so ans remains 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1, 4, 2])` is 1.
