The function get_positive takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the positive integers from the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2], we need to filter out the negative numbers from the input list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2] is an empty list [].
