The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = '[[]]' ).
Inside the function, two empty lists `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` are initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '[' is an opening bracket, so it is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character ']' is a closing bracket, so it is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.

After the loop, `closing_bracket_index` is reversed.

Iteration 1:
    -The index of the first opening bracket is less than the index of the first closing bracket, so `cnt` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_nested('[[]]')` is True.
