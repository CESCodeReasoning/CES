The function add takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers at odd indices in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 4, 6, 8], we need to sum all even numbers at odd indices in the list.

The list [4, 4, 6, 8] has the following elements:
- 4 at index 0 (odd)
- 4 at index 1 (even)
- 6 at index 2 (odd)
- 8 at index 3 (even)

Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 4, 6, 8] is 8 (4 + 6).
