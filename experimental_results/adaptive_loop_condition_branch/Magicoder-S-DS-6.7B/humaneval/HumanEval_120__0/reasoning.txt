The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1 ).
`k` is 1, which is not equal to 0.
The condition `k == 0` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
The array is sorted in ascending order, resulting in `arr = [-3, -2, -1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`.
The last `k` elements of the sorted array are taken, which are `[2]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1)` is `[2]`.
