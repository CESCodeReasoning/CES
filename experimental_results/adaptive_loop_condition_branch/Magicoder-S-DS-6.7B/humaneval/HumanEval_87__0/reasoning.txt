The function get_row takes a 2D list lst and a number x as input. It returns a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates of the number x in the 2D list.

To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2, we need to find the coordinates of the number 2 in the 2D list. Since the 2D list does not contain the number 2, the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2 is an empty list.
