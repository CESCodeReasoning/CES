The function `any_int` is called with ( x = 2, y = 3, z = 1 ).
All the inputs are integers, which satisfies (isinstance(x,int) and isinstance(y,int) and isinstance(z,int)), the if branch is taken.
The condition `(x+y==z) or (x+z==y) or (y+z==x)` is False, and the branch is not taken.

Therefore, the final output of the function `any_int(2, 3, 1)` is False.
