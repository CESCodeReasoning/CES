The function select_words(s, n) takes a string and a number as its parameters.
The string is split into words using the split() method.
For each word, the function counts the number of consonants in the word.
If the number of consonants in the word is equal to the given number n, the word is appended to the result list.
First Iteration:
    - word = "Mary"
    - n_consonants = 2
    - n = 3, so the word is not appended to the result list.
Second Iteration:
    - word = "had"
    - n_consonants = 1
    - n = 3, so the word is not appended to the result list.
Third Iteration:
    - word = "a"
    - n_consonants = 0
    - n = 3, so the word is not appended to the result list.
Fourth Iteration:
    - word = "little"
    - n_consonants = 3
    - n = 3, so the word is appended to the result list.
Fifth Iteration:
    - word = "lamb"
    - n_consonants = 2
    - n = 3, so the word is not appended to the result list.
