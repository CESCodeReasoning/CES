The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with ( paren_string = '()()((((()()((()))))()()()))' ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` and `current_string` are initialized to empty lists.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is found, so current_depth is incremented to 1 and '(' is appended to current_string.
Iteration 2:
    -The character ')' is found, so current_depth is decremented to 0 and ')' is appended to current_string.
    -Since current_depth is 0, ')' is appended to current_string and the current_string is appended to result.
