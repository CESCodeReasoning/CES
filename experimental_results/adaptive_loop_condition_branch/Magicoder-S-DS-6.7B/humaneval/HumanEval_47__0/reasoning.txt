The function `median` is called with ( l = [8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7] ).
The list is sorted in ascending order, resulting in [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 9].
The length of the list is 7, which is odd.
The condition `len(l) % 2 == 1` is true, therefore the if branch is taken.
The median is the middle number in the sorted list. Since the list length is odd, the median is the middle number.
The middle number is 8, so the function returns 8.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7])` is 8.
