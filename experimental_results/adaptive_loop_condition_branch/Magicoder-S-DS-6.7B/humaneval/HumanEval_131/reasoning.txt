The function `digits` is called with ( n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1 and `odd_count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The digit '5' is converted to integer 5.
    -5 is not an odd number, so no action is taken.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digits(5)` is 0.
