The function `check_dict_case` is called with ( dict = {"p":"pineapple", "b":"banana"} ).
Inside the function, a variable `state` is initialized to "start".

Iteration 1:
    -The key 'p' is a string and is not uppercase, so state becomes "mixed".
Iteration 2:
    -The key 'b' is a string and is not uppercase, so state becomes "mixed".

The function returns False, because the state is "mixed".
