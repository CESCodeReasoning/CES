The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 97, shift = 8 ).
The length of the string representation of `x` is 2, which is less than `shift` (8).
The condition `shift > len(s)` is true, therefore the else branch is taken.
The function returns the reversed string of `x`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(97, 8)` is '79'.
