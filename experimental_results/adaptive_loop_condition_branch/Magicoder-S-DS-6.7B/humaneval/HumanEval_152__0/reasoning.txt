The function compare takes two lists, game and guess, as input. It returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements in the two lists.

To determine the output of executing the function compare on the inputs [1,2,3,5] and [-1,2,3,4], we need to calculate the absolute differences between corresponding elements in the two lists.

The first element of the game list is 1 and the first element of the guess list is -1. The absolute difference between these two numbers is 1.

The second element of the game list is 2 and the second element of the guess list is 2. The absolute difference between these two numbers is 0.

The third element of the game list is 3 and the third element of the guess list is 3. The absolute difference between these two numbers is 0.

The fourth element of the game list is 5 and the fourth element of the guess list is 4. The absolute difference between these two numbers is 1.

Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the inputs [1,2,3,5] and [-1,2,3,4] is [1,0,0,1].
