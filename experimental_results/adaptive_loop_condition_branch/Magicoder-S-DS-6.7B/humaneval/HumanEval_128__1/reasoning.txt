The function `prod_signs` is called with ( arr = [1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1] ).
The condition `not arr` is false, so the else branch is taken.
The list comprehension `[abs(i) for i in arr]` calculates the absolute values of all elements in the array.
The condition `0 in arr` is false, so the list comprehension calculates the absolute values of all elements in the array.
The condition `x < 0` is checked for each element in the array.
The `filter` function returns a list of elements that satisfy the condition `x < 0`.
The `len` function returns the number of elements in the list returned by `filter`.
The `(-1) ** len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr)))` calculates the product of -1 raised to the power of the number of negative elements in the array.
The `prod` variable is initialized to 0 if 0 is in the array, otherwise it is initialized to the product of -1 raised to the power of the number of negative elements in the array.
The `prod * sum([abs(i) for i in arr])` calculates the product of the sum of the absolute values of all elements in the array and the product of -1 raised to the power of the number of negative elements in the array.
The function returns the product of the sum of the absolute values of all elements in the array and the product of -1 raised to the power of the number of negative elements in the array.

Therefore, the final output of the function `prod_signs([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1])` is 12.
