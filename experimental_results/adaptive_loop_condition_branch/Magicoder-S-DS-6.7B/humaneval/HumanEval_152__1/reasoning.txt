The function compare takes two lists, game and guess, as input. It returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements in the two lists.

To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input ([0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]), we need to calculate the absolute differences between corresponding elements in the two lists.

For example, the first element of the game list is 0 and the first element of the guess list is also 0. The absolute difference between these two numbers is 0.

The second element of the game list is 0 and the second element of the guess list is also 0. The absolute difference between these two numbers is 0.

And so on, until we reach the last element of the lists.

Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input ([0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]) is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
