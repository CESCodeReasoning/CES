The function `eat` is called with ( number = 2, need = 11, remaining = 5 ).
The condition `need <= remaining` is false, so the else branch is taken.
The function returns a list with the first element being the sum of `number` and `remaining` (which is 2 + 5 = 7), and the second element being 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `eat(2, 11, 5)` is [7, 0].
