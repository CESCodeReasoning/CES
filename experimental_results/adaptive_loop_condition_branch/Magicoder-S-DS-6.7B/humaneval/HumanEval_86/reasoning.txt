The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input and returns a new string.
The function splits the input string into words and sorts each word alphabetically.
The sorted words are then joined back together with a space in between each word.

For example, if the input string is 'Hi', the function will split it into ['Hi'] and sort each word alphabetically.
The sorted words are then joined back together with a space in between each word, resulting in 'iH'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input 'Hi' is 'iH'.
