The function sort_array takes an array as input and returns an empty array if the length of the array is 0. Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order. If the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, it sorts the array in descending order.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [15, 42, 87, 32 ,11, 0], we need to sort the array in ascending order. Since the sum of the first and last elements (15+0) is even, we sort the array in descending order.

The sorted array in descending order is [87, 42, 32, 15, 11, 0].
