The function string_to_md5 takes a string text as input and returns the MD5 hash of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function string_to_md5 on the input 'Hello world', we need to convert the string to its MD5 hash.

The Python hashlib library provides the md5 function which can be used to generate the MD5 hash of a string. The encode function is used to convert the string to bytes before hashing.

The input 'Hello world' is converted to bytes using the 'ascii' encoding and then passed to the md5 function. The hexdigest function is then used to convert the hash from bytes to a string of hexadecimal digits.

The MD5 hash of 'Hello world' is 'ed076287532e86365e841e92bfc50d8c'.
