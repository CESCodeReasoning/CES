The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 100, shift = 2 ).
The string representation of `x` is "100".
The length of this string is 3.
`shift` is 2, which is greater than 3.
The condition `shift > len(s)` is true, therefore the else branch is taken.
The string is reversed and returned.

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(100, 2)` is "001".
