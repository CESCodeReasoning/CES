The function `solve` is called with ( s = "ab" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'a' is an alphabet, so it is swapped case and flg becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'b' is an alphabet, so it is swapped case and flg becomes 1.

After the loop, if flg is 0, it means no alphabet was found in the string, so the string is reversed and returned.
