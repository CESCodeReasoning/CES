The function `below_threshold` is called with ( l = [1, 8, 4, 10], t = 11 ).
The function iterates over the list `l`.

Iteration 1:
    -The element 1 is not greater than or equal to 11, so the function continues to the next element.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 8 is greater than 11, so the function returns False.
Iteration 3:
    -The element 4 is not greater than or equal to 11, so the function continues to the next element.
Iteration 4:
    -The element 10 is not greater than or equal to 11, so the function continues to the next element.

Since the function did not return False in any of the iterations, it means that all elements in the list are less than the threshold. Therefore, the function returns True.
