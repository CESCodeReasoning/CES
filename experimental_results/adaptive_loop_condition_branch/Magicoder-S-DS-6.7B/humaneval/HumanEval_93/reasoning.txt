The function encode takes a string message as input and returns the encoded message.

The first step is to create a dictionary vowels_replace that maps each vowel to its next character in the ASCII table.

The second step is to swap the case of the message. This means that all lowercase letters become uppercase and vice versa.

The third step is to encode the message. For each character in the message, if it is a vowel, it is replaced by its next character in the ASCII table. If it is not a vowel, it remains the same.

For the input 'TEST', the output of the function encode('TEST') is 'UGVU'.

The vowels in 'TEST' are 'E' and 'E', and their next characters in the ASCII table are 'G' and 'G' respectively. Therefore, the encoded message is 'UGVU'.
