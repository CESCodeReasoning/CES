The function `encrypt` is called with ( s = 'asdfghjkl' ).
Inside the function, a variable `out` is initialized to an empty string.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'a' is in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', so it is shifted 2 places to the right (which is 'c').
Iteration 2:
    -The character 's' is in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', so it is shifted 2 places to the right (which is 'u').
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'd' is in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', so it is shifted 2 places to the right (which is 'f').
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'f' is in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', so it is shifted 2 places to the right (which is 'h').
Iteration 5:
    -The character 'g' is in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', so it is shifted 2 places to the right (which is 'j').
Iteration 6:
    -The character 'h' is in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', so it is shifted 2 places to the right (which is 'l').
Iteration 7:
    -The character 'j' is in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', so it is shifted 2 places to the right (which is 'n').
Iteration 8:
    -The character 'k' is in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', so it is shifted 2 places to the right (which is 'p').
Iteration 9:
    -The character 'l' is in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', so it is shifted 2 places to the right (which is 'r').
