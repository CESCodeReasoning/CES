The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
If the current number is even, the inner loop calculates the factorial of the number and appends it to the result list.
If the current number is odd, the inner loop calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to the current number and appends it to the result list.
First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, the condition `i % 2 == 0` is False, the else branch is taken.
    - `x` is 0, the inner loop iterates from 1 to 1 (inclusive), `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
    - After the inner loop, `x` is 0, append 0 to the result list.
Second Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, the condition `i % 2 == 0` is True, the if branch is taken.
    - `x` is 1, the inner loop iterates from 1 to 2 (inclusive), `x` is multiplied by the current number in each iteration.
    - After the inner loop, `x` is 2, append 2 to the result list.
Third Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, the condition `i % 2 == 0` is False, the else branch is taken.
    - `x` is 0, the inner loop iterates from 1 to 3 (inclusive), `x` is incremented by the current number in each iteration.
    - After the inner loop, `x` is 6, append 6 to the result list.
