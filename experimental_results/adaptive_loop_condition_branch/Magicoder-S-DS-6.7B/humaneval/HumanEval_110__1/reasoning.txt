The function `exchange` is called with ( lst1 = [100, 200], lst2 = [200, 200] ).
Inside the function, two variables `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 100 is not odd, so no increment in odd.
    -The number 200 is even, so even becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 200 is even, so even becomes 2.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 200 is even, so even becomes 3.
    -The number 200 is even, so even becomes 4.

The condition `even >= odd` is checked. Since `even` is 4 and `odd` is 0, the condition is true, so the function returns "YES".
