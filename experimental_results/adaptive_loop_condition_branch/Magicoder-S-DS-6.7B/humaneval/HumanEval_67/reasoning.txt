The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "5 apples and 6 oranges", n = 19 ).
Inside the function, a list `lis` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The string '5' is a digit, so it is converted to an integer and appended to the list.
Iteration 2:
    -The string 'apples' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 3:
    -The string 'and' is not a digit, so it is ignored.
Iteration 4:
    -The string '6' is a digit, so it is converted to an integer and appended to the list.
Iteration 5:
    -The string 'oranges' is not a digit, so it is ignored.

The function returns the difference between `n` and the sum of the elements in the list.
