The function `below_threshold` is called with ( l = [1, 20, 4, 10], t = 21 ).
The function iterates over each element in the list.

Iteration 1:
    -The element 1 is not greater than or equal to 21, so the function continues to the next element.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 20 is greater than or equal to 21, so the function returns False.
Iteration 3:
    -The element 4 is not greater than or equal to 21, so the function continues to the next element.
Iteration 4:
    -The element 10 is not greater than or equal to 21, so the function continues to the next element.

Since the function did not return False in any of the iterations, it means that all elements in the list are less than 21. Therefore, the function returns True.
