The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [12345, 2033, 111, 151] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_digit_elements` is initialized as an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 12345 is not all odd digits, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 2033 is not all odd digits, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 111 is all odd digits, so it is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 151 is all odd digits, so it is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.

After the loop, the function returns the sorted list of `odd_digit_elements`, which is [111, 151].
