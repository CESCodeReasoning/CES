The function add_elements takes a list of integers arr and an integer k as input. It returns the sum of the first k elements of arr, but only if the length of the string representation of the element is less than or equal to 2.

To determine the output of executing the function add_elements on the input ([1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99], 3), we need to sum the first 3 elements of the list, but only if the length of the string representation of the element is less than or equal to 2.

The first 3 elements of the list are 1, -2, and -3. The string representation of 1 is "1", which has a length of 1, so it is included in the sum. The string representation of -2 is "2", which has a length of 1, so it is included in the sum. The string representation of -3 is "3", which has a length of 1, so it is included in the sum.

Therefore, the output of executing the function add_elements on the input ([1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99], 3) is 1.
