The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of 'school' is 6, which is not even, so it is not appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 2:
    -The length of 'AI' is 2, which is even, so it is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The length of 'asdf' is 4, which is even, so it is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 4:
    -The length of 'b' is 1, which is not even, so it is not appended to `new_lst`.

After the loop, `new_lst` is sorted by length and returned.
