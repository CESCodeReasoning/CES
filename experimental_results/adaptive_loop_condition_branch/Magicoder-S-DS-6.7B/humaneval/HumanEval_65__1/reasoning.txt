The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 12, shift = 1 ).
The string representation of `x` is "12".
The length of this string is 2.
The shift is 1, which is greater than the length of the string.
The condition `shift > len(s)` is true, therefore the else branch is taken.
The string is reversed and returned.

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(12, 1)` is "21".
