The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['1234567']).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates over each string in the list `lst`.
First Iteration (arr = '1234567'):
    The sum of the odd digits in '1234567' is calculated.
    The string 'the number of odd elements ' + str(n) + 'n the str'+ str(n) +'ng '+ str(n) +' of the '+ str(n) +'nput.' is appended to `res`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `res`, which is now ['the number of odd elements 4n the str4n string 4 of the 4nput.'].
