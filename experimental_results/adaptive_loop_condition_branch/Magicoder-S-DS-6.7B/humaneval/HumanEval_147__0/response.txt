[REASONING]
The function find_all_duplicate(numbers) takes a list of numbers([3, 5, 4, 3, 7, 4]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterats through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=3: compare with 5, 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 1 (numbers[j]=5), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 3 to duplicates.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken. 
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=5: compare with 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=4: compare with 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 4 to duplicates
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=3, Compare with 7, 4:
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - numbers[i] = 7, compare with 4:
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.

@@ Response
[REASONING]
The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The function generates a list A of n elements where each element is the square of the index minus the index plus one.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list A to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
In the innermost loop, for each pair of elements indexed by j and k in the inner loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - `j` is 1, k in the innermost loop is 2, 3, 4, 5.
    - `k` is 2, compare with 3, 4, 5:
        - When k = 2 (A[k]=1), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 3 (A[k]=5), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 4 (A[k]=13), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 5 (A[k]=25), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - `j` is 2, k in the innermost loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - `k` is 3, compare with 4, 5:
        - When k = 3 (A[k]=5), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 4 (A[k]=13), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 5 (A[k]=25), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.

        - When k = 5 (A[k]=25), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is True, the if branch is taken. Append (1, 5, 25) to ans.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
