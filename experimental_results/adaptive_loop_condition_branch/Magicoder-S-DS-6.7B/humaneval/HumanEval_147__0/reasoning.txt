The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The function generates a list A of n elements where each element is the square of the index minus the index plus one.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list A to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
In the innermost loop, for each pair of elements indexed by j and k in the inner loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - `j` is 1, k in the innermost loop is 2, 3, 4, 5.
    - `k` is 2, compare with 3, 4, 5:
        - When k = 2 (A[k]=1), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 3 (A[k]=5), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 4 (A[k]=13), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 5 (A[k]=25), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - `j` is 2, k in the innermost loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - `k` is 3, compare with 4, 5:
        - When k = 3 (A[k]=5), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 4 (A[k]=13), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 5 (A[k]=25), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
    - `j` is 3, k in the innermost loop is 4, 5.
    - `k` is 4, compare with 5:
        - When k = 4 (A[k]=13), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 5 (A[k]=25), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
    - `j` is 4, k in the innermost loop is 5.
    - `k` is 5, compare with 5:
        - When k = 5 (A[k]=25), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is True, the if branch is taken. Append (1, 5, 25) to ans.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - `j` is 5, k in the innermost loop is 5.
    - `k` is 5, compare with 5:
        - When k = 5 (A[k]=25), the condition `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0` is True, the if branch is taken. Append (5, 13, 25) to ans.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.
