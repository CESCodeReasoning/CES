The function sort_array takes an array as input and returns a sorted version of the array.

If the array is empty, the function returns an empty array.

Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order.

If the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, the array is sorted in descending order.

If the sum of the first and last elements of the array is odd, the array is sorted in ascending order.

For example, if the input array is [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of the first and last elements is 2+6 = 8, which is even. Therefore, the array is sorted in descending order.

The sorted array is [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], so the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6] is [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0].
