<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.
@@ Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def sort_array(array):
    return [] if len(array) == 0 else sorted(
        array, reverse=(array[0] + array[-1]) % 2 == 0)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6])
[/INPUT]
@@ Response
[REASONING]
The function sort_array takes an array as input and returns a sorted version of the array.

If the array is empty, the function returns an empty array.

Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order.

If the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, the array is sorted in descending order.

If the sum of the first and last elements of the array is odd, the array is sorted in ascending order.

For example, if the input array is [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of the first and last elements is 2+6 = 8, which is even. Therefore, the array is sorted in descending order.

The sorted array is [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], so the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6] is [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0].
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
[/OUTPUT]<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
