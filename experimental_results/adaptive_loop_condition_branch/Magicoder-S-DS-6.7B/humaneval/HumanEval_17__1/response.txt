<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.
@@ Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    note_map = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}
    return [note_map[x] for x in music_string.split(' ') if x]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
parse_music('.| .| .| .|')
[/INPUT]
@@ Response
[REASONING]
The function parse_music takes a string music_string as input and returns a list of integers. The string is split into a list of strings using the split function, and then each string is mapped to an integer using the note_map dictionary.

The note_map dictionary maps the strings '.|', 'o|', and 'o' to the integers 1, 2, and 4 respectively.

To determine the output of executing the function parse_music on the input '.| .| .| .|', we need to map each string in the input string to its corresponding integer.

Therefore, the output of executing the function parse_music on the input '.| .| .| .|' is [1, 1, 1, 1].
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[/OUTPUT]<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
