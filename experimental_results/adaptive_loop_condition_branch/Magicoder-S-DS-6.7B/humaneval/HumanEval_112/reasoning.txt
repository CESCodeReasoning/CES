The function reverse_delete takes a string s and a string c as input. It first removes all characters in c from s. Then it checks if the resulting string is the same when reversed.

For the input "abcde" and "ae", the function first removes the characters "a" and "e" from "abcde" to get "bcd". Then it checks if "bcd" is the same when reversed, which is "dcb". Since "dcb" is not the same as "bcd", the function returns ("bcd", False).
