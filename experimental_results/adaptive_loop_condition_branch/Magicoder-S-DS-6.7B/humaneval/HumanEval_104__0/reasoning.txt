The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [135, 103, 31] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_digit_elements` is initialized as an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 135 is checked. All digits in 135 are odd, so 135 is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 103 is checked. Only the digit 3 is odd, so 103 is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 31 is checked. Only the digit 1 is odd, so 31 is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.

After the loop, the function returns the sorted list of odd digit numbers, which is [135, 31].
