The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( string = 'xyx' ).
The condition ( not string ) is not satisfied, so the else branch is taken.
The loop iterates from 0 through the length of the string (since ( string = 'xyx' )).
First Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 0):
    - not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) when beginning_of_suffix=0
    - The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( string = 'xyx' ).
    - The condition ( not string ) is not satisfied, so the else branch is taken.
    - The loop iterates from 1 through the length of the string (since ( string = 'xyx' )).
Second Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 1):
    - not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]) when beginning_of_suffix=1
    - The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( string = 'yx' ).
    - The condition ( not string ) is satisfied, so the if branch is taken and the function returns `True` as the output.
