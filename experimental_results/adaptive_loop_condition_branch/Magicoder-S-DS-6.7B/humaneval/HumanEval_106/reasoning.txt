The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates from 1 to n.
For each iteration, if the current number is even, it calculates the factorial of the number and appends it to the list ret.
If the current number is odd, it calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to the current number and appends it to the list ret.
First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, the condition `i%2 == 0` is False, the else branch is taken.
    - x = 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:
        - When j = 1, x = 0 + 1 = 1
        - When j = 2, x = 1 + 2 = 3
        - When j = 3, x = 3 + 3 = 6
        - When j = 4, x = 6 + 4 = 10
        - When j = 5, x = 10 + 5 = 15
    - Append 15 to ret.
Second Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, the condition `i%2 == 0` is True, the if branch is taken.
    - x = 1, j in the inner loop is 1, 2:
        - When j = 1, x = 1 * 1 = 1
        - When j = 2, x = 1 * 2 = 2
    - Append 2 to ret.
Third Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, the condition `i%2 == 0` is False, the else branch is taken.
    - x = 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3:
        - When j = 1, x = 0 + 1 = 1
        - When j = 2, x = 1 + 2 = 3
        - When j = 3, x = 3 + 3 = 6
    - Append 6 to ret.
Forth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, the condition `i%2 == 0` is True, the if branch is taken.
    - x = 1, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4:
        - When j = 1, x = 1 * 1 = 1
        - When j = 2, x = 1 * 2 = 2
        - When j = 3, x = 2 * 3 = 6
        - When j = 4, x = 6 * 4 = 24
    - Append 24 to ret.
Fifth Iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, the condition `i%2 == 0` is False, the else branch is taken.
    - x = 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:
        - When j = 1, x = 0 + 1 = 1
        - When j = 2, x = 1 + 2 = 3
        - When j = 3, x = 3 + 3 = 6
        - When j = 4, x = 6 + 4 = 10
        - When j = 5, x = 10 + 5 = 15
    - Append 15 to ret.
