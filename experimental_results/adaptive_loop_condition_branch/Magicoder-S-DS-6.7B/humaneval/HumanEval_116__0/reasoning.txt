The function sort_array takes a list of integers as input and returns a sorted list.

The sorted function in Python sorts the elements of the list in ascending order.

The lambda function in Python is an anonymous function that can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression. In this case, it is used to count the number of '1's in the binary representation of each number in the list.

The sorted function is called again on the result of the first sorted function. This is done to sort the list based on the number of '1's in the binary representation of each number.

For example, if the input list is [3,6,44,12,32,5], the binary representation of each number is:
- 3: 11
- 6: 110
- 44: 101100
- 12: 1100
- 32: 100000
- 5: 101

The number of '1's in each binary representation is:
- 3: 2
- 6: 2
- 44: 4
- 12: 2
- 32: 5
- 5: 2

So, the sorted list based on the number of '1's in the binary representation of each number is: [3, 5, 6, 12, 32, 44].

The output of executing the function sort_array on the input [3,6,44,12,32,5] is [3, 5, 6, 12, 32, 44].
