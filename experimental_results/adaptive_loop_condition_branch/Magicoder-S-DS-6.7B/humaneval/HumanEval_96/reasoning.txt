The function count_up_to(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates from 2 to n (exclusive) to check each number if it is a prime number.
In the inner loop, for each number i in the outer loop, check if it is divisible by any number from 2 to i-1.
First Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 2.
    - 2 is not divisible by any number from 2 to 1, so it is a prime number. Append 2 to primes.
Second Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 2 and 3.
    - 3 is not divisible by any number from 2 to 2, so it is a prime number. Append 3 to primes.
Third Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 2 and 3.
    - 4 is divisible by 2, so it is not a prime number.
Fourth Iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, j in the inner loop is 2, 3 and 4.
    - 5 is not divisible by any number from 2 to 3, so it is a prime number. Append 5 to primes.
