The function solve takes an integer N as input and returns the binary representation of the sum of the digits of N.
To determine the output of executing the function solve on the input 1000, we need to sum the digits of 1000 (1+0+0+0 = 1) and convert the result to binary.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solve on the input 1000 is "1".
