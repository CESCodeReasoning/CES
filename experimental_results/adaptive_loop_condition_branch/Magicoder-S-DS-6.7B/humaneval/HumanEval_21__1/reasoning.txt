The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is rescaled to the range [0, 1] based on its original range.

To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0], we need to find the minimum and maximum numbers in the list, and then rescale each number in the list to the range [0, 1] based on its original range.

The minimum number in the list is 1.0, and the maximum number is 5.0. Therefore, the rescaled numbers are calculated as follows:

- (2.0 - 1.0) / (5.0 - 1.0) = 1.0
- (1.0 - 1.0) / (5.0 - 1.0) = 0.0
- (5.0 - 1.0) / (5.0 - 1.0) = 1.0
- (3.0 - 1.0) / (5.0 - 1.0) = 0.6
- (4.0 - 1.0) / (5.0 - 1.0) = 0.8

The rescaled list is [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.6, 0.8].
