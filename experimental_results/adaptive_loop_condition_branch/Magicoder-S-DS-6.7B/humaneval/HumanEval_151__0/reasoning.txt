The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the numbers that are greater than 0, odd, and do not contain a decimal point.

To determine the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [-10, -20, -30], we need to find the squares of the numbers that satisfy these conditions.

The first number in the list is -10, which is not greater than 0, so it is not included in the sum.

The second number is -20, which is not greater than 0, so it is not included in the sum.

The third number is -30, which is not greater than 0, so it is not included in the sum.

Therefore, the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [-10, -20, -30] is 0.
