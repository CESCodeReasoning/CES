The function `move_one_ball` is called with ( arr = [3, 5, 4, 1, 2] ).
First, it checks if the length of the array is 0.
   - The length of the array is not 0, so it proceeds to the next step.
Second, it sorts the array in ascending order.
   - The sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Third, it finds the minimum value in the array and its index.
   - The minimum value is 1 and its index is 3.
Fourth, it rearranges the array so that the minimum value is at the beginning.
   - The rearranged array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Fifth, it iterates over the array.
   - For the first iteration (i = 0), the condition `my_arr[i] != sorted_array[i]` is false.
   - For the second iteration (i = 1), the condition is false.
   - For the third iteration (i = 2), the condition is false.
   - For the fourth iteration (i = 3), the condition is false.
   - For the fifth iteration (i = 4), the condition is false.
Therefore, the function returns True.
