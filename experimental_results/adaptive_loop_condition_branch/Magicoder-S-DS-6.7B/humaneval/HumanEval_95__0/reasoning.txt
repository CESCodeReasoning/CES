The function `check_dict_case` is called with ( dict = {"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345" } ).
Inside the function, a variable `state` is initialized to "start".

Iteration 1:
    -The key 'STATE' is a string and is uppercase, so `state` becomes "upper".
Iteration 2:
    -The key 'ZIP' is a string and is not uppercase, so `state` becomes "mixed".

The function returns False because the dictionary keys are not all uppercase or lowercase.
