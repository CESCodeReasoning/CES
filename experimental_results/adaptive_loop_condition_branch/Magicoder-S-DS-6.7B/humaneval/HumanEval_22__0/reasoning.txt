The function filter_integers takes a list of values as input and returns a new list that contains only the integers from the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [], we need to filter out all non-integer values from the input list. Since the input list is empty, there are no non-integer values to filter out, so the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [] is an empty list.
