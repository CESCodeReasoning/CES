The function `minPath` is called with ( grid = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], k = 3 ).
Inside the function, a variable `val` is initialized to `n * n + 1`.

Iteration 1:
    -The cell (0, 0) is 1, so the minimum value in its adjacent cells is 2.
Iteration 2:
    -The cell (0, 1) is 2, so the minimum value in its adjacent cells is 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The cell (0, 2) is 3, so the minimum value in its adjacent cells is 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The cell (1, 0) is 4, so the minimum value in its adjacent cells is 1.
Iteration 5:
    -The cell (1, 1) is 5, so the minimum value in its adjacent cells is 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The cell (1, 2) is 6, so the minimum value in its adjacent cells is 2.
Iteration 7:
    -The cell (2, 0) is 7, so the minimum value in its adjacent cells is 1.
Iteration 8:
    -The cell (2, 1) is 8, so the minimum value in its adjacent cells is 2.
Iteration 9:
    -The cell (2, 2) is 9, so the minimum value in its adjacent cells is 2.

The minimum value in the grid is 1.

The list `ans` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The index is 0, so the value is 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The index is 1, so the value is 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The index is 2, so the value is 1.

The final output of the function `minPath([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 3)` is [1, 1, 1].
