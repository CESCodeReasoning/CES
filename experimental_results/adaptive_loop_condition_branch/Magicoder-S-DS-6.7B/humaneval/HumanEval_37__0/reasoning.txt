The function `sort_even` is called with ( l = [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] ).
First, it separates the even and odd indices into two lists (evens and odds).
Then, it sorts the evens list.
Finally, it iterates over the evens and odds lists simultaneously, appending each even and odd element to the answer list.
If the length of the evens list is greater than the length of the odds list, it appends the last element of the evens list to the answer list.
