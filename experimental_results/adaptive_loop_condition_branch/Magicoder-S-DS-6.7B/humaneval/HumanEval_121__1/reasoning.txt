The function solution takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all odd numbers at even indices.

The list [30, 13, 23, 32] has the following elements at their respective indices:

- 30 at index 0
- 13 at index 1
- 23 at index 2
- 32 at index 3

The odd numbers at even indices are 13 and 32. Their sum is 45.

Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32] is 45.
