The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'a b c d g' ).
Inside the function, a variable `dict1` is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The input string is split into a list of words.

Iteration 1:
    -The word 'a' is not in the dictionary, so it is added with a count of 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The word 'b' is not in the dictionary, so it is added with a count of 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The word 'c' is not in the dictionary, so it is added with a count of 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The word 'd' is not in the dictionary, so it is added with a count of 1.
Iteration 5:
    -The word 'g' is not in the dictionary, so it is added with a count of 1.

The maximum count is 1, so no words are added to the dictionary.

Therefore, the final output of the function `histogram('a b c d g')` is an empty dictionary.
