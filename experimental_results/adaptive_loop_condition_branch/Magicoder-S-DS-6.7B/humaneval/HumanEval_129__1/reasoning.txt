The function `minPath` is called with ( grid = [[8, 14, 9, 2], [6, 4, 13, 15], [5, 7, 1, 12], [3, 10, 11, 16]], k = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `val` is initialized to `n * n + 1`.

Iteration 1:
    -The cell (0, 0) is not 1, so no action is taken.
Iteration 2:
    -The cell (0, 1) is not 1, so no action is taken.
Iteration 3:
    -The cell (0, 2) is not 1, so no action is taken.
Iteration 4:
    -The cell (0, 3) is not 1, so no action is taken.
Iteration 5:
    -The cell (1, 0) is not 1, so no action is taken.
Iteration 6:
    -The cell (1, 1) is 1, so the minimum value of its neighbours is found and assigned to `val`.
Iteration 7:
    -The cell (1, 2) is not 1, so no action is taken.
Iteration 8:
    -The cell (1, 3) is not 1, so no action is taken.
Iteration 9:
    -The cell (2, 0) is not 1, so no action is taken.
Iteration 10:
    -The cell (2, 1) is not 1, so no action is taken.
Iteration 11:
    -The cell (2, 2) is 1, so the minimum value of its neighbours is found and assigned to `val`.
Iteration 12:
    -The cell (2, 3) is not 1, so no action is taken.
Iteration 13:
    -The cell (3, 0) is not 1, so no action is taken.
Iteration 14:
    -The cell (3, 1) is not 1, so no action is taken.
Iteration 15:
    -The cell (3, 2) is not 1, so no action is taken.
Iteration 16:
    -The cell (3, 3) is not 1, so no action is taken.

The function then creates a list `ans` of size `k`.

Iteration 1:
    -The index `i` is 0, which is even, so 1 is appended to `ans`.
Iteration 2:
    -The index `i` is 1, which is odd, so `val` is appended to `ans`.
Iteration 3:
    -The index `i` is 2, which is even, so 1 is appended to `ans`.
Iteration 4:
    -The index `i` is 3, which is odd, so `val` is appended to `ans`.
Iteration 5:
    -The index `i` is 4, which is even, so 1 is appended to `ans`.

The function then returns `ans`.
