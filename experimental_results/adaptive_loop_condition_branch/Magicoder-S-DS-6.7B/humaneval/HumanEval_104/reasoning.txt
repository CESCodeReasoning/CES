The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [15, 33, 1422, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_digit_elements` is initialized as an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 15 is not all odd digits, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 33 is not all odd digits, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 1422 is not all odd digits, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 1 is all odd digits, so it is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.

After the loop, the function returns the sorted list of odd digit numbers, which is [1].
