The function `Strongest_Extension` is called with ( class_name = 'finNNalLLly', extensions = ['Die', 'NowW', 'Wow', 'WoW'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `strong` is initialized to the first element of the `extensions` list.

Iteration 1:
    -The string 'Die' has 1 uppercase letter and 1 lowercase letter, so the difference is 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The string 'NowW' has 1 uppercase letter and 1 lowercase letter, so the difference is 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The string 'Wow' has 1 uppercase letter and 1 lowercase letter, so the difference is 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The string 'WoW' has 1 uppercase letter and 1 lowercase letter, so the difference is 1.

The string 'Wow' has the highest difference, so it becomes the new `strong`.

The final output of the function `Strongest_Extension('finNNalLLly', ['Die', 'NowW', 'Wow', 'WoW'])` is 'finNNalLLly.Wow'.
