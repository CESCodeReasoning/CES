The function solution takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all odd numbers at even indices.

The list [5, 8, 7, 1] has the following indices and values:

0: 5
1: 8
2: 7
3: 1

The odd numbers at even indices are 5 (at index 0) and 1 (at index 3).

Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [5, 8, 7, 1] is 6 (5 + 1).
