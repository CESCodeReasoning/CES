The function `numerical_letter_grade` is called with ( grades = [1.2] ).
Inside the function, a list `letter_grade` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The gpa is 1.2, which is not equal to 4.0, 3.7, 3.3, 3.0, 2.7, 2.3, 2.0, 1.7, 1.3, 1.0, 0.7, 0.0.
    -So, it falls into the else block and appends "E" to the list.
