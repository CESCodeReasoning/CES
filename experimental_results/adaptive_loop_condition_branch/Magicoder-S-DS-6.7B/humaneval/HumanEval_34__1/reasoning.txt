The function unique takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of unique elements in l.
To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1], we need to remove duplicates from the list and sort the list.

First, we convert the list to a set to remove duplicates. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements.

Second, we convert the set back to a list.

Third, we sort the list in ascending order.

Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1] is [1, 2].
