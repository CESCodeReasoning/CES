The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string. The string is a sequence of numbers from 0 to n, separated by spaces.

To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3, we need to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 3, and then join them into a string with spaces in between.

The sequence of numbers from 0 to 3 is 0, 1, 2, 3.

Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3 is "0 1 2 3".
