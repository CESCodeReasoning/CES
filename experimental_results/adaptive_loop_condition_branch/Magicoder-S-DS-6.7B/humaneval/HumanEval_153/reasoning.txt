The function `Strongest_Extension` is called with ( class_name = 'Watashi', extensions = ['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `strong` is initialized to the first element of the `extensions` list.

Iteration 1:
    -The string 'tEN' has 1 uppercase letter and 2 lowercase letters, so the difference is 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The string 'niNE' has 1 uppercase letter and 3 lowercase letters, so the difference is 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The string 'eIGHt8OKe' has 1 uppercase letter and 7 lowercase letters, so the difference is 6.

The string 'eIGHt8OKe' has the highest difference, so it becomes the new `strong`.

The final output of the function `Strongest_Extension('Watashi', ['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe'])` is 'Watashi.eIGHt8OKe'.
