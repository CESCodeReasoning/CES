The function `prod_signs` is called with ( arr = [-1, 1, 1, 1] ).
The condition `not arr` is false, so the else branch is taken.
The list comprehension `[abs(i) for i in arr]` evaluates to [1, 1, 1, 1].
The sum of this list is 4.
The condition `0 in arr` is false, so the list comprehension `list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr))` evaluates to an empty list.
The length of this list is 0.
The expression `(-1) ** len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr)))` evaluates to 1.
The product of 1 and 4 is 4.
Therefore, the final output of the function `prod_signs([-1, 1, 1, 1])` is 4.
