<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.
@@ Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def is_bored(S):
    import re
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)
    return sum(sentence[0:2] == 'I ' for sentence in sentences)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
is_bored("I love It !")
[/INPUT]
@@ Response
[REASONING]
The function is_bored takes a string S as input and returns the number of sentences in S that start with "I ".
To determine the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "I love It !", we need to count the number of sentences in the string that start with "I ".

The function re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S) splits the string S into sentences using the regular expression r'[.?!]\s*'. This regular expression matches any character that is a period, exclamation point, or question mark followed by zero or more whitespace characters.

The sum(sentence[0:2] == 'I ' for sentence in sentences) counts the number of sentences in the list of sentences that start with "I ".

Therefore, the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "I love It !" is 1.
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
1
