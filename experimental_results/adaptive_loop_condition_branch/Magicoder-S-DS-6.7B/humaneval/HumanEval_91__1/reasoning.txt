The function is_bored takes a string S as input and returns the number of sentences in S that start with "I ".
To determine the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "I love It !", we need to count the number of sentences in the string that start with "I ".

The function re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S) splits the string S into sentences using the regular expression r'[.?!]\s*'. This regular expression matches any character that is a period, exclamation point, or question mark followed by zero or more whitespace characters.

The sum(sentence[0:2] == 'I ' for sentence in sentences) counts the number of sentences in the list of sentences that start with "I ".

Therefore, the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "I love It !" is 1.
