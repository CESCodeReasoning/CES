The function triples_sum_to_zero(l) takes a list of numbers([1, 2, 3, 7]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
In the innermost loop, for each pair of elements indexed by j and k in the inner loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3.
    - `i` is 0, k in the innermost loop is 1, 2, 3.
    - l[i]=1: compare with 2, 3, 7:
        - When j = 1 (l[j]=2), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=3), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3.
    - `i` is 1, k in the innermost loop is 2, 3.
    - l[i]=2: compare with 3, 7:
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=3), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3.
    - `i` is 2, k in the innermost loop is 3.
    - l[i]=3: compare with 7:
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 3.
    - `i` is 3, k in the innermost loop is 3.
    - l[i]=7: compare with nothing:
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
