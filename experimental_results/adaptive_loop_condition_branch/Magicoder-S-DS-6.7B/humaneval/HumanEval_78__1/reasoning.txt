The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "123456789ABCDEF0" ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '1' is not in primes, so no increment in total.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '2' is in primes, so total becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '3' is not in primes, so no increment in total.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '4' is not in primes, so no increment in total.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '5' is not in primes, so no increment in total.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '6' is not in primes, so no increment in total.
Iteration 7:
    -The character '7' is in primes, so total becomes 2.
Iteration 8:
    -The character '8' is not in primes, so no increment in total.
Iteration 9:
    -The character '9' is not in primes, so no increment in total.
Iteration 10:
    -The character 'A' is not in primes, so no increment in total.
Iteration 11:
    -The character 'B' is in primes, so total becomes 3.
Iteration 12:
    -The character 'C' is not in primes, so no increment in total.
Iteration 13:
    -The character 'D' is in primes, so total becomes 4.
Iteration 14:
    -The character 'E' is not in primes, so no increment in total.
Iteration 15:
    -The character 'F' is in primes, so total becomes 5.
Iteration 16:
    -The character '0' is not in primes, so no increment in total.
