The function encode takes a string message as input and returns the encoded message.

The first step is to create a dictionary vowels_replace that maps each vowel to its next character in the ASCII table.

The second step is to swap the case of the message. This means that all lowercase letters become uppercase and vice versa.

The third step is to iterate over each character in the message. If the character is a vowel, it is replaced by its next character in the ASCII table. If the character is not a vowel, it remains the same.

The output of executing the function encode on the input 'YES' is 'ZG'.
