The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The list A is created by generating the sequence of numbers (i*i - i + 1) for i from 1 to n.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list A to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
In the innermost loop, for each pair of elements indexed by j and k in the inner loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3 and 4.
    - `k` in the innermost loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - A[i]=1, A[j]=2, A[k]=3:
        - When k = 1 (A[k]=2), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 2 (A[k]=3), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 3 (A[k]=4), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 4 (A[k]=5), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 5 (A[k]=6), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.

        - When k = 5 (A[k]=6), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.

    - A[i]=3, A[j]=4, A[k]=5:
        - When k = 3 (A[k]=4), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 4 (A[k]=5), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 5 (A[k]=6), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 6 (A[k]=7), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 7 (A[k]=8), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):

    - `k` in the innermost loop is 4, 5, 6 and 7.
