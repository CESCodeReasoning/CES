The function get_row takes a 2D list lst and a number x as input. It finds all the coordinates of x in the 2D list and returns them sorted in descending order of their row indices and then by their column indices.

To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[], 1], we need to find all the coordinates of 1 in the 2D list. Since the 2D list is empty, there are no 1s, so the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[], 1] is an empty list.
