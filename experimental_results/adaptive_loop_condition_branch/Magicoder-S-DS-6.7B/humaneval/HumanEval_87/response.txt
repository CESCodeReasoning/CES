<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.
@@ Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def get_row(lst, x):
    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst)) for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
    return sorted(sorted(coords, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True), key=lambda x: x[0])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
get_row([], 1) 
[/INPUT]
@@ Response
[REASONING]
The function get_row takes a 2D list lst and a number x as input. It finds all the coordinates of x in the 2D list and returns them sorted in descending order of their row indices and then by their column indices.

To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[], 1], we need to find all the coordinates of 1 in the 2D list. Since the 2D list is empty, there are no 1s, so the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[], 1] is an empty list.
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[]
