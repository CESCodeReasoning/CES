The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest negative number and the smallest positive number in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7], we need to filter out the negative numbers and positive numbers from the list. Then, find the maximum of the negative numbers and the minimum of the positive numbers.

The negative numbers in the list are [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7] and the positive numbers are []. Therefore, the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7] is (None, None).

The function largest_smallest_integers returns None for both the smallest and largest numbers if the list does not contain any negative numbers or positive numbers respectively.
