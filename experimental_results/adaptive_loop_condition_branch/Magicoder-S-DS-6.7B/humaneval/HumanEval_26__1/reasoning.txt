The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the elements that appear only once in the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [], we need to iterate over the input list and count the occurrence of each number. Then, we need to filter out the numbers that appear more than once.

Since the input list is empty, there are no duplicates, so the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [] is an empty list.
