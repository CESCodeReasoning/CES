The function `fibfib` is called with ( n = 2 ).
The first condition `n == 0` is false, the second condition `n == 1` is false, and the third condition `n == 2` is true.
The function returns the value of `1`, which is the third Fibonacci number.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fibfib(2)` is 1.
