The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "yogurt" ).
The condition `len(word) < 3` is false, so the function proceeds to the next step.
The loop iterates from the second last character to the first character of the word.
Iteration 1:
    -The character 'u' is not in vowels, so it moves to the next iteration.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'r' is not in vowels, so it moves to the next iteration.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 't' is not in vowels, so it moves to the next iteration.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'o' is in vowels, so it checks the characters before and after it.
    -The character before 'o' is 'y', which is in vowels.
    -The character after 'o' is 'g', which is in vowels.
    -So, the function returns 'o'.
