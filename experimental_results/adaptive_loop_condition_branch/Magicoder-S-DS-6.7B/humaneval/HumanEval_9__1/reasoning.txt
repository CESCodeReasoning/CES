The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None and `result` is an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is greater than None, so running_max becomes 1.
    -The running_max (1) is appended to the result list.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 2 is greater than 1, so running_max becomes 2.
    -The running_max (2) is appended to the result list.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 3 is greater than 2, so running_max becomes 3.
    -The running_max (3) is appended to the result list.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 4 is greater than 3, so running_max becomes 4.
    -The running_max (4) is appended to the result list.

Therefore, the final output of the function `rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 4])` is [1, 2, 3, 4].
