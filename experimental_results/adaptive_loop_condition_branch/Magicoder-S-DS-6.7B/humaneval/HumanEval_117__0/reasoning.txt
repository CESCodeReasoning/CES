The function select_words(s, n) takes a string and a number as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each word in the string.
In the inner loop, for each word, it counts the number of consonants in the word.
First Iteration (word="Hello"):
    - word is "Hello", i in the inner loop is 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.
    - word[i]="H": is not a vowel, so increment n_consonants.
    - word[i]="e": is not a vowel, so increment n_consonants.
    - word[i]="l": is a vowel, so do not increment n_consonants.
    - word[i]="l": is a vowel, so do not increment n_consonants.
    - word[i]="o": is not a vowel, so increment n_consonants.
    - n_consonants = 5, so the if condition `n_consonants == n` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (word="world"):
    - word is "world", i in the inner loop is 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.
    - word[i]="w": is a vowel, so do not increment n_consonants.
    - word[i]="o": is a vowel, so do not increment n_consonants.
    - word[i]="r": is not a vowel, so increment n_consonants.
    - word[i]="l": is a vowel, so do not increment n_consonants.
    - word[i]="d": is not a vowel, so increment n_consonants.
    - n_consonants = 3, so the if condition `n_consonants == n` is False, the if branch is not taken.
