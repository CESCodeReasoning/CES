The function flip_case takes a string as input and returns the string with its case flipped.
To determine the output of executing the function flip_case on the input 'Hello!', we need to swap the case of each character in the string.

In the string 'Hello!', the case of each character is as follows:
- 'H' is uppercase, so it becomes lowercase.
- 'e' is lowercase, so it becomes uppercase.
- 'l' is lowercase, so it becomes uppercase.
- 'l' is lowercase, so it becomes uppercase.
- 'o' is lowercase, so it becomes uppercase.
- '!' is not a letter, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the output of executing the function flip_case on the input 'Hello!' is 'hELLO!'.
