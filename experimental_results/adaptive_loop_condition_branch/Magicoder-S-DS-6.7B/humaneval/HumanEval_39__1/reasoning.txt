The function `prime_fib` is called with ( n = 4 ).
Inside the function, a list `f` is initialized with the first two Fibonacci numbers [0, 1].
The while loop continues until a prime Fibonacci number is found.
First Iteration:
    - The Fibonacci number is 1, which is not a prime number.
Second Iteration:
    - The Fibonacci number is 1, which is not a prime number.
Third Iteration:
    - The Fibonacci number is 2, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is true.
    - `n -= 1` updates `n` to 3.
Fourth Iteration:
    - The Fibonacci number is 3, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is true.
    - `n -= 1` updates `n` to 2.
Fifth Iteration:
    - The Fibonacci number is 5, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is true.
    - `n -= 1` updates `n` to 1.
Sixth Iteration:
    - The Fibonacci number is 8, which is not a prime number.
Seventh Iteration:
    - The Fibonacci number is 13, which is a prime number.
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is true.
    - `n -= 1` updates `n` to 0.
The loop breaks and the function returns the last Fibonacci number, which is 13.
