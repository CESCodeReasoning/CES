The function `count_nums` is called with ( arr = [1, 6, 9, -6, 0, 1, 5] ).
The function `digits_sum` is defined inside `count_nums`.
The function `digits_sum` is called for each element in the input list.
For each element, if the number is negative, it is converted to positive and a flag `neg` is set to -1.
The number is then converted to a list of digits.
The first digit is multiplied by `neg` to maintain the sign of the original number.
The sum of the digits is calculated and returned.
The function `filter` is used to filter out the positive numbers from the list of sums.
The length of the filtered list is returned, which is the count of numbers in the input list whose digits sum to a positive number.

Therefore, the final output of the function `count_nums([1, 6, 9, -6, 0, 1, 5])` is 4.
