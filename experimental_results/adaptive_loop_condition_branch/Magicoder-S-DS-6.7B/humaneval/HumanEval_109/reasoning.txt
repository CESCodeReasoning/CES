The function `move_one_ball` is called with ( arr = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] ).
The function checks if the length of the array is 0.
If the length of the array is 0, it returns True.
If the length of the array is not 0, it sorts the array and creates a new array.
The function then iterates over the array and checks if the current element in the array is not equal to the current element in the sorted array.
If it finds a pair where the elements are not equal, it returns False.
If it doesn't find any such pair, it returns True.
