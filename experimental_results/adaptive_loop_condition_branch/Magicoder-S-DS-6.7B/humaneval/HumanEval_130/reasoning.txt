The function `tri` is called with ( n = 3 ).
The first condition is checked, which is `n == 0`.
This condition is false, so the function proceeds to the next condition.
The list `my_tri` is initialized with the first two elements [1, 3].
The loop iterates from 2 through 3 (since ( n = 3 )).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which is not divisible by 2.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` results in `my_tri = [1, 3, 2]`.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which is divisible by 2.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` updates `my_tri` to [1, 3, 2, 2].
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `my_tri`, which is now [1, 3, 2, 2].

Therefore, the final output of the function `tri(3)` is [1, 3, 2, 2].
