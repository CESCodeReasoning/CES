The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "full" ).
The condition `len(word) < 3` is false, so the function proceeds to the next step.
The loop iterates from the second last character to the first character of the word.
Iteration 1:
    -The character 'l' is not in vowels, so it skips to the next iteration.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'u' is in vowels, so it checks the next character and the previous character.
    -The next character is 'l', which is in vowels, so it skips to the next iteration.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'f' is not in vowels, so it skips to the next iteration.
The function returns an empty string, as it did not find any vowel that was not followed or preceded by another vowel.
