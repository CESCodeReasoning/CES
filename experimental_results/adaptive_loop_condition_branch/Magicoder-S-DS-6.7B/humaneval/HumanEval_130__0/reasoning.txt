The function `tri` is called with ( n = 20 ).
The first condition is checked, which is `n == 0`.
This condition is not true, so the function proceeds to the next condition.
The list `my_tri` is initialized with the first two elements [1, 3].
The loop iterates from 2 through 20 (since ( n = 20 )).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which is not divisible by 2.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` results in `my_tri = [1, 3, 2]`.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which is not divisible by 2.
   - The same condition is false.
