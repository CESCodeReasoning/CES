The function add takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers at odd indices in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88], we need to sum all even numbers at odd indices in the list.

The list [4, 88] has two elements, and the first element is at index 0 (which is odd), so it is not included in the sum. The second element is at index 1 (which is odd), and it is an even number, so it is included in the sum.

Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88] is 88.
