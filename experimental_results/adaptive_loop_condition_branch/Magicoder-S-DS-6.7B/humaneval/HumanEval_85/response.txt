<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.
@@ Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def add(lst):
    return sum([lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i]%2 == 0])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
add([4, 88]) 
[/INPUT]
@@ Response
[REASONING]
The function add takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers at odd indices in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88], we need to sum all even numbers at odd indices in the list.

The list [4, 88] has two elements, and the first element is at index 0 (which is odd), so it is not included in the sum. The second element is at index 1 (which is odd), and it is an even number, so it is included in the sum.

Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88] is 88.
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
88
[/OUTPUT]<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
