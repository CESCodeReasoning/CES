The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Wow' ).
The length of the string is 3.
The condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is not satisfied (since 3 is not 0 or 1).
The loop iterates from 2 through 2 (since ( l = 3 )).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `l` is 3, which is divisible by 2.
   - The condition `l % i == 0` is true.
   - Action: The function returns False.
Therefore, the final output of the function `prime_length('Wow')` is False.
