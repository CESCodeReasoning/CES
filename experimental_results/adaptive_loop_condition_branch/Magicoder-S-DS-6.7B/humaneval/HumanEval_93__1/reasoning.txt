The function encode takes a string message as input and returns the encoded message.

The first step is to create a dictionary vowels_replace that maps each vowel to its next character in the ASCII table.

The second step is to swap the case of the message. This means that all lowercase letters are converted to uppercase and vice versa.

The third step is to iterate over each character in the message. If the character is a vowel, it is replaced by its next character in the ASCII table. If the character is not a vowel, it is left unchanged.

The final step is to join all the characters together into a single string.

For the input "I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE", the output will be "I DpNu KpNu WpHu Tp WpRuTU".

The vowels are replaced by the next character in the ASCII table, and the case of the letters is swapped.
