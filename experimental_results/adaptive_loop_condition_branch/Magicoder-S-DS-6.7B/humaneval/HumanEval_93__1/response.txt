<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.
@@ Instruction
You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
2. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def encode(message):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    vowels_replace = dict([(i, chr(ord(i) + 2)) for i in vowels])
    message = message.swapcase()
    return ''.join([vowels_replace[i] if i in vowels else i for i in message])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
encode("I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE")
[/INPUT]
@@ Response
[REASONING]
The function encode takes a string message as input and returns the encoded message.

The first step is to create a dictionary vowels_replace that maps each vowel to its next character in the ASCII table.

The second step is to swap the case of the message. This means that all lowercase letters are converted to uppercase and vice versa.

The third step is to iterate over each character in the message. If the character is a vowel, it is replaced by its next character in the ASCII table. If the character is not a vowel, it is left unchanged.

The final step is to join all the characters together into a single string.

For the input "I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE", the output will be "I DpNu KpNu WpHu Tp WpRuTU".

The vowels are replaced by the next character in the ASCII table, and the case of the letters is swapped.
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"I DpNu KpNu WpHu Tp WpRuTU"
[/OUTPUT]<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
