The function `pluck` is called with ( arr = [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2] ).
The condition `len(arr) == 0` is false, so the if branch is not taken.
The `filter` function is used to create a new list with only the even numbers from the input list.
The condition `evens == []` is false, so the if branch is not taken.
The `min` function is used to find the smallest even number in the list.
The `index` function is used to find the index of the smallest even number in the list.
The function returns a list with the smallest even number and its index.

Therefore, the final output of the function `pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])` is [0, 1].
