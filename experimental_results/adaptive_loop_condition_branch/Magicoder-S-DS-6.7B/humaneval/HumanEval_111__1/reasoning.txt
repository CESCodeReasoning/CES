The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'b b b b a' ).
Inside the function, a variable `dict1` is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The input string is split into a list of words.

Iteration 1:
    -The word 'b' appears 4 times in the list, which is more than the current maximum count (0).
    -The maximum count is updated to 4.
Iteration 2:
    -The word 'b' appears 4 times, which is equal to the maximum count.
    -The word 'b' is added to the dictionary with a count of 4.
Iteration 3:
    -The word 'b' appears 4 times, which is equal to the maximum count.
    -The word 'b' is added to the dictionary with a count of 4.
Iteration 4:
    -The word 'b' appears 4 times, which is equal to the maximum count.
    -The word 'b' is added to the dictionary with a count of 4.
Iteration 5:
    -The word 'a' appears 1 time, which is less than the maximum count (4).
    -The word 'a' is not added to the dictionary.

The function returns the dictionary {'b': 4}.
