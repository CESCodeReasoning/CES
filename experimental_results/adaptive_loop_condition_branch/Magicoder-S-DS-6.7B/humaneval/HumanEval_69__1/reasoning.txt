The function `search` is called with ( lst = [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] ).
Inside the function, a list `frq` is initialized with zeros. The length of `frq` is equal to the maximum value in `lst` plus 1.

Iteration 1:
    -The value 8 is found in `lst`, so `frq[8]` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The value 8 is found in `lst`, so `frq[8]` becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The value 8 is found in `lst`, so `frq[8]` becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The value 8 is found in `lst`, so `frq[8]` becomes 4.
Iteration 5:
    -The value 8 is found in `lst`, so `frq[8]` becomes 5.
Iteration 6:
    -The value 8 is found in `lst`, so `frq[8]` becomes 6.
Iteration 7:
    -The value 8 is found in `lst`, so `frq[8]` becomes 7.
Iteration 8:
    -The value 8 is found in `lst`, so `frq[8]` becomes 8.

Iteration 9:
    -The value 9 is not found in `lst`, so `frq[9]` remains 0.
Iteration 10:
    -The value 10 is not found in `lst`, so `frq[10]` remains 0.
Iteration 11:
    -The value 11 is not found in `lst`, so `frq[11]` remains 0.
Iteration 12:
    -The value 12 is not found in `lst`, so `frq[12]` remains 0.
Iteration 13:
    -The value 13 is not found in `lst`, so `frq[13]` remains 0.
Iteration 14:
    -The value 14 is not found in `lst`, so `frq[14]` remains 0.
Iteration 15:
    -The value 15 is not found in `lst`, so `frq[15]` remains 0.

The loop iterates from 1 through 8 (since the length of `frq` is 9).
First Iteration (i = 1)
   - `frq[i]` is 0, which is less than `i` (1).
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Second Iteration (i = 2)
   - `frq[i]` is 0, which is less than `i` (2).
   - The same condition is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Third Iteration (i = 3)
   - `frq[i]` is 0, which is less than `i` (3).
   - The same condition is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `frq[i]` is 0, which is less than `i` (4).
   - The same condition is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `frq[i]` is 0, which is less than `i` (5).
   - The same condition is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Sixth Iteration (i = 6)
   - `frq[i]` is 0, which is less than `i` (6).
   - The same condition is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Seventh Iteration (i = 7)
   - `frq[i]` is 0, which is less than `i` (7).
   - The same condition is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Eighth Iteration (i = 8)
   - `frq[i]` is 0, which is less than `i` (8).
   - The same condition is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `search([8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8])` is -1.
