The function `strange_sort_list` is called with ( lst = []).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
A variable `switch` is initialized to True.
The while loop iterates until `lst` is empty.
First Iteration:
    - lst = [], min(lst) = `ValueError: min() arg is an empty sequence`.
    -`res.append(max(lst))` updates `res` to [].
    -`lst.remove(res[-1])` removes the last element from `lst`.
    -`switch = not switch` updates `switch` to False.
The while loop terminates as `lst` is empty. The function returns the value of `res`, which is now [].
