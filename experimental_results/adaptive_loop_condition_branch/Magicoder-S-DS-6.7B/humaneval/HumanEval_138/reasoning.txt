The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and checks if n is divisible by 2 (i.e., n is even) and if n is greater than or equal to 8.
To determine the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 4, we need to check if 4 is divisible by 2 and if it is greater than or equal to 8.
4 is divisible by 2 (because 2 goes into 4 evenly), but it is not greater than or equal to 8 (because 8 is not greater than 4). Therefore, the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 4 is False.
