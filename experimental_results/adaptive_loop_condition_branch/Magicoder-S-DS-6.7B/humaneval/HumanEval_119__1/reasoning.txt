The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['(()(())', '())())'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `S1` and `S2` are initialized to the concatenation of the first and second elements of the input list.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 0.
Iteration 7:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 8:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 0.
Iteration 9:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes -1.

The function `check` returns False because val is less than 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 0.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so val becomes -1.

The function `check` returns False because val is less than 0.

The function `match_parens` returns 'No' because the function `check` returns False for both `S1` and `S2`.
