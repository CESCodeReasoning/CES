The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through the length of the list (since ( len(lst) = 6 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is true.
    - The first branch is taken.
    - `maxx = lst[i]` updates `maxx` to 8 ( 0 + 8 = 8 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - The condition `(lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i]))` is false.
    - The first branch is not taken.
After the loop completes, the function returns the sum of the digits of `maxx`, which is now 8.
