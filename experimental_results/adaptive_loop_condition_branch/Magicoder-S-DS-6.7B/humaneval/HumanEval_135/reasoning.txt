The function `can_arrange` is called with ( arr = [1,2,4,3,5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( len(arr) = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    - arr[i]=2, arr[i-1]=1
    - The condition `arr[i]<arr[i-1]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - arr[i]=4, arr[i-1]=2
    - The condition `arr[i]<arr[i-1]` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `ind=i` updates `ind` to 2 ( 2 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - arr[i]=3, arr[i-1]=4
    - The condition `arr[i]<arr[i-1]` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `ind=i` updates `ind` to 3 ( 3 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    - arr[i]=5, arr[i-1]=3
    - The condition `arr[i]<arr[i-1]` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `ind=i` updates `ind` to 4 ( 4 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5):
    - arr[i]=None, arr[i-1]=5
    - The condition `arr[i]<arr[i-1]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is now 4.
