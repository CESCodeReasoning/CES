The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [0, 10, 20, 1000000] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 0 is added to `s`, which becomes -0.
    -Since `s` is not less than 0, `s` remains 0.
    -`max_sum` remains 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 10 is added to `s`, which becomes -10.
    -Since `s` is not less than 0, `s` remains 0.
    -`max_sum` remains 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 20 is added to `s`, which becomes -30.
    -Since `s` is not less than 0, `s` remains 0.
    -`max_sum` remains 0.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 1000000 is added to `s`, which becomes -1000030.
    -Since `s` is less than 0, `s` becomes 0.
    -`max_sum` remains 0.

After the loop, `max_sum` is still 0.

Since `max_sum` is 0, the condition `max_sum == 0` is true.

The `else` block's action: `max_sum = max(-i for i in nums)` updates `max_sum` to the maximum negative number in `nums`.

The `min_sum` is calculated as the negative of `max_sum`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([0, 10, 20, 1000000])` is -1000030.
