The function `count_nums` is called with ( arr = [1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5] ).
The function `digits_sum` is defined inside `count_nums`.
The function `digits_sum` is called for each element in the input list.
For each element, if the number is negative, the sign is removed and stored in `neg`.
The number is then converted to a list of digits.
The first digit is multiplied by `neg` to preserve the sign.
The sum of the digits is calculated and returned.
The function `filter` is used to filter out the positive numbers from the list of sums.
The length of the resulting list is returned, which is the count of positive numbers in the input list.

Therefore, the final output of the function `count_nums([1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5])` is 5.
