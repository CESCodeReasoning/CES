The function filter_by_prefix takes a list of strings and a prefix as input. It returns a new list that contains only the strings from the input list that start with the given prefix.

To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_prefix on the input [], we need to filter out the strings that start with 'john'. Since the input list is empty, there are no strings that start with 'john', so the output is an empty list.
