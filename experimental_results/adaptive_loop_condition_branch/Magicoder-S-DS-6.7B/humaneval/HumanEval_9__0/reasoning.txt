The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [4, 3, 2, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None and `result` is an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The current number is 4, so running_max becomes 4.
    -The running_max is appended to the result list.
Iteration 2:
    -The current number is 3, so running_max becomes 4 (max(4, 3) = 4).
    -The running_max is appended to the result list.
Iteration 3:
    -The current number is 2, so running_max becomes 4 (max(4, 2) = 4).
    -The running_max is appended to the result list.
Iteration 4:
    -The current number is 1, so running_max becomes 4 (max(4, 1) = 4).
    -The running_max is appended to the result list.
