The function is_bored takes a string S as input and returns the number of sentences in S that start with "I ".
To determine the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "Hello world", we need to count the number of sentences in "Hello world" that start with "I ".

The function is_bored uses the re.split function to split the input string S into sentences. The regular expression r'[.?!]\s*' is used to split the string at each occurrence of a period, exclamation point, or question mark followed by zero or more whitespace characters.

The sum function is then used to count the number of sentences in the list of sentences that start with "I ". The condition sentence[0:2] == 'I ' checks if the first two characters of each sentence are "I ".

Since there is no sentence in "Hello world" that starts with "I ", the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "Hello world" is 0.
