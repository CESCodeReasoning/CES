The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input and returns a new string.

The function splits the input string s into a list of words using the split() method.

For each word in the list, it sorts the characters in the word using the sorted() function and joins them back into a string using the join() method.

Finally, it joins all the sorted words back into a single string using the join() method.

If the input string is an empty string, the function will return an empty string.
