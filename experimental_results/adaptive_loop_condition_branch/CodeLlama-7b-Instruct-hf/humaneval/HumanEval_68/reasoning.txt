The function `pluck` is called with ( arr = [4,2,3] ).
The condition `len(arr) == 0` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The variable `evens` is initialized to the list of even numbers in `arr` using the `filter` method.
The condition `evens == []` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The method returns a list containing the minimum value of `evens` and the index of that value in `arr`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `pluck([4,2,3])` is [2, 1].
