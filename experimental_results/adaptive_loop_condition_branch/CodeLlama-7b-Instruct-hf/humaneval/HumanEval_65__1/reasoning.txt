The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 12, shift = 1 ).
`x` is 12, which is a positive integer.
`shift` is 1, which is less than the length of the string representation of `x` (i.e., 2).
Therefore, the if branch is taken and the method returns the string representation of `x` in reverse order.

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(12, 1)` is "21".
