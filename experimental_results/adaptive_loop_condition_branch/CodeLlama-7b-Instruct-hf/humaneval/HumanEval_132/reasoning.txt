The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = '[[]]' ).
Inside the function, three lists are created: `opening_bracket_index`, `closing_bracket_index`, and `cnt`.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '[' is added to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '[' is added to `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ']' is added to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ']' is added to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ']' is added to `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ']' is added to `closing_bracket_index`.

The `closing_bracket_index` list is reversed.

Iteration 1:
    -The index of the last ']' is 4.
Iteration 2:
    -The index of the second last ']' is 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The index of the third last ']' is 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The index of the fourth last ']' is 1.
Iteration 5:
    -The index of the fifth last ']' is 0.

The `opening_bracket_index` list is iterated over.

Iteration 1:
    -The index of the first '[' is 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The index of the second '[' is 1.

The `closing_bracket_index` list is iterated over in reverse.

Iteration 1:
    -The index of the last ']' is 4.
Iteration 2:
    -The index of the second last ']' is 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The index of the third last ']' is 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The index of the fourth last ']' is 1.
Iteration 5:
    -The index of the fifth last ']' is 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The value of `l` is 5.
Iteration 2:
    -The value of `l` is 5.

Iteration 1:
    -The value of `idx` is 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The value of `idx` is 1.
