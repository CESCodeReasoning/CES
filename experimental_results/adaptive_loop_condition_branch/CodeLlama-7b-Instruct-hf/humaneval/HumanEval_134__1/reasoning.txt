The function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter takes a string txt as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the last character of the string is a letter.
To determine the output of executing the function on the input "A", we need to split the string into words using the space character as the delimiter.
The last word in the list of words is "A".
To determine whether the last character of the word "A" is a letter, we need to check whether the length of the word is 1 and whether the character is a lowercase letter.
Therefore, the output of executing the function on the input "A" is True.
