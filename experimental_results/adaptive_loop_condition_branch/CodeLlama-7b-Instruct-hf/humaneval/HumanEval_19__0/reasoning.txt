The function sort_numbers takes a string of space-separated numbers as input and returns a sorted string of the same numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_numbers on the input '', we need to sort the empty string.
Since the input string is empty, the sorted string is also empty.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_numbers on the input '' is ''.
