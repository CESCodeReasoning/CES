The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Wow' ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the length of the input string.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of the input string is 3, so `l` becomes 3.
Iteration 2:
    -The length of the input string is 3, so `l` remains 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The length of the input string is 3, so `l` remains 3.

The function returns `True` because the length of the input string is 3, which is a prime number.
