The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` is initialized to 0.
A variable `s` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the elements of `nums`.
First Iteration:
   - `num` is 2, so `s` becomes 2.
   - The condition `s < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - `max_sum` is updated to 2.
Second Iteration:
   - `num` is 3, so `s` becomes 5.
   - The condition `s < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - `max_sum` is updated to 5.
Third Iteration:
   - `num` is 4, so `s` becomes 9.
   - The condition `s < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - `max_sum` is updated to 9.
Fourth Iteration:
   - `num` is 1, so `s` becomes 10.
   - The condition `s < 0` is true, so the branch is taken.
   - `s` becomes 0.
   - `max_sum` is updated to 10.
Fifth Iteration:
   - `num` is 2, so `s` becomes 2.
   - The condition `s < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - `max_sum` is updated to 12.
Sixth Iteration:
   - `num` is 4, so `s` becomes 6.
   - The condition `s < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - `max_sum` is updated to 16.
The loop completes, and `max_sum` is returned.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4])` is 16.
