The function `is_prime` is called with ( n = 6 ).
Inside the function, a conditional statement checks if n is less than 2.
First Iteration:
   - `n` is 6, which is not less than 2.
   - The condition `n < 2` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is executed.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `False`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_prime(6)` is False.
