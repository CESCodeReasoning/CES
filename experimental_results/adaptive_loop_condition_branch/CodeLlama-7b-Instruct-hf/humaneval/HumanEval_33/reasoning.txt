The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a new list with the third element of l sorted.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to sort the third element of the list, which is 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3].
