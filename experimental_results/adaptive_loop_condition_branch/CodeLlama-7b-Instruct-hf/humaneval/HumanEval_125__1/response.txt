<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
3. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
4. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
5. Enclose the annotated code with [PYTHON] AND [/PYTHON]
6. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

Bellow are some examples:

[/QUESTION]

[REASONING]
The function `sum_of_integer` is called with ( N = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `sum_1` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( N = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which satisfies ( 1 <= i < 3 ).
   - The condition `i >= 1 and i < 3` is true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 1` results in `sum_1 = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which still satisfies ( 1 <=i < 3 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 1` updates `sum_1` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which now satisfies ( 3 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `i < 5` is true (while the first condition `i >= 1 and i < 3` is false).
   - Action: `sum_1 += 2` updates `sum_1` to 4 (`2 + 2 = 4`).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, also satisfying ( 3 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `i < 5` is still true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 2` updates `sum_1` to 6 (`4 + 2 = 6`).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, now outside the previous conditions, falling into the `else` block.
   - The `else` block's action: `sum_1 *= 4` updates `sum_1` to 24 (`6 * 4 = 24`).
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `sum_1`, which is now 24.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_of_integer(5)` is 24.

[REASONING]
The function `check_integer` is called with ( i = 4 ).
`i` is 2, which doesn't satisfy ( 1 <= i < 3 ).The condition `i >= 1` and `i < 3` is False. The first branch is not taken.
i = 2 satisfies (i<2). The condition `i<5` is Ture, the second branch is taken.

Therefore, the final output of the function `check_integer(2)` is 1.
