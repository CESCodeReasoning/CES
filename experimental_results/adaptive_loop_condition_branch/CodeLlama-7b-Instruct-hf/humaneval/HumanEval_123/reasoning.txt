The function `get_odd_collatz` is called with ( n = 14 ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_collatz` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates while ( n > 1 ).
First Iteration (n = 14):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=14
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `n = n*3 + 1` updates n to 40.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is true. The if branch is taken.
    - `odd_collatz.append(int(n))` appends 40 to the list.
Second Iteration (n = 40):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=40
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The if branch is taken.
    - `n = n/2` updates n to 20.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `odd_collatz.append(int(n))` appends 20 to the list.
Third Iteration (n = 20):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=20
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The if branch is taken.
    - `n = n/2` updates n to 10.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `odd_collatz.append(int(n))` appends 10 to the list.
Fourth Iteration (n = 10):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=10
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The if branch is taken.
    - `n = n/2` updates n to 5.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `odd_collatz.append(int(n))` appends 5 to the list.
Fifth Iteration (n = 5):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=5
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The if branch is taken.
    - `n = n/2` updates n to 2.5.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `odd_collatz.append(int(n))` appends 2 to the list.
After the loop completes, the function returns the sorted list of odd Collatz numbers, which is [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39].
