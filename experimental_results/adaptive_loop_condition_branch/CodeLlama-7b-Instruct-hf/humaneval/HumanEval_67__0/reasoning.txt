The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "2 apples and 3 oranges", n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `lis` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The string "2" is split into a list of characters.
    -The character '2' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.
Iteration 2:
    -The string "apples" is split into a list of characters.
    -The character 'a' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.
    -The character 'p' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.
    -The character 'p' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.
    -The character 'l' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.
    -The character 'e' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.
    -The character 's' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.
Iteration 3:
    -The string "and" is split into a list of characters.
    -The character 'a' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.
    -The character 'n' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.
    -The character 'd' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.
Iteration 4:
    -The string "3" is split into a list of characters.
    -The character '3' is a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `Y`.
    -The character '3' is appended to the list `lis`.
Iteration 5:
    -The string "oranges" is split into a list of characters.
    -The character 'o' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.
    -The character 'r' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.
    -The character 'a' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.
    -The character 'n' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.
    -The character 'g' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.
    -The character 'e' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.
    -The character 's' is not a digit, so the branch `taken` is marked as `N`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `n - sum(lis)`, which is 5 - 3 = 2.
