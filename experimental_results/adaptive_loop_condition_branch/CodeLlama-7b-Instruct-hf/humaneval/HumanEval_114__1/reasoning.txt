The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [0, 10, 20, 1000000] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` is initialized to 0.
A variable `s` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the list `nums`.
First Iteration:
   - `num` is 0, which is negative.
   - `s` becomes -0.
   - The condition `s < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - `max_sum` is updated to 0.
Second Iteration:
   - `num` is 10, which is positive.
   - `s` becomes -10.
   - The condition `s < 0` is true, so the branch is taken.
   - `s` becomes 0.
   - `max_sum` is updated to 0.
Third Iteration:
   - `num` is 20, which is positive.
   - `s` becomes -20.
   - The condition `s < 0` is true, so the branch is taken.
   - `s` becomes 0.
   - `max_sum` is updated to 0.
Fourth Iteration:
   - `num` is 1000000, which is positive.
   - `s` becomes -1000000.
   - The condition `s < 0` is true, so the branch is taken.
   - `s` becomes 0.
   - `max_sum` is updated to 0.
Return Statement:
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `max_sum`, which is 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([0, 10, 20, 1000000])` is 0.
