The function filter_integers takes a list of values of type Any and returns a list of integers that are present in the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b'], we need to iterate over the input list and filter out the elements that are not of type int.
Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b'] is [3, 3, 3].
