The function `string_xor` is called with ( a = '111000', b = '101010' ).
The function uses a nested function `xor` to perform the XOR operation on each pair of corresponding characters in the two strings.
The `xor` function takes two characters `i` and `j` as input and returns the XOR of `i` and `j`.
The `xor` function first checks if `i` and `j` are equal.
If they are equal, the function returns '0'.
If they are not equal, the function returns '1'.
The `xor` function is then called for each pair of corresponding characters in the two strings using the `zip` function.
The resulting list of XOR values is then joined into a single string using the `join` method.

Therefore, the final output of the function `string_xor('111000', '101010')` is '010101'.
