The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1 ).
The condition `k == 0` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken and the method proceeds to the next line.
The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
The last `k` elements of the sorted array are returned and stored in `ans`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1)` is [2].
