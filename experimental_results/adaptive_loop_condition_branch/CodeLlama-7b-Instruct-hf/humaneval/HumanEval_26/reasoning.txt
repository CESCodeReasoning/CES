The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with all duplicates removed.
To do this, the function first imports the collections module and creates a counter object c that counts the frequency of each integer in the input list.
Next, the function creates a new list that contains only the integers that appear once or less in the input list.
This is done by iterating over the input list and adding each integer to the new list only if its frequency is less than or equal to 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5] is [1, 2, 4, 5].
