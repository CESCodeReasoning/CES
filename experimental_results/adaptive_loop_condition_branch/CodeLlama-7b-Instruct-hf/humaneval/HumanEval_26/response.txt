<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    import collections
    c = collections.Counter(numbers)
    return [n for n in numbers if c[n] <= 1]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[REASONING]
The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with all duplicates removed.
To do this, the function first imports the collections module and creates a counter object c that counts the frequency of each integer in the input list.
Next, the function creates a new list that contains only the integers that appear once or less in the input list.
This is done by iterating over the input list and adding each integer to the new list only if its frequency is less than or equal to 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5] is [1, 2, 4, 5].
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[1, 2, 4, 5]
[/OUTPUT]</s>
