The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through the range of 1 to n+1.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the range.
First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
    - `i` is even, so the if branch is taken.
    - `x` is initialized to 1.
    - `j` is 2, so `x` is multiplied by 2.
    - `j` is 3, so `x` is multiplied by 3.
    - `j` is 4, so `x` is multiplied by 4.
    - `j` is 5, so `x` is multiplied by 5.
    - `j` is 6, so `x` is multiplied by 6.
    - `j` is 7, so `x` is multiplied by 7.
    - Append `x` to `ret`.
Second Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
    - `i` is even, so the if branch is taken.
    - `x` is initialized to 1.
    - `j` is 3, so `x` is multiplied by 3.
    - `j` is 4, so `x` is multiplied by 4.
    - `j` is 5, so `x` is multiplied by 5.
    - `j` is 6, so `x` is multiplied by 6.
    - `j` is 7, so `x` is multiplied by 7.
    - Append `x` to `ret`.
Third Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4, 5, 6, 7.
    - `i` is even, so the if branch is taken.
    - `x` is initialized to 1.
    - `j` is 4, so `x` is multiplied by 4.
    - `j` is 5, so `x` is multiplied by 5.
    - `j` is 6, so `x` is multiplied by 6.
    - `j` is 7, so `x` is multiplied by 7.
    - Append `x` to `ret`.
Forth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5, 6, 7.
    - `i` is even, so the if branch is taken.
    - `x` is initialized to 1.
    - `j` is 5, so `x` is multiplied by 5.
    - `j` is 6, so `x` is multiplied by 6.
    - `j` is 7, so `x` is multiplied by 7.
    - Append `x` to `ret`.
Fifth Iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, j in the inner loop is 6, 7.
    - `i` is even, so the if branch is taken.
    - `x` is initialized to 1.
    - `j` is 6, so `x` is multiplied by 6.
    - `j` is 7, so `x` is multiplied by 7.
    - Append `x` to `ret`.
Sixth Iteration (i=6):
    - `i` is 6, j in the inner loop is 7.
    - `i` is even, so the if branch is taken.
    - `x` is initialized to 1.
    - `j` is 7, so `x` is multiplied by 7.
    - Append `x` to `ret`.
Seventh Iteration (i=7):
    - `i` is 7, j in the inner loop is empty.
    - `i` is odd, so the else branch is taken.
    - `x` is initialized to 0.
    - `j` is 1, so `x` is added by 1.
    - `j` is 2, so `x` is added by 2.
    - `j` is 3, so `x` is added by 3.
    - `j` is 4, so `x` is added by 4.
    - `j` is 5, so `x` is added by 5.
    - `j` is 6, so `x` is added by 6.
    - `j` is 7, so `x` is added by 7.
    - Append `x` to `ret`.
