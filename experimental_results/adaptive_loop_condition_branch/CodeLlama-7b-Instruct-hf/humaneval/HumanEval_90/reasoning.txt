The function next_smallest takes a list of integers lst as input and returns the next smallest element in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we need to follow these steps:

1. Sort the list of integers lst to get a sorted list of unique elements.
2. If the length of the sorted list is less than 2, return None.
3. Otherwise, return the second element of the sorted list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 2.
