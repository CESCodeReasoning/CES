The function find_max takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "enam", "game"], we need to sort the list of strings based on their length in descending order.
Since "game" has the longest length, it will be the first element in the sorted list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "enam", "game"] is "game".
