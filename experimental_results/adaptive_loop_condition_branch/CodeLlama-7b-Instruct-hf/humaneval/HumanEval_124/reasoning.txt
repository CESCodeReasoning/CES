The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '03-11-2000' ).
`date` is '03-11-2000', which is a string.
The try block is executed.
`date` is stripped of whitespace characters.
`date` is split into three parts: month, day, and year.
`month`, `day`, and `year` are assigned the values 03, 11, and 2000, respectively.
`month`, `day`, and `year` are converted to integers.
The condition `month < 1 or month > 12` is false, therefore the first if branch is not taken.
The condition `month in [1,3,5,7,8,10,12] and day < 1 or day > 31` is true, therefore the second if branch is taken.
The method returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('03-11-2000')` is False.
