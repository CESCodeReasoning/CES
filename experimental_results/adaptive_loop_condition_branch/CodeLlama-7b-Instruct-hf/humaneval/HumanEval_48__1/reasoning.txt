The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'aaaaa' ).
Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 to the length of the text (since ( len(text) = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `text[i]` is 'a', which is equal to `text[len(text) - 1 - i]`.
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
   - Action: `return True` is executed.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `text[i]` is 'a', which is equal to `text[len(text) - 1 - i]`.
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `return True` is executed.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `text[i]` is 'a', which is equal to `text[len(text) - 1 - i]`.
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `return True` is executed.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `text[i]` is 'a', which is equal to `text[len(text) - 1 - i]`.
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `return True` is executed.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `text[i]` is 'a', which is equal to `text[len(text) - 1 - i]`.
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `return True` is executed.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `True`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_palindrome('aaaaa')` is `True`.
