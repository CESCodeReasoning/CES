The function right_angle_triangle takes three side lengths a, b, and c as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the triangle is a right angle triangle.
To determine whether the triangle is a right angle triangle, we need to check whether the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides is equal to the square of the longest side.
In this case, the longest side is c, and the two shorter sides are a and b.
Therefore, we need to check whether a*a + b*b == c*c.
If this condition is true, then the triangle is a right angle triangle.
