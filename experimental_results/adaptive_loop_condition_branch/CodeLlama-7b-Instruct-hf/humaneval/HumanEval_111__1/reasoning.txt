The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'b b b b a' ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `dict1` is initialized to an empty dictionary.
A list `list1` is created by splitting the input string on spaces.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'b' is not in the dictionary, so the count is 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'b' is already in the dictionary, so the count is 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'b' is already in the dictionary, so the count is 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'b' is already in the dictionary, so the count is 4.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 'a' is not in the dictionary, so the count is 1.

The maximum count is 4, so the dictionary `dict1` is updated with the key-value pair ('b', 4).

The function returns the dictionary `dict1`.
