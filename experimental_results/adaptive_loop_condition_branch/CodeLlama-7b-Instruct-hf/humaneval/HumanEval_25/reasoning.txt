The function `factorize` is called with ( n = 2 ).
Inside the function, a variable `fact` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 2 through the square root of n (since ( n = 2 )).
First Iteration (i = 2):
    - i <= int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) when i=2 and int((math.sqrt(n) + 1))=3
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `i += 1` updates `i` to 3.
Second Iteration (i = 3):
    - i <= int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) when i=3 and int((math.sqrt(n) + 1))=3
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `i += 1` updates `i` to 4.
Third Iteration (i = 4):
    - i <= int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) when i=4 and int((math.sqrt(n) + 1))=3
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `i += 1` updates `i` to 5.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `fact`, which is now [2].
