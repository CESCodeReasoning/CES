The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string that represents the sequence of numbers from 1 to n, separated by a space.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3, we need to create a list of strings that represent the numbers from 1 to 3, and then join them together with a space.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3 is "1 2 3".
