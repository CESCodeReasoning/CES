The function `by_length` is called with an empty list `arr`.
Inside the function, a dictionary `dic` is defined with key-value pairs where the key is the length of a word and the value is the word itself.
The list `sorted_arr` is sorted in reverse order using the `sorted` function.
The loop iterates over the sorted list `sorted_arr`.

First Iteration:
    `var` = [] (since `sorted_arr` is an empty list)
    `dic[var]` raises a `KeyError` since there is no key in `dic` that matches the empty list `var`.
    The `try-except` block catches the `KeyError` and the `pass` statement is executed.
    The loop continues to the next iteration.

Second Iteration:
    `var` = [] (since `sorted_arr` is an empty list)
    `dic[var]` raises a `KeyError` since there is no key in `dic` that matches the empty list `var`.
    The `try-except` block catches the `KeyError` and the `pass` statement is executed.
    The loop continues to the next iteration.

Third Iteration:
    `var` = [] (since `sorted_arr` is an empty list)
    `dic[var]` raises a `KeyError` since there is no key in `dic` that matches the empty list `var`.
    The `try-except` block catches the `KeyError` and the `pass` statement is executed.
    The loop continues to the next iteration.

Fourth Iteration:
    `var` = [] (since `sorted_arr` is an empty list)
    `dic[var]` raises a `KeyError` since there is no key in `dic` that matches the empty list `var`.
    The `try-except` block catches the `KeyError` and the `pass` statement is executed.
    The loop continues to the next iteration.

Fifth Iteration:
    `var` = [] (since `sorted_arr` is an empty list)
    `dic[var]` raises a `KeyError` since there is no key in `dic` that matches the empty list `var`.
    The `try-except` block catches the `KeyError` and the `pass` statement is executed.
    The loop continues to the next iteration.

After the loop completes, the function returns an empty list `new_arr`.
