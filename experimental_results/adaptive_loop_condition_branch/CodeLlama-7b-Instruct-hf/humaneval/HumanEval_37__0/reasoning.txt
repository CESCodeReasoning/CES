The function `sort_even` is called with ( l = [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] ).
Inside the function, a variable `evens` is initialized to the list of even elements of l ( l[::2] ).
The variable `odds` is initialized to the list of odd elements of l ( l[1::2] ).
The list `evens` is sorted using the `sort` method.
The loop iterates from 0 through 4 (since ( len(evens) = 5 )).
First Iteration (e = -5, o = 3):
    `ans.extend([e, o])` appends -5 and 3 to `ans`.
Second Iteration (e = 2, o = -3):
    `ans.extend([e, o])` appends 2 and -3 to `ans`.
Third Iteration (e = 3, o = -10):
    `ans.extend([e, o])` appends 3 and -10 to `ans`.
Fourth Iteration (e = 9, o = 1):
    `ans.extend([e, o])` appends 9 and 1 to `ans`.
Fifth Iteration (e = 123, o = 5):
    `ans.extend([e, o])` appends 123 and 5 to `ans`.
After the loop completes, the condition ( len(evens) > len(odds) ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken and the function returns `ans` as the output.
