The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "yogurt" ).
Inside the function, a set `vowels` is created with the vowels in the English language.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of word is 6, so the condition (len(word) < 3) is false.
    -The loop iterates from (len(word)-2) to 0 with a step of -1.
    -The first iteration checks if the first character 'y' is in vowels.
    -The condition (word[i] in vowels) is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 2:
    -The second iteration checks if the second character 'o' is in vowels.
    -The condition (word[i] in vowels) is true, so the loop breaks.
    -The function returns the vowel 'o'.
