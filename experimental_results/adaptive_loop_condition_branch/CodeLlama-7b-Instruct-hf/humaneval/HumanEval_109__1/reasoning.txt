The function `move_one_ball` is called with ( arr = [3, 5, 4, 1, 2] ).

Step 1:
    - The length of the array is not 0, so the `if` statement is not executed.
Step 2:
    - The array is sorted in ascending order.
Step 3:
    - The array is reversed.
Step 4:
    - The array is sorted in ascending order again.
Step 5:
    - The function returns `True` if the array is in sorted order, and `False` otherwise.

Therefore, the final output of the function `move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])` is `True`.
