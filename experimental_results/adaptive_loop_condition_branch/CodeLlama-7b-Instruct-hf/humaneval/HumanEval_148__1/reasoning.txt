The function `bf` is called with ( planet1 = "Mercury", planet2 = "Uranus" ).
`planet1` is "Mercury", which is not in the tuple `planet_names`.
`planet2` is "Uranus", which is not in the tuple `planet_names`.
The condition `planet1 not in planet_names` and `planet2 not in planet_names` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns ().

Therefore, the final output of the function `bf("Mercury", "Uranus")` is ().
