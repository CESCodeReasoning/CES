The function encode takes a string message as input and returns a new string where all the vowels are replaced by their uppercase counterparts, and all the consonants are replaced by their lowercase counterparts.
To determine the output of executing the function encode on the input "YES", we need to replace all the vowels with their uppercase counterparts and all the consonants with their lowercase counterparts.
Therefore, the output of executing the function encode on the input "YES" is "YeS".
