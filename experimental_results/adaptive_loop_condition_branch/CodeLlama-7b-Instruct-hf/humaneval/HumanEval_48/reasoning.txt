The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'xywyx' ).
Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 to the length of the text (since ( len(text) = 6 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `text[i]` is 'x', which is equal to `text[len(text) - 1 - i]`.
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
   - Action: `return True` is executed.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `text[i]` is 'y', which is not equal to `text[len(text) - 1 - i]`.
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` is executed.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `text[i]` is 'w', which is not equal to `text[len(text) - 1 - i]`.
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` is executed.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `text[i]` is 'y', which is not equal to `text[len(text) - 1 - i]`.
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` is executed.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `text[i]` is 'x', which is equal to `text[len(text) - 1 - i]`.
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
   - Action: `return True` is executed.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `text[i]` is 'x', which is equal to `text[len(text) - 1 - i]`.
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
   - Action: `return True` is executed.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_palindrome('xywyx')` is False.
