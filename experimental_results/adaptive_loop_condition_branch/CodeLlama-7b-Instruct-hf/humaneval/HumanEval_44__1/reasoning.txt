The function `change_base` is called with ( x = 9, base = 3).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to an empty string.
First Iteration:
    - x = 9, x > 0 is true.
    - ret = str(9 % 3) + ret = "2" + "" = "2".
    - x = 9 // 3 = 3.
Second Iteration:
    - x = 3, x > 0 is true.
    - ret = str(3 % 3) + ret = "1" + "2" = "12".
    - x = 3 // 3 = 1.
Third Iteration:
    - x = 1, x > 0 is false. The while loop terminates.
The function returns the value of `ret`, which is now "12".
