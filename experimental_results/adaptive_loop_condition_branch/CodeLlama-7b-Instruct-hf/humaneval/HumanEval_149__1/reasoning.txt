The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of `lst` is "school", which is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element of `lst` is "AI", which is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The third element of `lst` is "asdf", which is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth element of `lst` is "b", which is appended to `new_lst`.

The `new_lst` is then sorted based on the length of the elements.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sorted_list_sum(["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"])` is ["b", "school", "AI", "asdf"].
