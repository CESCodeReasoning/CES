The function reverse_delete takes two arguments: s and c.
s is a string and c is a set of characters.
The function first joins the characters in s that are not in c using the join method.
The resulting string is then returned.
The function also returns a boolean value indicating whether the reversed string of s is equal to s.
To determine the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcde" and "ae", we need to join the characters in "abcde" that are not in "ae" using the join method.
Therefore, the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcde" and "ae" is ("bdf", False).
