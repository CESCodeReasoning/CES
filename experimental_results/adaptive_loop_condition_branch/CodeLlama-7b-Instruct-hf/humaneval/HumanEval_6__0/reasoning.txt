The function `parse_nested_parens` is called with ( paren_string = '((()))' ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` and `max_depth` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
    -max_depth becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 2.
    -max_depth becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 3.
    -max_depth becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 0.

The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the maximum depth of the nested parentheses in the corresponding substring of the input string.
Therefore, the final output of the function `parse_nested_parens('((()))')` is [3].
