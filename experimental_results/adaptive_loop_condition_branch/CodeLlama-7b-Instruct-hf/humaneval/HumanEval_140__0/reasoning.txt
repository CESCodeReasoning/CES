The function `fix_spaces` is called with ( text = "Exa   mple" ).
Inside the function, a variable `new_text` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates through the characters in the input string.
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - i < len(text) when i=0
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken. `new_text` is updated to "Exa".
    - start and end are updated to 0 and 1.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - i < len(text) when i=1
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken. `new_text` is updated to "Exa_mple".
    - start and end are updated to 1 and 2.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - i < len(text) when i=2
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - end is updated to 3.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - i < len(text) when i=3
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken. `new_text` is updated to "Exa_mple_".
    - start and end are updated to 3 and 4.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - i < len(text) when i=4
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - end is updated to 5.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - i < len(text) when i=5
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken. `new_text` is updated to "Exa_mple_-".
    - start and end are updated to 5 and 6.
Seventh Iteration (i = 6):
    - i < len(text) when i=6
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - end is updated to 7.
Eighth Iteration (i = 7):
    - i < len(text) when i=7
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken. `new_text` is updated to "Exa_mple_-_".
    - start and end are updated to 7 and 8.
Ninth Iteration (i = 8):
    - i < len(text) when i=8
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - end is updated to 9.
Tenth Iteration (i = 9):
    - i < len(text) when i=9
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The else branch is taken. `new_text` is updated to "Exa_mple_-_-".
    - start and end are updated to 9 and 10.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `new_text`, which is now "Exa_mple_-_-".
