The function `parse_nested_parens` is called with ( paren_string = '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())' ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` and `max_depth` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
    -max_depth becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 2.
    -max_depth becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
    -max_depth becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ' ' is encountered, so the current group is parsed.
    -The current group has a depth of 2, so max_depth becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
    -max_depth becomes 2.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 2.
    -max_depth becomes 2.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
    -max_depth becomes 2.
Iteration 8:
    -The character ' ' is encountered, so the current group is parsed.
    -The current group has a depth of 1, so max_depth becomes 1.
Iteration 9:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
    -max_depth becomes 1.
Iteration 10:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 2.
    -max_depth becomes 2.
Iteration 11:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
    -max_depth becomes 2.
Iteration 12:
    -The character ' ' is encountered, so the current group is parsed.
    -The current group has a depth of 2, so max_depth becomes 2.
Iteration 13:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
    -max_depth becomes 2.
Iteration 14:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 2.
    -max_depth becomes 2.
Iteration 15:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
    -max_depth becomes 2.
Iteration 16:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 0.
    -max_depth becomes 2.

The final output of the function `parse_nested_parens` is [2, 2, 2, 1, 2].
