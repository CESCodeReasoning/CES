The function `minPath` takes a grid and a number of paths as input.
The function first initializes a variable `val` to a large value.
The outer loop iterates through each row of the grid.
In the inner loop, the function iterates through each column of the grid.
For each cell in the grid, the function checks if the cell has a value of 1.
If the cell has a value of 1, the function initializes a temporary list `temp` and appends the values of the cells in the same row and column as the current cell.
The function then sets the value of `val` to the minimum of the values in the `temp` list.
The function then initializes a list `ans` and appends the value of `val` to it.
The function then repeats the process for the next `k` paths.
