The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [3, 2, -3.5, 0] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list `l`.

Iteration 1:
    -The element `3` is compared with `m`. Since `3` is greater than `m`, `m` is updated to `3`.
Iteration 2:
    -The element `2` is compared with `m`. Since `2` is less than `m`, `m` remains `3`.
Iteration 3:
    -The element `-3.5` is compared with `m`. Since `-3.5` is less than `m`, `m` remains `3`.
Iteration 4:
    -The element `0` is compared with `m`. Since `0` is less than `m`, `m` remains `3`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `max_element([3, 2, -3.5, 0])` is 3.
