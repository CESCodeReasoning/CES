The function filter_integers takes a list of values of type Any and returns a list of integers that are present in the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [], we need to iterate over the input list and check if each element is an integer.
Since the input list is empty, there are no integers in the list, and therefore the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [] is an empty list.
