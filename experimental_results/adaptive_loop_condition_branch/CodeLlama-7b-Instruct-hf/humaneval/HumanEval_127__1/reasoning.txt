The function `intersection` is called with two intervals: (-1, 1) and (0, 4).

The function first defines a helper function `is_prime` that checks if a number is prime.

The function then defines two variables `l` and `r` that represent the left and right endpoints of the intersection of the two intervals.

The function then calculates the length of the intersection by subtracting the left endpoint from the right endpoint.

The function then checks if the length of the intersection is greater than 0 and if the length is prime.

If the length is greater than 0 and prime, the function returns "YES".

If the length is not greater than 0 or not prime, the function returns "NO".

Therefore, the output of the function `intersection([-1, 1], [0, 4])` is "NO".
