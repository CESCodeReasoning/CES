The function `prod_signs` is called with ( arr = [1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1] ).
The condition `not arr` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The method returns the product of the signs of the elements in the array, which is 1 * 1 * 1 * 2 * 3 * -1 * 1 = -6.

Therefore, the final output of the function `prod_signs([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1])` is -6.
