The function `bf` is called with ( planet1 = "Earth", planet2 = "Earth" ).
`planet1` and `planet2` are both "Earth", which satisfies ( planet1 == planet2 ).
The condition `planet1 not in planet_names` and `planet2 not in planet_names` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken and the method returns ().

Therefore, the final output of the function `bf("Earth", "Earth")` is ().
