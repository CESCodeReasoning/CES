The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '01-01-2007' ).
`date` is '01-01-2007', which is a valid date.
The try block is executed.
The `date` variable is assigned to the `date.strip()` method, which removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the string.
The `date` variable is then assigned to the `date.split('-')` method, which splits the string into a list of substrings using the '-' character as a delimiter.
The `month`, `day`, and `year` variables are assigned the values of the first, second, and third elements of the list, respectively.
The `month`, `day`, and `year` variables are then assigned to the `int()` method, which converts the substrings to integers.
The `month` variable is then checked to see if it is less than 1 or greater than 12.
The `month` variable is 1, which satisfies ( month < 1 or month > 12 ).
The condition `month < 1 or month > 12` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('01-01-2007')` is False.
