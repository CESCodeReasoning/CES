The function `longest` is called with ( strings = ['x', 'y', 'z'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxlen` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of 'x' is 1, so maxlen becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The length of 'y' is 1, so maxlen becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The length of 'z' is 1, so maxlen becomes 1.

The condition `not strings` is false, so the `if` block is not executed.

The `for` loop iterates over the list of strings.

Iteration 1:
    -The string 'x' is compared to maxlen. Since the length of 'x' is 1, it is not equal to maxlen, so the `if` block is not executed.
Iteration 2:
    -The string 'y' is compared to maxlen. Since the length of 'y' is 1, it is not equal to maxlen, so the `if` block is not executed.
Iteration 3:
    -The string 'z' is compared to maxlen. Since the length of 'z' is 1, it is not equal to maxlen, so the `if` block is not executed.

The `return` statement is executed, returning the first string in the list, which is 'x'.
