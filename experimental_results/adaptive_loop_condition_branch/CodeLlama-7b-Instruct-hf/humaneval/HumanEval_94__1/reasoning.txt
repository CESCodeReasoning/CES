The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] ).
Inside the function, two inner functions `isPrime` and `result` are defined.
The `isPrime` function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If `n` is not divisible by any of the numbers in the range, then it is prime.
The `result` function takes a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of the digits of the largest prime number in `lst`.

The `maxx` variable is initialized to 0.
The `i` variable is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 to the length of `lst` (since ( i < len(lst) )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])) is false since ( 0 > 0 and isPrime(0) = False ).
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])) is false since ( 8 > 0 and isPrime(8) = False ).
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])) is true since ( 1 > 0 and isPrime(1) = True ).
    - The `maxx` variable is updated to 1.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])) is true since ( 2 > 1 and isPrime(2) = True ).
    - The `maxx` variable is updated to 2.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])) is false since ( 1 > 2 and isPrime(1) = False ).
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - The condition (lst[i] > maxx and isPrime(lst[i])) is true since ( 7 > 2 and isPrime(7) = True ).
    - The `maxx` variable is updated to 7.
After the loop completes, the `result` function is called with ( lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] ) as input.
The `result` function returns the sum of the digits of the largest prime number in `lst`, which is 7.
Therefore, the final output of the function `skjkasdkd([0,8,1,2,1,7])` is 7.
