The function filter_integers takes a list of values of type Any as input and returns a list of integers that are present in the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [4, {}, [], 23.2, 9, 'adasd'], we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to iterate over the input list and check if each element is an integer.
2. If an element is an integer, we add it to the output list.
3. If an element is not an integer, we skip it.

Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [4, {}, [], 23.2, 9, 'adasd'] is [4, 9].
