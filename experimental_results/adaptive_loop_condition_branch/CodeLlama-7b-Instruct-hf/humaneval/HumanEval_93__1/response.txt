<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def encode(message):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    vowels_replace = dict([(i, chr(ord(i) + 2)) for i in vowels])
    message = message.swapcase()
    return ''.join([vowels_replace[i] if i in vowels else i for i in message])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
encode("I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE")
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  [REASONING]
The function encode takes a string message as input and returns a new string where all vowels are replaced by their uppercase counterparts, and all consonants are replaced by their lowercase counterparts.
To determine the output of executing the function encode on the input "I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE", we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to create a dictionary that maps each vowel to its uppercase counterpart. This dictionary is created using a list comprehension, where each vowel is mapped to its uppercase counterpart using the formula chr(ord(i) + 2).
2. Next, we need to swap the case of the input string, which is done using the swapcase() method.
3. Then, we need to iterate over each character in the input string and replace it with its corresponding value in the dictionary created in step 1. If the character is a vowel, we replace it with its uppercase counterpart, and if it is a consonant, we replace it with its lowercase counterpart.
4. Finally, we need to join the resulting list of characters into a single string using the join() method.
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"i dOnT kNoW wHaT tO wRiTe"
[/OUTPUT]</s>
