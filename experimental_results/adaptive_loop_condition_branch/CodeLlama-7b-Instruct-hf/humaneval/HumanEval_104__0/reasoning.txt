The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [135, 103, 31] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_digit_elements` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 135 is a 3-digit number, and all its digits are odd (1, 3, and 5).
    -The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is true, so the number is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 103 is a 3-digit number, and all its digits are odd (1, 0, and 3).
    -The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is true, so the number is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 31 is a 2-digit number, and only its first digit is odd (3).
    -The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is false, so the number is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `unique_digits([135, 103, 31])` is [135, 103].
