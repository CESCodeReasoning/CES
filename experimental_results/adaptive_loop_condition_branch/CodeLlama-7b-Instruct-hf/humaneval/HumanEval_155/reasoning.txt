The function `even_odd_count` is called with ( num = 7 ).
Inside the function, two variables `even_count` and `odd_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '7' is not even, so odd_count becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '7' is not even, so odd_count becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '7' is not even, so odd_count becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '7' is not even, so odd_count becomes 4.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '7' is not even, so odd_count becomes 5.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '7' is not even, so odd_count becomes 6.
Iteration 7:
    -The character '7' is not even, so odd_count becomes 7.

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_count(7)` is (0, 7).
