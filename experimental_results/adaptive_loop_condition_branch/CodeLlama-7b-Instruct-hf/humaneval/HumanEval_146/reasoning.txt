The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [5, -2, 1, -5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 5 is greater than 10, so the first branch is taken.
    -The variable `odd_digits` is initialized to (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    -The number 5 is converted to a string, which is "5".
    -The first digit of "5" is 5, which is an odd digit.
    -The last digit of "5" is 5, which is an odd digit.
    -The condition `int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits` is true, so the count is incremented by 1.
    -The count is now 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The number -2 is less than 10, so the second branch is not taken.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 1 is greater than 10, so the first branch is taken.
    -The variable `odd_digits` is initialized to (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    -The number 1 is converted to a string, which is "1".
    -The first digit of "1" is 1, which is an odd digit.
    -The last digit of "1" is 1, which is an odd digit.
    -The condition `int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits` is true, so the count is incremented by 1.
    -The count is now 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The number -5 is less than 10, so the second branch is not taken.

Therefore, the final output of the function `specialFilter([5, -2, 1, -5])` is 2.
