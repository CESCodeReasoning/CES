The function `encrypt` is called with ( s = 'asdfghjkl' ).
Inside the function, a variable `d` is initialized to 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'a' is in d, so out becomes 'c'.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 's' is not in d, so out becomes 'cs'.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'd' is in d, so out becomes 'csd'.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'f' is in d, so out becomes 'csdf'.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 'g' is not in d, so out becomes 'csdfg'.
Iteration 6:
    -The character 'h' is not in d, so out becomes 'csdfgh'.
Iteration 7:
    -The character 'j' is not in d, so out becomes 'csdfghj'.
Iteration 8:
    -The character 'k' is not in d, so out becomes 'csdfghjk'.
Iteration 9:
    -The character 'l' is not in d, so out becomes 'csdfghjkl'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `encrypt('asdfghjkl')` is 'csdfghjkl'.
