The function `exchange` is called with ( lst1 = [100, 200], lst2 = [200, 200] ).
Inside the function, two variables `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The element 100 in lst1 is odd, so odd becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 200 in lst1 is even, so even becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The element 200 in lst2 is even, so even becomes 2.

Since even is greater than or equal to odd, the function returns "YES".
