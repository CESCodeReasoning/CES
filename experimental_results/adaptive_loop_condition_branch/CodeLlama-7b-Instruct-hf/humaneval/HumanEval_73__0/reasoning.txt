The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1, 4, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `i` is 0, so `arr[i]` is 1 and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 4.
    - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true, so `ans` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    - `i` is 1, so `arr[i]` is 4 and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 2.
    - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is false, so `ans` remains 1.
Iteration 3:
    - `i` is 2, so `arr[i]` is 2 and `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 1.
    - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true, so `ans` becomes 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1, 4, 2])` is 2.
