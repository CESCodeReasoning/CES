The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The value of `i` is 0, and the value of `arr[i]` is 1.
    - The value of `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 2.
    - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is false, so the branch is not taken.
    - The value of `ans` remains 0.
Iteration 2:
    - The value of `i` is 1, and the value of `arr[i]` is 2.
    - The value of `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 1.
    - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true, so the branch is taken.
    - The value of `ans` becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    - The value of `i` is 2, and the value of `arr[i]` is 3.
    - The value of `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 4.
    - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is false, so the branch is not taken.
    - The value of `ans` remains 1.
Iteration 4:
    - The value of `i` is 3, and the value of `arr[i]` is 3.
    - The value of `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 3.
    - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is false, so the branch is not taken.
    - The value of `ans` remains 1.
Iteration 5:
    - The value of `i` is 4, and the value of `arr[i]` is 2.
    - The value of `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 2.
    - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is false, so the branch is not taken.
    - The value of `ans` remains 1.
Iteration 6:
    - The value of `i` is 5, and the value of `arr[i]` is 2.
    - The value of `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 2.
    - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is false, so the branch is not taken.
    - The value of `ans` remains 1.
Iteration 7:
    - The value of `i` is 6, and the value of `arr[i]` is 2.
    - The value of `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is 2.
    - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is false, so the branch is not taken.
    - The value of `ans` remains 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2])` is 1.
