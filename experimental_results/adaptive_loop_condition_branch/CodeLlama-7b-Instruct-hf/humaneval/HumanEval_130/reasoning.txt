The function `tri` is called with ( n = 3 ).
Inside the function, a variable `my_tri` is initialized to [1, 3].

Iteration 1:
    -The condition `n == 0` is false, so the first branch is not taken.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true, so the second branch is taken.
    -The action `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` appends 2 to `my_tri`, making it [1, 3, 2].
Iteration 2:
    -The condition `n == 0` is false, so the first branch is not taken.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false, so the second branch is not taken.
    -The action `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` appends 3 to `my_tri`, making it [1, 3, 2, 3].
Iteration 3:
    -The condition `n == 0` is false, so the first branch is not taken.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true, so the second branch is taken.
    -The action `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` appends 4 to `my_tri`, making it [1, 3, 2, 3, 4].

Therefore, the final output of the function `tri(3)` is [1, 3, 2, 3, 4].
