The function get_row takes a list of lists lst and an integer x as input. It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row and column indices of the element in lst that is equal to x.
To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3, we need to find the indices of the element 3 in the list [1, 2, 3].
The row index is 1 and the column index is 2. Therefore, the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3 is [(1, 2)].
