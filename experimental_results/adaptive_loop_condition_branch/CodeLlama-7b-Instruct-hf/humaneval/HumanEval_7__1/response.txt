<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if substring in x]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
filter_by_substring(['xxx', 'asd', 'aaaxxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xx')
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[REASONING]
The function filter_by_substring takes two arguments: a list of strings (strings) and a string (substring).
It returns a new list containing only the strings from the original list that contain the substring.

To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'aaaxxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xx', we need to apply the following steps:

1. The function creates a new list (result) to store the filtered strings.
2. It iterates over the input list (strings) and checks if each string contains the substring (substring).
3. If a string contains the substring, it is added to the result list.
4. The function returns the result list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_by_substring on the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'aaaxxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xx' is ['xxx', 'aaaxxy', 'xxxAAA'].
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
['xxx', 'aaaxxy', 'xxxAAA']
[/OUTPUT]</s>
