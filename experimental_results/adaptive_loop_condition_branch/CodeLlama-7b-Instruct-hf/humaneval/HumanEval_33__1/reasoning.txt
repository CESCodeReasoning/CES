The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of the third element of each triplet in l.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10], we need to sort the third element of each triplet in l.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10] is [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10].
