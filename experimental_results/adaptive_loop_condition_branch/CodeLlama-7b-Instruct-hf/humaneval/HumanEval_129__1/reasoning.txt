The function `minPath` takes a grid and a number of paths as input.
The function first initializes a variable `val` to a large value, which is the minimum value of the path.
The outer loop iterates through each row of the grid.
In the inner loop, the function iterates through each column of the grid.
For each cell in the grid, the function checks if the cell value is equal to 1.
If the cell value is equal to 1, the function initializes a temporary list `temp` and appends the values of the cells in the same row and column as the current cell.
The function then sets the value of `val` to the minimum of the temporary list.
The function then initializes an empty list `ans` and iterates through each path.
For each path, the function checks if the path is even or odd.
If the path is even, the function appends 1 to the `ans` list.
If the path is odd, the function appends the value of `val` to the `ans` list.
The function then returns the `ans` list.
