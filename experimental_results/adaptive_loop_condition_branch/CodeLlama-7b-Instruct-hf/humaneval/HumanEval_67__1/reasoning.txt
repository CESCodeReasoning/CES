The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "5 apples and 6 oranges", n = 21 ).
Inside the function, a variable `lis` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The string "5" is split into a list of characters.
    -The character '5' is not a digit, so the branch `else` is taken.
    -The character '5' is appended to the list `lis`.
Iteration 2:
    -The string "apples" is split into a list of characters.
    -The character 'a' is not a digit, so the branch `else` is taken.
    -The character 'p' is appended to the list `lis`.
    -The character 'p' is appended to the list `lis`.
    -The character 'l' is not a digit, so the branch `else` is taken.
    -The character 'e' is appended to the list `lis`.
    -The character 's' is not a digit, so the branch `else` is taken.
    -The character 'a' is appended to the list `lis`.
Iteration 3:
    -The string "and" is split into a list of characters.
    -The character 'a' is not a digit, so the branch `else` is taken.
    -The character 'n' is appended to the list `lis`.
    -The character 'd' is not a digit, so the branch `else` is taken.
    -The character 'a' is appended to the list `lis`.
Iteration 4:
    -The string "6" is split into a list of characters.
    -The character '6' is a digit, so the branch `if` is taken.
    -The character '6' is appended to the list `lis`.
Iteration 5:
    -The string "oranges" is split into a list of characters.
    -The character 'o' is not a digit, so the branch `else` is taken.
    -The character 'r' is appended to the list `lis`.
    -The character 'a' is appended to the list `lis`.
    -The character 'n' is not a digit, so the branch `else` is taken.
    -The character 'g' is appended to the list `lis`.
    -The character 'e' is not a digit, so the branch `else` is taken.
    -The character 's' is appended to the list `lis`.

The function returns the difference between the total number of fruits (21) and the sum of the number of fruits in the list `lis` (12).

Therefore, the final output of the function `fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges",21)` is 9.
