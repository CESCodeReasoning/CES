The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether n is even and greater than or equal to 8.
To determine the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 13, we need to evaluate the expression n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8.
The expression n % 2 == 0 evaluates to False because 13 is odd. Therefore, the function returns False.
