The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['1234567']).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates over the elements of `lst`, which is a list of strings.
First Iteration(lst[0] = '1234567'):
    `sum(int(d)%2==1 for d in arr)` calculates the number of odd digits in the string '1234567'.
    The expression `int(d)%2==1` is a predicate that checks if the digit `d` is odd.
    The `sum` function calculates the sum of the truth values of the predicate for each digit in the string.
    The result of the sum is 4, since there are 4 odd digits in the string '1234567'.
    The string 'the number of odd elements 4 in the string 1234567 of the input.' is appended to the list `res`.
The function returns the list `res`.
