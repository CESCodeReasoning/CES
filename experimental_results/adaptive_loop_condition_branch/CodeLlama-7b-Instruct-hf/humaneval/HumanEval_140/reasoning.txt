The function `fix_spaces` takes a string `text` as input.
The function returns a new string where any sequence of 3 or more spaces is replaced with a hyphen and any sequence of 1 or more spaces is replaced with an underscore.
The function uses a while loop to iterate through the characters of the input string.
For each character, the function checks if it is a space.
If it is a space, the function checks if the previous sequence of spaces is longer than 2.
If it is, the function adds a hyphen to the new string.
If the previous sequence of spaces is longer than 0, the function adds an underscore to the new string.
The function then adds the current character to the new string.
The function repeats this process until it has iterated through the entire input string.
