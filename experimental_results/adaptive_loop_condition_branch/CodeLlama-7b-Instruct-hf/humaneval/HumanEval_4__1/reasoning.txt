The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of floats as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the list.
To calculate the mean absolute deviation, we first calculate the mean of the list by summing up all the elements and dividing by the length of the list.
Then, we calculate the absolute deviation of each element from the mean by taking the absolute value of the difference between the element and the mean.
Finally, we calculate the mean of the absolute deviations by summing up all the absolute deviations and dividing by the length of the list.
