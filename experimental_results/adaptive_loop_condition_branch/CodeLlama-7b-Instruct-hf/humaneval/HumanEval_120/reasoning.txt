The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3 ).
The condition `k == 0` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken and the method proceeds to the next line.
The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
The last `k` elements of the sorted array are returned and stored in `ans`.
The return value of `ans` is [-4, -3, 5].

Therefore, the final output of the function `maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3)` is [-4, -3, 5].
