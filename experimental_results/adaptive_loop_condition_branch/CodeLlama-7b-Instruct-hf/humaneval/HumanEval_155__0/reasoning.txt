The function `even_odd_count` is called with ( num = -345821 ).
Inside the function, two variables `even_count` and `odd_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '3' is odd, so odd_count becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '4' is even, so even_count becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '5' is odd, so odd_count becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '8' is even, so even_count becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '2' is even, so even_count becomes 3.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '1' is odd, so odd_count becomes 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_count(-345821)` is (3, 3).
