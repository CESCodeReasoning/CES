The function string_to_md5 takes a string text as input and returns its MD5 hash.
To determine the output of executing the function string_to_md5 on the input '', we need to calculate the MD5 hash of the empty string.
The MD5 hash of the empty string is None, so the output of executing the function string_to_md5 on the input '' is None.
