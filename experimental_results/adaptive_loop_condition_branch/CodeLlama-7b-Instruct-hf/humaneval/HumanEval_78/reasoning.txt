The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "AB" ).
Inside the function, a variable `primes` is defined as a tuple of strings.
The loop iterates from 0 to the length of `num` (which is 2).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `num[i]` is 'A', which is not in `primes`.
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
   - Action: `total` remains 0.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `num[i]` is 'B', which is not in `primes`.
   - The same condition is false.
   - Action: `total` remains 0.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `total`, which is 0.
Therefore, the final output of the function `hex_key("AB")` is 0.
