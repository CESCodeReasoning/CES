The function sort_numbers takes a string of numbers separated by spaces as input and returns a sorted string of the same numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_numbers on the input "three five nine", we need to sort the numbers in the input string.
The input string is "three five nine", which is split into a list of individual numbers using the space character as the delimiter.
The list of numbers is then sorted using the value_map dictionary to map each number to its corresponding integer value.
The sorted list of numbers is then joined back into a string using the space character as the delimiter.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_numbers on the input "three five nine" is "five nine three".
