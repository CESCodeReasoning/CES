The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 3, b = 7 ).
Inside the function, a variable `a` is initialized to 3.
Inside the while loop, a variable `b` is initialized to 7.
First Iteration:
    - b = 7, a % b = 1
    - a, b = b, a % b = 7, 1
Second Iteration:
    - b = 1, a % b = 0
    - a, b = b, a % b = 1, 0
The while loop terminates because b is 0. The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 1.
