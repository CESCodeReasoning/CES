The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list `l`, which is 1.

Iteration 1:
    -The element 2 is compared with the current maximum `m`, which is 1.
    -Since 2 is greater than 1, `m` is updated to 2.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 3 is compared with the current maximum `m`, which is 2.
    -Since 3 is greater than 2, `m` is updated to 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `max_element([1, 2, 3])` is 3.
