The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "(" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is a left bracket, so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character ')' is a right bracket, so depth becomes 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `correct_bracketing("(")` is True.
