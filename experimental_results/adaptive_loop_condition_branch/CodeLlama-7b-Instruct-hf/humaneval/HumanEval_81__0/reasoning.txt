The function `numerical_letter_grade` is called with ( grades = [1.2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `letter_grade` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The value of `gpa` is 1.2, which is less than 0.7, so the `else` block is executed.
    -The `else` block's action: `letter_grade.append("E")` appends "E" to `letter_grade`.
    -The value of `letter_grade` is now ["E"].
Return Statement
    -After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `letter_grade`, which is now ["E"].

Therefore, the final output of the function `numerical_letter_grade([1.2])` is ["E"].
