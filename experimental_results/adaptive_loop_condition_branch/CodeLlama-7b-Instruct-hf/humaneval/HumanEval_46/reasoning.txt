The function `fib4` is called with ( n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `results` is initialized to [0, 0, 2, 0].
The loop iterates from 4 through 5 (since ( n = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 4):
    `results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4])` updates `results` to [0, 0, 2, 0, 6].
Second Iteration (i = 5):
    `results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4])` updates `results` to [0, 0, 2, 0, 6, 10].
After the loop completes, the condition ( n < 4 ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken and the function returns `results[-1]` which is 10.
