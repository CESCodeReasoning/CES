The function sort_array takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted array.
The function uses the sorted() function to sort the array.
The function also uses a conditional expression to determine the order of the elements in the sorted array.
If the sum of the first and last elements in the array is even, the function sorts the array in descending order.
If the sum of the first and last elements in the array is odd, the function sorts the array in ascending order.
