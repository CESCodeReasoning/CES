The function `is_happy` is called with ( s = "xyy" ).
Inside the function, a conditional statement checks if the length of the input string (s) is less than 3.
If the length is less than 3, the function returns False.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of s is 3, so the conditional statement is not executed.

Iteration 2:
    -The range of the loop is (len(s) - 2) = 0, so the loop is not executed.

Iteration 3:
    -The length of s is 3, so the conditional statement is not executed.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_happy("xyy")` is True.
