The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string that represents the sequence of numbers from 0 to n, separated by a space.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 0, we need to create a list of numbers from 0 to 0, which is an empty list.
Then, we need to convert each number in the list to a string and join them together with a space.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 0 is an empty string.
