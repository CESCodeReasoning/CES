The function get_positive takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the positive integers from the original list.
To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], we need to iterate over the list and append only the positive integers to a new list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] is [5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1].
