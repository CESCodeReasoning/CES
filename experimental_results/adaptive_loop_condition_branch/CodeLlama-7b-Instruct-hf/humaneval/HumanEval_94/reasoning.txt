The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] ).
Inside the function, two functions `isPrime` and `result` are defined.
The function `isPrime` takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by any of those numbers. If it is not divisible by any of them, then it is prime.
The function `result` takes a list `lst` as input and iterates through it.
For each element `x` in `lst`, it checks if `x` is greater than the current maximum `maxx` and if it is prime. If it is both greater than `maxx` and prime, then it updates `maxx` to `x`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the sum of the digits of the prime number `maxx`.
