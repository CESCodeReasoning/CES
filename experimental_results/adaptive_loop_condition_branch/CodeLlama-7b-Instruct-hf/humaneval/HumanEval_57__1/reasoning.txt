The function `monotonic` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 4, 20] ).
The list `l` is sorted in ascending order ( [1, 2, 4, 20] ), therefore the condition `l == sorted(l)` is true.
The condition `l == sorted(l, reverse=True)` is false, since the list is sorted in ascending order.
Therefore, the if branch is taken and the method returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])` is True.
