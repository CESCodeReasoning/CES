The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [3, 2, 3, 100, 3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of the list is 3, so running_max becomes 3.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element of the list is 2, so running_max becomes 3 (since 3 is greater than 2).
Iteration 3:
    -The third element of the list is 3, so running_max becomes 3 (since 3 is greater than 3).
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth element of the list is 100, so running_max becomes 100 (since 100 is greater than 3).
Iteration 5:
    -The fifth element of the list is 3, so running_max becomes 100 (since 100 is greater than 3).

Therefore, the final output of the function `rolling_max([3, 2, 3, 100, 3])` is [3, 3, 3, 100, 100].
