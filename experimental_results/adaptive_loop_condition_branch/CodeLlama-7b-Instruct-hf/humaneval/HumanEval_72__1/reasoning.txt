The function `will_it_fly` is called with ( q = [1, 2, 3], w = 6 ).
Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to 0 and a variable `j` is initialized to the length of `q` minus 1.
The loop iterates from 0 through the length of `q` minus 1 (since ( j = len(q) - 1 )).
First Iteration (i = 0, j = 2):
    - sum(q) > w when sum(q) = 6 > w = 6
    - The condition `sum(q) > w` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `q[i] != q[j]` is true. The second branch is taken.
    - The function returns False.
Second Iteration (i = 1, j = 1):
    - sum(q) > w when sum(q) = 6 > w = 6
    - The condition `sum(q) > w` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `q[i] != q[j]` is true. The second branch is taken.
    - The function returns False.
Third Iteration (i = 2, j = 0):
    - sum(q) > w when sum(q) = 6 > w = 6
    - The condition `sum(q) > w` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `q[i] != q[j]` is true. The second branch is taken.
    - The function returns False.
After the loop completes, the function returns False.
