The function get_row takes a list of lists lst and an integer x as input. It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row and column indices of the element in lst that is equal to x.
To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]] and 2, we need to find the row and column indices of the element in lst that is equal to x. Since the only element in lst is 1, the only tuple in the output list is (0, 0), which corresponds to the row and column indices of the element in lst that is equal to x.
Therefore, the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]] and 2 is [(0, 0)].
