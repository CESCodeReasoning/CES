The function `any_int` is called with ( x = 2, y = 3, z = 1 ).
`x`, `y`, and `z` are all integers, which satisfies (isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int)).
The condition (x+y==z) or (x+z==y) or (y+z==x) is True, since (2+3==1) is True.
Therefore, the final output of the function `any_int(2, 3, 1)` is True.
