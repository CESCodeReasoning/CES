The function `words_string` is called with ( s = "Hi, my name is John" ).
Inside the function, a variable `s_list` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'H' is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character 'H' is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'i' is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character 'i' is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ',' is equal to ',', so the if branch is taken.
    -A space is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character ' ' (space) is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 'm' is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character 'm' is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character 'y' is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character 'y' is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character ' ' (space) is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 8:
    -The character 'n' is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character 'n' is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 9:
    -The character 'a' is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character 'a' is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 10:
    -The character 'm' is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character 'm' is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 11:
    -The character 'e' is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character 'e' is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 12:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character ' ' (space) is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 13:
    -The character 'i' is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character 'i' is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 14:
    -The character 's' is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character 's' is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 15:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character ' ' (space) is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 16:
    -The character 'J' is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character 'J' is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 17:
    -The character 'o' is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character 'o' is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 18:
    -The character 'h' is not equal to ',', so the else branch is taken.
    -The character 'h' is appended to `s_list`.

After all iterations, the `s_list` is converted to a string and split into a list of words.
The final output of the function `words_string("Hi, my name is John")` is `['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']`.
