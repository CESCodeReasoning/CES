The function words_in_sentence(sentence) takes a string as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each word in the sentence.
In the inner loop, for each word indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other word that comes after it in the sentence.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - word=This: compare with is, a, test:
        - When j = 1 (word=is), the condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (word=a), the condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (word=test), the condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (word=is), the condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (word=a), the condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - word=is: compare with a, test, is:
        - When j = 2 (word=a), the condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (word=test), the condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (word=is), the condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (word=a), the condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
    - word=a: compare with test, is:
        - When j = 3 (word=test), the condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (word=is), the condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (word=a), the condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
    - word=test: compare with is:
        - When j = 4 (word=is), the condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (word=a), the condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - word=is: compare with a:
        - When j = 5 (word=a), the condition `len(word) == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.
