The function incr_list takes a list l as input and returns a new list where each element is the original element incremented by 1.
To determine the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [], we need to iterate over the elements of the list and increment each element by 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [] is [].
