<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def sort_array(array):
    return [] if len(array) == 0 else sorted(
        array, reverse=(array[0] + array[-1]) % 2 == 0)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6])
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[REASONING]
The function sort_array takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted array.
The sorting is done in a way that the first and last elements of the array are in the same position as they were in the original array.
To achieve this, the function uses the sorted() function to sort the array, but with a custom comparison function that reverses the sorting if the sum of the first and last elements is even.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6] is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[/OUTPUT]</s>
