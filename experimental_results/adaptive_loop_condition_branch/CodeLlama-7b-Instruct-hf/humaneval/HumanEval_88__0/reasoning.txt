The function sort_array takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted array.
The sorting is done in a way that the first and last elements of the array are in the same position as they were in the original array.
To achieve this, the function uses the sorted() function to sort the array, but with a custom comparison function that reverses the sorting if the sum of the first and last elements is even.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6] is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
