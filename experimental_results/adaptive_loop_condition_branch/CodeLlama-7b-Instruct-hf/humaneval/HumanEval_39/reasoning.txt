The function `prime_fib` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, the following imports are made:
    - `import math`
    - `from typing import *`

The function `is_prime` is defined inside `prime_fib`.
The function `is_prime` takes a single argument `p` of type `int`.
The function `is_prime` returns `True` if the following conditions are met:
    - `p` is greater than or equal to 2.
    - `p` is not divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `p`.

The function `prime_fib` also defines a list `f` with the initial values `[0, 1]`.
The function `prime_fib` enters a loop that appends the sum of the last two elements of `f` to `f`.
The loop continues until the condition `n == 0` is met.

The function `is_prime` is called with the last element of `f` as its argument.
If the result of `is_prime` is `True`, the function `prime_fib` subtracts 1 from `n`.
If the result of `is_prime` is `False`, the function `prime_fib` does not change `n`.

After the loop completes, the function `prime_fib` returns the last element of `f`.
