The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [4, 3, 2, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of the list is 4, so running_max becomes 4.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element of the list is 3, so running_max becomes 4 (since 4 is greater than 3).
Iteration 3:
    -The third element of the list is 2, so running_max becomes 4 (since 4 is greater than 2).
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth element of the list is 1, so running_max becomes 4 (since 4 is greater than 1).

Therefore, the final output of the function `rolling_max([4, 3, 2, 1])` is [4, 4, 4, 4].
