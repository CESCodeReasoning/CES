The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is less than 10, so the `else` block is executed.
    -The `else` block's action: `odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)` and `number_as_string = str(num)` are executed.
    -The condition `int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits` is evaluated.
    -The condition `int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits` is evaluated.
    -The condition `int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits` is `True` and `int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits` is `True`, so the `if` block is executed.
    -The `if` block's action: `count += 1` is executed, so `count` becomes 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `specialFilter([1])` is 1.
