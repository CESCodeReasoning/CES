The function `can_arrange` is called with ( arr = [4,8,5,7,3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( len(arr) = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    - i < len(arr) when i=1 and len(arr)=5
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `ind` is not updated.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - i < len(arr) when i=2 and len(arr)=5
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `ind` is not updated.
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - i < len(arr) when i=3 and len(arr)=5
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true. The if branch is taken.
    - `ind` is updated to 3.
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    - i < len(arr) when i=4 and len(arr)=5
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `ind` is not updated.
Fifth Iteration (i = 5):
    - i < len(arr) when i=5 and len(arr)=5
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The else branch is taken.
    - `ind` is not updated.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is now 3.
