The function is_bored takes a string S as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string contains two consecutive words starting with "I".
To determine the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "Hello world", we need to split the string into sentences using the regular expression r'[.?!]\s*'.
The resulting list of sentences is ["Hello world"].
Since the first two words of the only sentence in the list are not "I ", the function returns False.
