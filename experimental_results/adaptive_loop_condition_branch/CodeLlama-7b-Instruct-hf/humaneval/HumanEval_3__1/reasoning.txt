The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, -1, 2, -2, 5, -5, 4, -4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The operation is 1, so balance becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The operation is -1, so balance becomes 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The operation is 2, so balance becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The operation is -2, so balance becomes 0.
Iteration 5:
    -The operation is 5, so balance becomes 5.
Iteration 6:
    -The operation is -5, so balance becomes -5.
Iteration 7:
    -The operation is 4, so balance becomes 1.
Iteration 8:
    -The operation is -4, so balance becomes -9.

Since balance becomes -9 in the 8th iteration, the function returns True.
