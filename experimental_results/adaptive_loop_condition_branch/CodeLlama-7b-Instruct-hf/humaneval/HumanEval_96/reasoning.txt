The function count_up_to(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through the range of numbers from 2 to n-1.
In the inner loop, for each number indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other number that comes after it in the range.
First Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=2: compare with 3, 4, 5:
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=5), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=3, Compare with 4, 5:
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=5), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - numbers[i]=4, Compare with 5:
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=5), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, j in the inner loop is empty.
    - numbers[i]=5, Compare with empty:
        - No more elements to compare.
