The function `valid_date` takes a string `date` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the date is valid or not.
The function first strips any whitespace characters from the input date string using the `strip()` method.
Then, it splits the date string into three parts using the `-` character as a delimiter.
The resulting parts are assigned to the variables `month`, `day`, and `year`.

Next, the function checks the validity of the date by checking the following conditions:

1. If the month is less than 1 or greater than 12, the date is invalid.
2. If the month is one of the months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), and the day is less than 1 or greater than 31, the date is invalid.
3. If the month is one of the months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11), and the day is less than 1 or greater than 30, the date is invalid.
4. If the month is February and the day is less than 1 or greater than 29, the date is invalid.

If any of the above conditions are not met, the function returns False.
Otherwise, the function returns True.

In this case, the input date string is '04-2003', which is a valid date.
The function splits the date string into '04', '2003', and assigns them to the variables `month`, `day`, and `year`.
The function then checks the validity of the date and returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('04-2003')` is True.
