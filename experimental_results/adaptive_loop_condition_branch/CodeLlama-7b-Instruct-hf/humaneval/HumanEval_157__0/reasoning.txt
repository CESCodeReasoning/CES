The function right_angle_triangle takes three integers a, b, and c as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the triangle with sides of length a, b, and c is a right angle triangle.
To determine whether a triangle is a right angle triangle, we need to check whether the sum of the squares of its sides is equal to the square of the length of the third side.
Therefore, the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input (7, 24, 25) is True, since 7 * 7 + 24 * 24 + 25 * 25 = 25 * 25.
