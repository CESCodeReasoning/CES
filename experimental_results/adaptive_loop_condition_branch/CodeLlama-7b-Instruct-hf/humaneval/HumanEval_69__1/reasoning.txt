The function `search` is called with ( lst = [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] ).
Inside the function, a variable `frq` is initialized to a list of zeros with the same length as the maximum value in `lst` plus 1.

Iteration 1:
    -The value 8 is added to the frequency of 8 in `frq`.
Iteration 2:
    -The value 8 is added to the frequency of 8 in `frq`.
Iteration 3:
    -The value 8 is added to the frequency of 8 in `frq`.
Iteration 4:
    -The value 8 is added to the frequency of 8 in `frq`.
Iteration 5:
    -The value 8 is added to the frequency of 8 in `frq`.
Iteration 6:
    -The value 8 is added to the frequency of 8 in `frq`.
Iteration 7:
    -The value 8 is added to the frequency of 8 in `frq`.
Iteration 8:
    -The value 8 is added to the frequency of 8 in `frq`.

After all iterations, the `frq` list is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8].

The function then iterates over the range of the length of `frq` (from 1 to 8).

Iteration 1:
    -The value 1 is less than or equal to the frequency of 8 in `frq`, so the condition is true.
    -The `ans` variable is set to 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The value 2 is less than or equal to the frequency of 8 in `frq`, so the condition is true.
    -The `ans` variable is set to 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The value 3 is less than or equal to the frequency of 8 in `frq`, so the condition is true.
    -The `ans` variable is set to 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The value 4 is less than or equal to the frequency of 8 in `frq`, so the condition is true.
    -The `ans` variable is set to 4.
Iteration 5:
    -The value 5 is less than or equal to the frequency of 8 in `frq`, so the condition is true.
    -The `ans` variable is set to 5.
Iteration 6:
    -The value 6 is less than or equal to the frequency of 8 in `frq`, so the condition is true.
    -The `ans` variable is set to 6.
Iteration 7:
    -The value 7 is less than or equal to the frequency of 8 in `frq`, so the condition is true.
    -The `ans` variable is set to 7.
Iteration 8:
    -The value 8 is less than or equal to the frequency of 8 in `frq`, so the condition is true.
    -The `ans` variable is set to 8.

Therefore, the final output of the function `search([8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8])` is 8.
