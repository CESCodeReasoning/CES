The function parse_music takes a string representing a piece of music and returns a list of integers representing the duration of each note.
The function works by first splitting the input string into a list of individual notes using the space character as a delimiter.
Then, it uses a dictionary to map each note to its corresponding duration. The dictionary maps 'o' to 4, 'o|' to 2, and '.|' to 1.
Finally, the function uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing the duration of each note.
