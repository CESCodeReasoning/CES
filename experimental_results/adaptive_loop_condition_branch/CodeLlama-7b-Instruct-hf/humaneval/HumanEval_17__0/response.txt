<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    note_map = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}
    return [note_map[x] for x in music_string.split(' ') if x]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
parse_music('o| .| o| .| o o| o o|')
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[REASONING]
The function parse_music takes a string representing a piece of music and returns a list of integers representing the duration of each note.
The function works by first splitting the input string into a list of individual notes using the space character as a delimiter.
Then, it uses a dictionary to map each note to its corresponding duration. The dictionary maps 'o' to 4, 'o|' to 2, and '.|' to 1.
Finally, the function uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing the duration of each note.
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 4]
[/OUTPUT]</s>
