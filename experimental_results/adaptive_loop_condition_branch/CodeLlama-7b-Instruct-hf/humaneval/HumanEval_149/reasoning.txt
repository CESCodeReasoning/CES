The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["aa", "a", "aaa"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of `lst` is "a", which is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element of `lst` is "aa", which is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The third element of `lst` is "aaa", which is appended to `new_lst`.

The `new_lst` is then sorted based on the length of each element.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sorted_list_sum(["aa", "a", "aaa"])` is ["a", "aa", "aaa"].
