The function `is_palindrome` is called with the argument `string = 'x'`.
Inside the function, the condition `not string` is evaluated.
The condition is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken and the function continues to the next line.
The variable `beginning_of_suffix` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates until the condition `not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:])` is satisfied.
First Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 0):
    - `string[beginning_of_suffix:]` is 'x'
    - `is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:])` is not a palindrome, therefore the loop continues.
Second Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 1):
    - `string[beginning_of_suffix:]` is 'x'
    - `is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:])` is not a palindrome, therefore the loop continues.
Third Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 2):
    - `string[beginning_of_suffix:]` is 'x'
    - `is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:])` is not a palindrome, therefore the loop continues.
Fourth Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 3):
    - `string[beginning_of_suffix:]` is 'x'
    - `is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:])` is not a palindrome, therefore the loop continues.
Fifth Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 4):
    - `string[beginning_of_suffix:]` is 'x'
    - `is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:])` is not a palindrome, therefore the loop continues.
After the loop completes, the condition `not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:])` is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns the concatenation of `string` and `string[:beginning_of_suffix][::-1]`.
