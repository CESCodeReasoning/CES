The function sort_numbers takes a string of numbers separated by spaces as input and returns a sorted string of numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_numbers on the input "five zero four seven nine eight", we need to follow these steps:

1. Split the input string into a list of individual numbers using the space character as the delimiter.
2. Create a dictionary called value_map that maps each number to its corresponding value.
3. Sort the list of numbers using the value_map as the key function.
4. Join the sorted list of numbers into a single string using the space character as the delimiter.

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_numbers on the input "five zero four seven nine eight" is "eight five four seven nine zero".
