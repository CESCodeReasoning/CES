The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [1, -1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` is initialized to 0.
A variable `s` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the list `nums`.
First Iteration:
   - `num` is 1, so `s` becomes 1.
   - The condition `s < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - `max_sum` is updated to 1.
Second Iteration:
   - `num` is -1, so `s` becomes -1.
   - The condition `s < 0` is true, so the branch is taken.
   - `s` becomes 0.
   - `max_sum` is updated to 1.
The loop completes, and `max_sum` is returned.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([1, -1])` is -1.
