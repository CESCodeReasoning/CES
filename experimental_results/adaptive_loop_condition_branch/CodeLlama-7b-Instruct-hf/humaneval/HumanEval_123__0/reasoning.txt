The function `get_odd_collatz` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_collatz` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates while ( n > 1 ).
First Iteration (n = 1):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=1
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `odd_collatz` is initialized to an empty list.
Second Iteration (n = 1):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=1
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `n` is divided by 2, which is 0.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (n = 0):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=0
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is not taken.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `odd_collatz`, which is now [].
