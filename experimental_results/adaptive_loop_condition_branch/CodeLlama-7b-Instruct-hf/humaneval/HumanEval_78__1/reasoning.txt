The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "123456789ABCDEF0" ).
Inside the function, a variable `primes` is defined as a tuple of strings.
The loop iterates from 0 to the length of `num` (which is 16).

Iteration 1:
    -The character '1' is not in the tuple `primes`, so the condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
    -The branch `taken` is not taken.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '2' is in the tuple `primes`, so the condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
    -The branch `taken` is taken.
    -The variable `total` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '3' is not in the tuple `primes`, so the condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
    -The branch `taken` is not taken.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '4' is not in the tuple `primes`, so the condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
    -The branch `taken` is not taken.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '5' is not in the tuple `primes`, so the condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
    -The branch `taken` is not taken.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '6' is not in the tuple `primes`, so the condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
    -The branch `taken` is not taken.
Iteration 7:
    -The character '7' is not in the tuple `primes`, so the condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
    -The branch `taken` is not taken.
Iteration 8:
    -The character '8' is not in the tuple `primes`, so the condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
    -The branch `taken` is not taken.
Iteration 9:
    -The character '9' is not in the tuple `primes`, so the condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
    -The branch `taken` is not taken.
Iteration 10:
    -The character 'A' is in the tuple `primes`, so the condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
    -The branch `taken` is taken.
    -The variable `total` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 11:
    -The character 'B' is in the tuple `primes`, so the condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
    -The branch `taken` is taken.
    -The variable `total` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 12:
    -The character 'C' is not in the tuple `primes`, so the condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
    -The branch `taken` is not taken.
Iteration 13:
    -The character 'D' is in the tuple `primes`, so the condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
    -The branch `taken` is taken.
    -The variable `total` is incremented by 1.
Iteration 14:
    -The character 'E' is not in the tuple `primes`, so the condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
    -The branch `taken` is not taken.
Iteration 15:
    -The character 'F' is not in the tuple `primes`, so the condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
    -The branch `taken` is not taken.
Iteration 16:
    -The character '0' is not in the tuple `primes`, so the condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
    -The branch `taken` is not taken.

Therefore, the final output of the function `hex_key("123456789ABCDEF0")` is 4.
