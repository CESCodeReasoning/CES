The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['(()(())', '())())'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `val` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The string '(()(())' is passed to the function `check`.
    -The function `check` iterates through the string '(()(())'.
    -The first character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
    -The second character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 2.
    -The third character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 3.
    -The fourth character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 4.
    -The fifth character '(' is encountered, so val becomes 5.
    -The sixth character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 4.
    -The seventh character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 3.
    -The eighth character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 2.
    -The ninth character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 1.
    -The tenth character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 0.
    -The function `check` returns True.
Iteration 2:
    -The string '())())' is passed to the function `check`.
    -The function `check` iterates through the string '())())'.
    -The first character ')' is encountered, so val becomes -1.
    -The second character ')' is encountered, so val becomes -2.
    -The third character ')' is encountered, so val becomes -3.
    -The fourth character ')' is encountered, so val becomes -4.
    -The fifth character ')' is encountered, so val becomes -5.
    -The sixth character '(' is encountered, so val becomes -4.
    -The seventh character '(' is encountered, so val becomes -3.
    -The eighth character '(' is encountered, so val becomes -2.
    -The ninth character '(' is encountered, so val becomes -1.
    -The tenth character ')' is encountered, so val becomes 0.
    -The function `check` returns False.
