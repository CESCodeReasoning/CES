The function `tri` is called with ( n = 8 ).
Inside the function, a variable `my_tri` is initialized to [1, 3].

Iteration 1:
    -The condition `n == 0` is false, so the first branch is not taken.
    -The variable `my_tri` is updated to [1, 3, 1].
Iteration 2:
    -The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true, so the second branch is taken.
    -The variable `my_tri` is updated to [1, 3, 1, 4].
Iteration 3:
    -The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false, so the first branch is taken.
    -The variable `my_tri` is updated to [1, 3, 1, 4, 7].
Iteration 4:
    -The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true, so the second branch is taken.
    -The variable `my_tri` is updated to [1, 3, 1, 4, 7, 11].
Iteration 5:
    -The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false, so the first branch is taken.
    -The variable `my_tri` is updated to [1, 3, 1, 4, 7, 11, 16].
Iteration 6:
    -The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true, so the second branch is taken.
    -The variable `my_tri` is updated to [1, 3, 1, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22].
Iteration 7:
    -The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false, so the first branch is taken.
    -The variable `my_tri` is updated to [1, 3, 1, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29].
Iteration 8:
    -The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true, so the second branch is taken.
    -The variable `my_tri` is updated to [1, 3, 1, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37].
Iteration 9:
    -The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false, so the first branch is taken.
    -The variable `my_tri` is updated to [1, 3, 1, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46].
Iteration 10:
    -The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true, so the second branch is taken.
    -The variable `my_tri` is updated to [1, 3, 1, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46, 55].

Finally, the function returns the value of `my_tri`, which is [1, 3, 1, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46, 55].

Therefore, the final output of the function `tri(8)` is [1, 3, 1, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46, 55].
