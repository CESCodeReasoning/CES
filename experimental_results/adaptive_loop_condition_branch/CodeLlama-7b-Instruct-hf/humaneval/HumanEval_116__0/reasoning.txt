The function sort_array takes an array of integers arr as input and returns a sorted array of integers.
The sorting is done based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each integer.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [3,6,44,12,32,5], we need to sort the array first based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each integer.
The sorted array is then returned.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [3,6,44,12,32,5] is [5,3,12,32,6,44].
