The function `digits` is called with ( n = 120 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1.
A variable `odd_count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the digits of the input number (n = 120).
First Iteration (digit = 1):
   - `digit` is 1, which is an odd number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product = product * int_digit` results in `product = 1 * 1 = 1`.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 1.
Second Iteration (digit = 2):
   - `digit` is 2, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `product = product * int_digit` results in `product = 1 * 2 = 2`.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 2.
Third Iteration (digit = 0):
   - `digit` is 0, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `product = product * int_digit` results in `product = 2 * 0 = 0`.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 2.
Fourth Iteration (digit = 1):
   - `digit` is 1, which is an odd number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product = product * int_digit` results in `product = 0 * 1 = 0`.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 3.
Fifth Iteration (digit = 2):
   - `digit` is 2, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `product = product * int_digit` results in `product = 0 * 2 = 0`.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 3.
Sixth Iteration (digit = 0):
   - `digit` is 0, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `product = product * int_digit` results in `product = 0 * 0 = 0`.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 3.
Seventh Iteration (digit = 1):
   - `digit` is 1, which is an odd number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product = product * int_digit` results in `product = 0 * 1 = 0`.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 4.
Eighth Iteration (digit = 2):
   - `digit` is 2, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `product = product * int_digit` results in `product = 0 * 2 = 0`.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 4.
Ninth Iteration (digit = 0):
   - `digit` is 0, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `product = product * int_digit` results in `product = 0 * 0 = 0`.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 4.
Tenth Iteration (digit = 1):
   - `digit` is 1, which is an odd number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product = product * int_digit` results in `product = 0 * 1 = 0`.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 5.
Eleventh Iteration (digit = 2):
   - `digit` is 2, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `product = product * int_digit` results in `product = 0 * 2 = 0`.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 5.
Twelfth Iteration (digit = 0):
   - `digit` is 0, which is an even number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `product = product * int_digit` results in `product = 0 * 0 = 0`.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 5.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digits(120)` is 0.
