The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -3, 1, 2, -3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The operation is 1, so balance becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The operation is 2, so balance becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The operation is -3, so balance becomes -2.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is true, so the branch is taken and the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `below_zero([1, 2, -3, 1, 2, -3])` is `True`.
