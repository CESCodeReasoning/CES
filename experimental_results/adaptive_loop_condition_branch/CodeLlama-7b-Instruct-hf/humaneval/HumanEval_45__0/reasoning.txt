The function triangle_area takes two arguments a and h, which represent the base and height of a triangle, respectively. The function returns the area of the triangle, which is calculated by multiplying the base and height and then dividing the result by 2.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (10, 8), we need to calculate the area of the triangle. The area of a triangle is calculated by multiplying the base and height and then dividing the result by 2. In this case, the base is 10 and the height is 8, so the area of the triangle is (10 * 8) / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20.
Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (10, 8) is 20.
