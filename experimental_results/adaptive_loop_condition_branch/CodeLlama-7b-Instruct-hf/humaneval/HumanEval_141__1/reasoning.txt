The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = '@this1_is6_valid.exe' ).
The variable `suf` is a list of file extensions ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'].
The variable `lst` is a list of the file name split by the '.' character.
The length of `lst` is 2, therefore the if branch is not taken.

The first element of `lst` is '@this1_is6_valid', which is not empty and starts with a letter.
The number of digits in the first element of `lst` is 3, which is less than 4.
Therefore, the method returns 'Yes'.
