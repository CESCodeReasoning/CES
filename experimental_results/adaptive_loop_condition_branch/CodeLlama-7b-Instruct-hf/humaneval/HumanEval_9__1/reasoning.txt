The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of the list is 1, so running_max becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element of the list is 2, so running_max becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The third element of the list is 3, so running_max becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth element of the list is 4, so running_max becomes 4.

The function returns the list [1, 2, 3, 4].
