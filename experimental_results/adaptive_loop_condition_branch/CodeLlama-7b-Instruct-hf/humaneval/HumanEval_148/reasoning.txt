The function `bf` is called with ( planet1 = "Jupiter", planet2 = "Neptune" ).
`planet1` and `planet2` are both in the list `planet_names`, and `planet1` is not equal to `planet2`.
The condition `planet1 not in planet_names` and `planet2 not in planet_names` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition `planet1 == planet2` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
The method returns the tuple ().

Therefore, the final output of the function `bf("Jupiter", "Neptune")` is ().
