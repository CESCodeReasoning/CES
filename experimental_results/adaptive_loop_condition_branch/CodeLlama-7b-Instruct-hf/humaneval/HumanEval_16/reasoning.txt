The function count_distinct_characters takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function on the input 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE', we need to count the number of distinct characters in the concatenated string.
There are 5 distinct characters in the concatenated string: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function on the input 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' is 5.
