<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
3. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
4. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
5. Enclose the annotated code with [PYTHON] AND [/PYTHON]
6. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

Bellow are some examples:

[/QUESTION]

[REASONING]
The function `sum_of_integer` is called with ( N = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `sum` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( N = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 3 ( 1 + 2 = 3 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 6 ( 3 + 3 = 6 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 10 ( 6 + 4 = 10 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 15 ( 10 + 5 = 1 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `sum`, which is now 15.

The function `reverse_string` is called with (input_string = 'hello' ).
Inside the function, a variable `reversed_string` is initialized to ''.
`len(input_string)` = 5 since there are 5 characters in 'hello'.
The loop iterates from 0 to 4 since `range(len(input_string))`= [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

The function `sum_squares` is called with (lst = [-2.4, 1, 1]).
Inside the function, a variable `squared` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the elements of the list `lst`.
First Iteration(i = -2.4):
    `math.ceil(i)` = -2
    `math.ceil(i)**2` = 4
    `squared` = 4 + 0 = 4
Second Iteration(i = 1):

    `math.ceil(i)**2` = 1
    `squared` = 4 + 1 = 5
Third Iteration(i = 1):
    `math.ceil(i)` = 1
    `math.ceil(i)**2` = 1
    `squared` = 5 + 1 = 6
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `squared`, which is now 6.

[REASONING]
The function `is_even` is called with (n = 4).
Inside the function, a conditional statement is used to check if `n` is even.
If `n` is even, then `n % 2 == 0` is true, so the function returns `True`.
If `n` is not even, then `n % 2 != 0` is true, so the function returns `False`.

[/QUESTION]

[REASONING]
The function `is_prime` is called with (n = 7).
Inside the function, a conditional statement is used to check if `n` is prime.
If `n` is less than or equal to 1, then `n <= 1` is true, so the function returns `False`.
If `n` is greater than 1, then `n > 1` is true, so the function continues to the next step.
The loop iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (since `n` is prime if it is divisible only by 1 and itself).
First Iteration(i = 2):
    `n % i` = 7 % 2 = 1
    `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues to the next iteration.
Second Iteration(i = 3):
    `n % i` = 7 % 3 = 1
    `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues to the next iteration.
Third Iteration(i = 4):
    `n % i` = 7 % 4 = 3
    `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues to the next iteration.
Fourth Iteration(i = 5):
    `n % i` = 7 % 5 = 2
    `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues to the next iteration.
Fifth Iteration(i = 6):
    `n % i` = 7 % 6 = 1
    `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues to the next iteration.
After the loop completes, the function returns `True` since `n` is prime.

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]):
[/QUESTION]

[REASONING]
The function `is_palindrome` is called with (s = 'racecar').
Inside the function, a variable `s` is assigned the value of `s.lower()`.
The loop iterates from 0 to the length of `s` divided by 2 (since `s` is a string and `len(s)` is the length of the string).
First Iteration(i = 0):
    `s[i]` = 'r'
    `s[-i-1]` = 'r'
    `s[i] != s[-i-1]` is false, so the loop continues to the next iteration.
Second Iteration(i = 1):
    `s[i]` = 'a'
    `s[-i-1]` = 'a'
    `s[i] != s[-i-1]` is false, so the loop continues to the next iteration.
