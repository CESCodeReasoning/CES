The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 144, b = 60).
Inside the function, a variable `a` is initialized to 144.
Inside the while loop, a variable `b` is initialized to 60.
First Iteration:
    - b = 60, a % b = 44.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 44 and b to 20.
Second Iteration:
    - b = 20, a % b = 14.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 14 and b to 14.
Third Iteration:
    - b = 14, a % b = 0.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 14 and b to 0.
The while loop terminates because b is 0. The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 14.
