The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest and smallest non-zero integers in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [-1, -3, -5, -6], we need to filter out the negative integers from the list and then find the largest and smallest non-zero integers in the filtered list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [-1, -3, -5, -6] is (-1, -6).
