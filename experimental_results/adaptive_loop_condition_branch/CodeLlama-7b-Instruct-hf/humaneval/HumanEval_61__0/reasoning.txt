The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = ")((" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character ')' is not a '(' so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is a '(' so depth becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ')' is not a '(' so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '(' is a '(' so depth becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ')' is not a '(' so depth becomes 1.

Since depth is not equal to 0, the function returns False.
