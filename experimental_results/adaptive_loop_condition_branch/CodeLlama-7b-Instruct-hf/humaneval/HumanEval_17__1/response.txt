<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    note_map = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}
    return [note_map[x] for x in music_string.split(' ') if x]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
parse_music('.| .| .| .|')
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[REASONING]
The function parse_music takes a string music_string as input and returns a list of integers.
The function works by first splitting the input string into a list of substrings using the space character as the delimiter.
Then, it iterates over the list of substrings and for each substring, it checks if it is in the note_map dictionary.
If the substring is in the dictionary, it returns the corresponding integer value.
Otherwise, it returns 0.
The function then returns the list of integer values.
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[/OUTPUT]
