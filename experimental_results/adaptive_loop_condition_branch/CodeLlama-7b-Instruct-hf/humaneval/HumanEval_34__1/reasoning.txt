The function unique takes a list l as input and returns a sorted list of unique elements in l.
To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1], we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to remove all duplicates from the input list l. We can do this by converting the list to a set, which automatically removes duplicates.
2. Next, we need to sort the resulting list.
3. Finally, we need to convert the sorted list back to a list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1] is [1, 2].
