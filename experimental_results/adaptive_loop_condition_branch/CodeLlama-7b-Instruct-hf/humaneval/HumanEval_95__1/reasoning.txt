The function `check_dict_case` is called with ( dict = {"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"} ).
Inside the function, a variable `state` is initialized to "start".

Iteration 1:
    -The key "Name" is a string, so the condition `isinstance(key, str) == False` is false.
    -The condition `state == "start"` is true, so the state is updated to "upper".
    -The condition `key.isupper()` is true, so the state is updated to "upper".
Iteration 2:
    -The key "Age" is a string, so the condition `isinstance(key, str) == False` is false.
    -The condition `state == "start"` is false, so the state is not updated.
    -The condition `key.isupper()` is false, so the state is not updated.
Iteration 3:
    -The key "City" is a string, so the condition `isinstance(key, str) == False` is false.
    -The condition `state == "start"` is false, so the state is not updated.
    -The condition `key.isupper()` is false, so the state is not updated.

Therefore, the final output of the function `check_dict_case({"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"})` is "upper".
