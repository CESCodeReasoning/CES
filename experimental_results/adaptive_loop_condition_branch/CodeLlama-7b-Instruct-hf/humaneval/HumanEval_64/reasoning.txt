The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "abcde" ).
The variable `vowels` is initialized to "aeiouAEIOU".
The variable `n_vowels` is initialized to the sum of the number of vowels in `s` (using a generator expression).
The condition `s[-1] == 'y' or s[-1] == 'Y'` is evaluated.
If `s[-1] == 'y'` or `s[-1] == 'Y'`, then the if branch is taken and `n_vowels` is incremented by 1.
Otherwise, the else branch is taken and `n_vowels` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("abcde")` is 3.
