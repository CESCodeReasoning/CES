The function triangle_area takes two arguments a and h, which represent the base and height of a triangle, respectively. The function returns the area of the triangle, which is calculated by multiplying the base and height and then dividing the result by 2.0.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (5, 3), we need to calculate the area of the triangle with base 5 and height 3. The area of the triangle is 5 * 3 / 2.0 = 7.5. Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (5, 3) is 7.5.
