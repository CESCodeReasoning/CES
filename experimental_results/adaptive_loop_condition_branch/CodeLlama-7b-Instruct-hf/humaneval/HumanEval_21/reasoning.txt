The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a list of floating-point numbers that have been rescaled to have a range of 0 to 1.
To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9], we need to follow the steps below:

1. Find the minimum and maximum values in the input list: min_number = 2.0, max_number = 49.9
2. Calculate the rescaled values for each input number: (x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number) for x in numbers

The rescaled values are:

* 2.0 - 2.0 = 0.0
* 49.9 - 2.0 = 47.9

Therefore, the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9] is [0.0, 0.98].
