The function `fibfib` is called with ( n = 2 ).
The first if branch is evaluated, since ( n = 2 ) is not equal to 0.
The second if branch is evaluated, since ( n = 2 ) is not equal to 1.
The third if branch is evaluated, since ( n = 2 ) is equal to 2.
The method returns 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fibfib(2)` is 1.
