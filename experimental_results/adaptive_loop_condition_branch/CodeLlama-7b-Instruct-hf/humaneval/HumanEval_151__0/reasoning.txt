The function double_the_difference takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the squares of all the positive integers in the list that are not divisible by 2 and do not contain a decimal point.
To determine the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [-10, -20, -30], we need to follow the steps below:

1. The list [-10, -20, -30] is passed as an argument to the function.
2. The list is iterated over and the following conditions are checked for each element:
	* The element is positive (i > 0).
	* The element is not divisible by 2 (i % 2 != 0).
	* The element does not contain a decimal point ("." not in str(i)).
3. If all the conditions are true, the square of the element is calculated and added to the sum.
4. The sum of the squares of all the positive integers in the list that are not divisible by 2 and do not contain a decimal point is returned as the output.

Therefore, the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [-10, -20, -30] is 0.
