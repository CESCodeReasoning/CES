The function `pairs_sum_to_zero(l)` takes a list of integers `l` as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by `i` in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
