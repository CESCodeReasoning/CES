The function `strange_sort_list` is called with ( lst = [111111]).
Inside the function, two variables `res` and `switch` are initialized to empty lists and `True`, respectively.
First Iteration:
    - lst = [111111], min(lst) = 111111, max(lst) = 111111.
    -`res.append(min(lst))` appends 111111 to `res`.
    -`lst.remove(res[-1])` removes 111111 from `lst`.
    -`switch` is not changed.
Second Iteration:
    - lst = [], min(lst) = 111111, max(lst) = 111111.
    -`res.append(min(lst))` appends 111111 to `res`.
    -`lst.remove(res[-1])` raises a `ValueError` because `lst` is empty.
    -`switch` is not changed.
The while loop terminates because `lst` is empty. The function returns `res`, which is now [111111].
