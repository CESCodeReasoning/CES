The function reverse_delete takes two arguments: s and c.
s is a string and c is a string of characters that should be removed from s.
The function returns a tuple containing two elements: the modified string s and a boolean value indicating whether the string s is a palindrome or not.

To determine the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcdedcba" and "v", we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to remove all occurrences of the character 'v' from the input string "abcdedcba".
2. Then, we need to check if the resulting string is a palindrome or not.
3. If the resulting string is a palindrome, we return a tuple containing the modified string and a boolean value of True.
4. If the resulting string is not a palindrome, we return a tuple containing the modified string and a boolean value of False.

Therefore, the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcdedcba" and "v" is ("abcde", False).
