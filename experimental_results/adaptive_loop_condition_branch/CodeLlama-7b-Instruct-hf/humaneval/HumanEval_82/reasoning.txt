The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Hello' ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the length of the input string.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of the input string is 5, so l becomes 5.
Iteration 2:
    -The length of the input string is 5, so l becomes 5.
Iteration 3:
    -The length of the input string is 5, so l becomes 5.
Iteration 4:
    -The length of the input string is 5, so l becomes 5.
Iteration 5:
    -The length of the input string is 5, so l becomes 5.

The function returns `True` because the length of the input string is prime (i.e., it is only divisible by 1 and itself).
