The function common(l1, l2) takes two lists as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the first list.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by e1 in the outer loop, compare it with every element in the second list.
First Iteration (e1=1):
    - `e1` is 1, `e2` in the inner loop is 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121.
    - `l1` is [1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], `l2` is [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121].
    - When `e2` is 5 (numbers[j]=5), the condition `e1 == e2` is True, the if branch is taken. Add 1 to the set `ret`.
