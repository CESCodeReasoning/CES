The function `is_multiply_prime` takes an integer `a` as its parameter.
The function first defines a function `is_prime` that takes an integer `n` as its parameter.
The function `is_prime` checks if `n` is prime by iterating from 2 to `n - 1` and checking if `n` is divisible by any number between 2 and `n - 1`. If `n` is not divisible by any number between 2 and `n - 1`, then `n` is prime.
The function `is_multiply_prime` then defines another function `is_prime` that takes an integer `n` as its parameter.
The function `is_multiply_prime` then iterates from 2 to 100 and checks if each number is prime. If a number is prime, then the function checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and 100. If the number is divisible by any number between 2 and 100, then the number is not prime.
