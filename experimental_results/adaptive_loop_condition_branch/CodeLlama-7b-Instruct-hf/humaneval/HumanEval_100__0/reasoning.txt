The function make_a_pile takes an integer n as input and returns a list of length n, where each element is the sum of the input n and twice the index of the element.
To determine the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 4, we need to create a list of length 4, where each element is the sum of 4 and twice the index of the element.
Therefore, the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 4 is [6, 8, 10, 12].
