The function incr_list takes a list l as input and returns a new list where each element is the original element plus 1.
To determine the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [3, 2, 1], we need to iterate over the list and add 1 to each element.
Therefore, the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [3, 2, 1] is [4, 3, 2].
