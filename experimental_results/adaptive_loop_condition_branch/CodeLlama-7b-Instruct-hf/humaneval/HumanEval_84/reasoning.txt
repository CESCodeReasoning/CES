The function solve takes an integer N as input and returns the binary representation of the sum of the digits of N.
To determine the output of executing the function solve on the input 1000, we need to calculate the sum of the digits of 1000, which is 1+0+0+0=1.
Then, we need to convert the sum to binary, which is 1 in binary.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solve on the input 1000 is "1".
