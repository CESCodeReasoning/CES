The function `count_upper` is called with ( s = 'dBBE' ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 to 2 (since ( len(s) = 4 ) and ( step = 2 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is less than 2.
   - The condition `i < 2` is true.
   - Action: `count += 1` results in `count = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which is less than 2.
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `count += 1` updates `count` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Third Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which is greater than 2.
   - The condition `i < 2` is false.
   - Action: the loop terminates.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `count`, which is now 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `count_upper('dBBE')` is 2.
