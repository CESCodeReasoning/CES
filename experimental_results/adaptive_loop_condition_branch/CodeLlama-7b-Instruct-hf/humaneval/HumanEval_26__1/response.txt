<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    import collections
    c = collections.Counter(numbers)
    return [n for n in numbers if c[n] <= 1]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
remove_duplicates([])
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[REASONING]
The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains the same integers as the input list, but with all duplicates removed.
To achieve this, the function first imports the collections module and creates a counter object c that counts the frequency of each integer in the input list.
Then, the function creates a new list that contains only the integers that appear in the input list at most once.
To do this, the function uses a list comprehension that iterates over the input list and adds each integer to the new list only if its frequency in the counter object c is less than or equal to 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [] is also [].
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
[]
[/OUTPUT]</s>
