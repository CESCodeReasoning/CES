The function remove_duplicates takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains the same integers as the input list, but with all duplicates removed.
To achieve this, the function first imports the collections module and creates a counter object c that counts the frequency of each integer in the input list.
Then, the function creates a new list that contains only the integers that appear in the input list at most once.
To do this, the function uses a list comprehension that iterates over the input list and adds each integer to the new list only if its frequency in the counter object c is less than or equal to 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_duplicates on the input [] is also [].
