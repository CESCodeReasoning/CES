<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def double_the_difference(lst):
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i%2!=0 and "." not in str(i)])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
double_the_difference([0.2, 3, 5]) 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[REASONING]
The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of all the positive even numbers in the list that are not integers.
To determine the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [0.2, 3, 5], we need to follow the steps below:

1. The list [0.2, 3, 5] is passed as an argument to the function.
2. The function iterates over the list and checks each element.
3. For the first element 0.2, it is not a positive even number, so it is skipped.
4. For the second element 3, it is a positive even number, so it is included in the sum.
5. For the third element 5, it is a positive even number, so it is included in the sum.
6. The sum of the squares of the positive even numbers in the list is 3^2 + 5^2 = 18 + 25 = 43.
7. The output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [0.2, 3, 5] is 43.
[REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
43
[/OUTPUT]</s>
