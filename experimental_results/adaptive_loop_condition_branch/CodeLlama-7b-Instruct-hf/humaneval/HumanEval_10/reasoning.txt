The function `is_palindrome` is called with the argument `string='jerry'`.
The function first checks if the input string is empty.
Since the input string is not empty, the function proceeds to the next step.
The function initializes a variable `beginning_of_suffix` to 0.
The function then enters a loop that continues until the condition `not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:])` is satisfied.
The condition is satisfied when the input string is a palindrome, which is not the case for the input string `'jerry'`.
Therefore, the loop continues to iterate until the input string is a palindrome.
Inside the loop, the function appends the input string to itself, but with the first `beginning_of_suffix` characters reversed.
For example, for the input string `'jerry'`, the function appends `'jerry'` to itself, but with the first 0 characters reversed, which results in the string `'jerry'`.
The function then returns the resulting string.
