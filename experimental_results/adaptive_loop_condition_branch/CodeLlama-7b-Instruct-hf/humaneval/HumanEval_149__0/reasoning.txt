The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["d", "dcba", "abcd", "a"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element in the list is "a", which is an odd-length string.
    -The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
    -The element "a" is appended to the new list `new_lst`.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element in the list is "dcba", which is an even-length string.
    -The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true, so the branch is taken.
    -The element "dcba" is appended to the new list `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The third element in the list is "abcd", which is an even-length string.
    -The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true, so the branch is taken.
    -The element "abcd" is appended to the new list `new_lst`.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth element in the list is "d", which is an odd-length string.
    -The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
    -The element "d" is appended to the new list `new_lst`.

The new list `new_lst` is sorted using the `key` parameter `len`.
The sorted list is returned.
