The function get_positive takes a list l as input and returns a new list containing only the positive elements of l.
To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6], we need to iterate over the list and add only the positive elements to the new list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6] is [4, 5, 6].
