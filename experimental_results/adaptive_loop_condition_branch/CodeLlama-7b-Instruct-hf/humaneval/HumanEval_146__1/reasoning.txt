The function `specialFilter` is called with an empty list `nums`.
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the empty list `nums`.
Since the list is empty, the loop does not execute any iterations.
The function returns the value of `count`, which is 0.
Therefore, the final output of the function `specialFilter([])` is 0.
