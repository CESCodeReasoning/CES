The function parse_music takes a string music_string as input and returns a list of integers.
The function works by first splitting the input string on spaces using the split() method.
The resulting list of strings is then iterated over and each string is looked up in a dictionary note_map.
If the string is found in the dictionary, its corresponding value is added to the output list.
If the string is not found in the dictionary, the output list is not modified.
The function returns the output list.
