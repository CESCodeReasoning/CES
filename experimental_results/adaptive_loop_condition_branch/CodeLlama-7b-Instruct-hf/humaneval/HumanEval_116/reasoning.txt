The function sort_array takes an array of integers arr as input and returns a sorted array of integers.
The sorting is done based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each integer.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4], we need to sort the array [1,5,2,3,4] based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each integer.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4] is [1,2,3,4,5].
