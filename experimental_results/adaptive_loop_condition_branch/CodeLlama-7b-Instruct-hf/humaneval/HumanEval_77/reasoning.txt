The function iscube takes a number a as input and returns a boolean indicating whether a is a cube.
To determine whether a is a cube, we need to check whether a has a cube root that is an integer.
We can do this by taking the absolute value of a, raising it to the power of 1/3, rounding the result to the nearest integer, and then checking whether the result is equal to a.
Therefore, the output of executing the function iscube on the input 1 is True, since 1 has a cube root of 1.
