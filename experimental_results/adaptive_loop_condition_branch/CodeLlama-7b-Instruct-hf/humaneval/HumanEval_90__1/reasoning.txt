The function next_smallest takes a list of integers lst as input and returns the next smallest element in the list.
If the list is empty, the function returns None.
Otherwise, the function sorts the list and returns the second element in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [], we need to sort the empty list and return the second element, which is None.
Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [] is None.
