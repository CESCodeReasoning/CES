The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a new list with the elements of l sorted in ascending order.
The sorting is done based on the third element of each sublist.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], we need to sort the list based on the third element.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] is [5, 3, -3, 2, -5, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10].
