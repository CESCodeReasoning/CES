The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a new list where each element is the original element rescaled to have a value between 0 and 1.

To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0], we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the minimum and maximum values in the input list. In this case, the minimum value is 1.0 and the maximum value is 5.0.
2. Subtract the minimum value from each element in the input list to get a new list where each element is the original element minus the minimum value. In this case, the new list is [1.0, 0.0, 4.0, 2.0, 3.0].
3. Divide each element in the new list by the difference between the maximum and minimum values to rescale the values to have a range of 0 to 1. In this case, the rescaled list is [0.2, 0.0, 0.8, 0.4, 0.6].

Therefore, the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0] is [0.2, 0.0, 0.8, 0.4, 0.6].
