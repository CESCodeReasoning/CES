<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
3. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
4. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
5. Enclose the annotated code with [PYTHON] AND [/PYTHON]
6. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

    return duplicates
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
find_all_duplicate([3, 5, 4, 3, 7, 4])
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function find_all_duplicate(numbers) takes a list of numbers([3, 5, 4, 3, 7, 4]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterats through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=3: compare with 5, 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 1 (numbers[j]=5), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 3 to duplicates.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken. 
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=5: compare with 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=4: compare with 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 4 to duplicates
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=3, Compare with 7, 4:
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - numbers[i] = 7, compare with 4:
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.

First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]):
[/QUESTION]
[/INST]

[ANSWER]
[REASONING]
The function count_up_to(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the range(2, n) to check if it is a prime number.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the range(2, i).
First Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=2: compare with 3, 4, 5:
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=5), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=3: compare with 4, 5:
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=5), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - numbers[i]=4, Compare with 5:
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=5), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - numbers[i]=5, Compare with 5:
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=5), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken.
