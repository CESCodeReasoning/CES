The function `starts_one_ends` is called with ( n = 4 ).
`n` is 4, which does not satisfy ( n == 1 ).
The condition `n == 1` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken and the method returns 18 * (10 ** (4 - 2)) = 18 * (10 ** 2) = 1800

Therefore, the final output of the function `starts_one_ends(4)` is 1800.
