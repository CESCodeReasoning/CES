The function `sum_product` is called with (numbers = []).
Inside the function, a variable `sum_value` is initialized to 0.
A variable `prod_value` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates through the empty list `numbers`.
Since the list is empty, the loop body is not executed.
The function returns a tuple containing the values of `sum_value` and `prod_value`, which are both 0.
