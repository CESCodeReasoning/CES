The function `is_happy` is called with ( s = "xyy" ).
Inside the function, the length of the string `s` is checked.

Iteration 1:
    -The first character 'x' is not equal to the second character 'y', so the condition is false.
Iteration 2:
    -The second character 'y' is not equal to the third character 'y', so the condition is false.
Iteration 3:
    -The first character 'x' is not equal to the third character 'y', so the condition is false.

Since none of the conditions are true, the function returns `True`.
