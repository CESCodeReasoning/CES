The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = '0' ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the length of the string, which is 1.
The condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is false, since `l` is not equal to 0 or 1.
The loop iterates from 2 to 1 (since `l` is 1).
The condition `l % i == 0` is false, since `l` is not divisible by any number between 2 and 1.
The function returns True.
