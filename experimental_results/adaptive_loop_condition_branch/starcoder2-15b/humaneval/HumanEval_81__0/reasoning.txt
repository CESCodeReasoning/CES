The function `numerical_letter_grade` is called with ( grades = [1.2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `letter_grade` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The value of `gpa` is 1.2.
    -The condition `gpa == 4.0` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 3.7` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 3.3` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 3.0` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 2.7` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 2.3` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 2.0` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 1.7` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 1.3` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 1.0` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 0.7` is false.
    -The condition `gpa > 0.0` is true.
    -The `else` block is executed, and the letter grade "E" is appended to the `letter_grade` list.

The function returns the `letter_grade` list, which contains the letter grade "E".
