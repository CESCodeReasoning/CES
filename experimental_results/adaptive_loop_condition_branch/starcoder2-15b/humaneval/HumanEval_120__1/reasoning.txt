The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [123, -123, 20, 0, 1, 2, -3], k = 3 ).
`k` is 3, which is not equal to 0.
The condition `k == 0` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
The last `k` elements of the sorted array are selected and returned as the answer.

Therefore, the final output of the function `maximum([123, -123, 20, 0, 1, 2, -3], 3)` is [-3, 0, 1].
