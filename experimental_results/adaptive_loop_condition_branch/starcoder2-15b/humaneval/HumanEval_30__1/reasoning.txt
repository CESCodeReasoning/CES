The function get_positive takes a list l as input and returns a new list containing only the positive elements of l.
To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2], we need to iterate over the elements of [-1, -2] and check if they are positive.
Since both -1 and -2 are negative, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2] is an empty list [].
