The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers that have been rescaled to be between 0 and 1.
To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], we need to perform the following steps:
1. Find the minimum and maximum numbers in the input list. In this case, the minimum number is 1.0 and the maximum number is 5.0.
2. For each number in the input list, subtract the minimum number (1.0) and divide the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum numbers (5.0 - 1.0 = 4.0).
3. Return the list of rescaled numbers.
Therefore, the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] is [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0].
