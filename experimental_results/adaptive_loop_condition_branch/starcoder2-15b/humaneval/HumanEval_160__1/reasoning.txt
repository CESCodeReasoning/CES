The function `do_algebra` is called with (operator = ['+', '*', '-'], operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]).
Inside the function, a variable `expression` is initialized to '2'.
`zip(operator, operand[1:])` returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an operator and an operand.
The loop iterates through the tuples in `zip(operator, operand[1:])`.

First Iteration (oprt = '+', oprn = 3):
    expression += oprt + str(oprn) results in expression = '2+3'
Second Iteration (oprt = '*', oprn = 4):
    expression += oprt + str(oprn) results in expression = '2+3*4'
Third Iteration (oprt = '-', oprn = 5):
    expression += oprt + str(oprn) results in expression = '2+3*4-5'
After the loop completes, the function returns the result of evaluating the expression using `eval(expression)`.
