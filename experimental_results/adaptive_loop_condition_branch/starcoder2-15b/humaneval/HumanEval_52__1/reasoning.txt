The function `below_threshold` is called with ( l = [1, 20, 4, 10], t = 5 ).
Inside the function, the loop iterates through each element in the list l.

Iteration 1:
    -The element '1' is less than the threshold '5', so the condition `e >= t` is false.
Iteration 2:
    -The element '20' is greater than or equal to the threshold '5', so the condition `e >= t` is true.
    -The function returns False, since the condition is true for at least one element.
