The function iscube takes an integer a as input and returns True if a is a cube number, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function iscube on the input 1, we need to check if 1 is a cube number.
We first take the absolute value of 1, which is 1.
Then, we calculate the cube root of 1, which is 1.
Finally, we check if the cube of 1 is equal to 1, which is True.
Therefore, the output of executing the function iscube on the input 1 is True.
