The function triangle_area takes two arguments, a and h, and returns the area of a triangle with base a and height h.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area with arguments 2 and 2, we need to calculate the area of a triangle with base 2 and height 2.
The area of a triangle with base a and height h is given by the formula a * h / 2.0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area with arguments 2 and 2 is 2.0.
