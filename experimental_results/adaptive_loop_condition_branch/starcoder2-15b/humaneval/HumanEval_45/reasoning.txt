The function triangle_area takes two arguments, a and h, and returns the area of a triangle with base a and height h.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area with arguments 5 and 3, we need to calculate the area of a triangle with base 5 and height 3.
The area of a triangle is given by the formula: area = base * height / 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area with arguments 5 and 3 is 7.5.
