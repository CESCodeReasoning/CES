The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -4, 5, 6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The value of `op` is 1.
    -The value of `balance` is updated to 1.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is false.
Iteration 2:
    -The value of `op` is 2.
    -The value of `balance` is updated to 3.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is false.
Iteration 3:
    -The value of `op` is -4.
    -The value of `balance` is updated to -1.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is true.
