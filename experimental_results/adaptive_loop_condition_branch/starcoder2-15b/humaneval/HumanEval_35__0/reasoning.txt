The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [-5, 2, 48, 9, 4, 0, 6, 7] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list `l`, which is -5.

Iteration 1:
    -The element 2 is greater than -5, so m becomes 2.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 48 is greater than 2, so m becomes 48.
Iteration 3:
    -The element 9 is less than 48, so m remains 48.
Iteration 4:
    -The element 4 is less than 48, so m remains 48.
Iteration 5:
    -The element 0 is less than 48, so m remains 48.
Iteration 6:
    -The element 6 is less than 48, so m remains 48.
Iteration 7:
    -The element 7 is less than 48, so m remains 48.

The function returns the maximum element in the list, which is 48.
