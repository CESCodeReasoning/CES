The function `below_threshold` is called with ( l = [1, 8, 4, 10], t = 11 ).
Inside the function, the loop iterates through each element in the list l.

Iteration 1:
    -The element '1' is less than the threshold '11', so the condition `e >= t` is false.
Iteration 2:
    -The element '8' is greater than or equal to the threshold '11', so the condition `e >= t` is true.
    -The function returns False.
