The function `x_or_y` is called with ( n = 91, x = 56, y = 129 ).
Inside the function, the condition `n == 1` is evaluated.
Since `n` is not equal to 1, the condition is false.
The loop iterates from 2 to 90 (since `n` is 91).
Iteration 1:
    - `i` is 2, and `n` is not divisible by 2 (91 % 2 = 1).
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 2:
    - `i` is 3, and `n` is not divisible by 3 (91 % 3 = 1).
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 3:
    - `i` is 4, and `n` is not divisible by 4 (91 % 4 = 3).
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 4:
    - `i` is 5, and `n` is not divisible by 5 (91 % 5 = 1).
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 5:
    - `i` is 6, and `n` is not divisible by 6 (91 % 6 = 1).
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
    - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 6:
    - `i` is 7, and `n` is not divisible by 7 (91 % 7 = 0).
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is true.
    - The loop breaks and the `else` block is skipped.
    - The function returns the value of `y`, which is 129.
