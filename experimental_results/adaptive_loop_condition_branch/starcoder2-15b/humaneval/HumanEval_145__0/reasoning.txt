The function `order_by_points` is called with ( nums = [1234,423,463,145,2,423,423,53,6,37,3457,3,56,0,46] ).
Inside the function, a function `digits_sum` is defined.
The function `digits_sum` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the digits of `n`.
The function `digits_sum` first checks if `n` is negative. If it is, it multiplies `n` by -1 and sets the variable `neg` to -1.
The function then converts `n` to a string and splits it into individual digits using the `str` function.
The function then converts each digit back to an integer using the `int` function.
The function then multiplies the first digit by `neg` and returns the sum of all the digits.
The function `order_by_points` then uses the `sorted` function to sort the list `nums` based on the sum of the digits of each number.
The `sorted` function takes the list `nums` as input and a key function `digits_sum` to determine the order of the elements in the list.
The `sorted` function returns a new list with the elements sorted based on the sum of the digits of each number.

Therefore, the final output of the function `order_by_points([1234,423,463,145,2,423,423,53,6,37,3457,3,56,0,46])` is [0, 2, 3, 6, 53, 37, 56, 145, 423, 423, 423, 463, 1234, 3457, 46].
