The function `string_xor` is called with ( a = '0101', b = '0000' ).
Inside the function, the `xor` function is defined.
The `xor` function takes two arguments, `i` and `j`.
If `i` and `j` are equal, the function returns '0'.
Otherwise, it returns '1'.
The `string_xor` function returns a string formed by concatenating the result of calling the `xor` function on each pair of characters from `a` and `b`.

In this case, the `string_xor` function is called with ( a = '0101', b = '0000' ).
The `xor` function is called on each pair of characters from `a` and `b`.
The first pair is ('0', '0'), which results in '0' because both characters are equal.
The second pair is ('1', '0'), which results in '1' because the characters are different.
The third pair is ('0', '0'), which results in '0' because both characters are equal.
The fourth pair is ('1', '0'), which results in '1' because the characters are different.
The `string_xor` function returns the string formed by concatenating the results of the `xor` function on each pair of characters, which is '0101'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `string_xor('0101', '0000')` is '0101'.
