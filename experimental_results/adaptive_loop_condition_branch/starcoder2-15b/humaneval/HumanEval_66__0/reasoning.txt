The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "abcCd" ).
`s` is not an empty string, therefore the condition `s == ""` is false.
The function returns the sum of the ASCII values of the uppercase characters in the string `s`.
The ASCII value of 'C' is 67, and the ASCII value of 'D' is 68.
Therefore, the final output of the function `digitSum("abcCd")` is 135.
