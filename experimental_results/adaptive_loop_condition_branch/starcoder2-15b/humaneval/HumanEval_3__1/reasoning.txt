The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, -1, 2, -2, 5, -5, 4, -4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The value of `op` is 1.
    -The value of `balance` is 0 + 1 = 1.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is False.
    -The function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 2:
    -The value of `op` is -1.
    -The value of `balance` is 1 + (-1) = 0.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is False.
    -The function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 3:
    -The value of `op` is 2.
    -The value of `balance` is 0 + 2 = 2.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is False.
    -The function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 4:
    -The value of `op` is -2.
    -The value of `balance` is 2 + (-2) = 0.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is False.
    -The function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 5:
    -The value of `op` is 5.
    -The value of `balance` is 0 + 5 = 5.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is False.
    -The function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 6:
    -The value of `op` is -5.
    -The value of `balance` is 5 + (-5) = 0.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is False.
    -The function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 7:
    -The value of `op` is 4.
    -The value of `balance` is 0 + 4 = 4.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is False.
    -The function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 8:
    -The value of `op` is -4.
    -The value of `balance` is 4 + (-4) = 0.
    -The condition `balance < 0` is False.
    -The function continues to the next iteration.

After the loop completes, the function returns False.
