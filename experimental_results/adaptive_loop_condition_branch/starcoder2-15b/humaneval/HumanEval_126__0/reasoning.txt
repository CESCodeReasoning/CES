The function `is_sorted` is called with ( lst = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count_digit` is initialized to a dictionary with keys as the elements of `lst` and values as 0.
The loop iterates through each element in `lst`.
First Iteration (i = 1):
    `count_digit[i]` is 0, `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit[i]` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    `count_digit[i]` is 0, `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit[i]` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    `count_digit[i]` is 0, `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit[i]` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
    `count_digit[i]` is 0, `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit[i]` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst) ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition ( all(lst[i - 1] <= lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst))) ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `True` as the output.
