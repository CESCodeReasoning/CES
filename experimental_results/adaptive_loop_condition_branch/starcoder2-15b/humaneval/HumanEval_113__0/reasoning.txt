The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['3',"11111111"]).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates over each element in the list lst.

First Iteration (arr = '3'):
    The sum of the odd digits in '3' is 3.
    The string "the number of odd elements 3n the str3ng 3 of the nput." is appended to the list res.
Second Iteration (arr = "11111111"):
    The sum of the odd digits in "11111111" is 0.
    The string "the number of odd elements 0n the str0ng 0 of the nput." is appended to the list res.
After the loop completes, the function returns the list res, which contains two strings:
"the number of odd elements 3n the str3ng 3 of the nput." and "the number of odd elements 0n the str0ng 0 of the nput."
