The function `bf` is called with ( planet1 = "Earth", planet2 = "Earth" ).
`planet1` is "Earth", which is in the list of planet_names.
`planet2` is also "Earth", which is also in the list of planet_names.
The condition `planet1 not in planet_names or planet2 not in planet_names or planet1 == planet2` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns an empty tuple.

Therefore, the final output of the function `bf("Earth", "Earth")` is ().
