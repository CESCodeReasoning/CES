The function filter_by_prefix takes a list of strings and a prefix as input and returns a list of strings that start with the given prefix.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_prefix on the input ['abc', 'abcd', 'abcde'] and 'abc', we need to check if each string in the list starts with the prefix 'abc'.
The strings 'abc' and 'abcde' start with the prefix 'abc', so they are included in the output list. The string 'abcd' does not start with the prefix 'abc', so it is not included in the output list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function filter_by_prefix on the input ['abc', 'abcd', 'abcde'] and 'abc' is ['abc', 'abcde'].
