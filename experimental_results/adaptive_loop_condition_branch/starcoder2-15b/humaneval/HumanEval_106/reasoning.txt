The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through the range from 1 to n + 1.
For each element i in the range, if i is even, calculate the factorial of i and append it to ret.
Otherwise, calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to i and append it to ret.
First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, which is odd.
    - Calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to 1, which is 1.
    - Append 1 to ret.
Second Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, which is even.
    - Calculate the factorial of 2, which is 2.
    - Append 2 to ret.
Third Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, which is odd.
    - Calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to 3, which is 6.
    - Append 6 to ret.
Fourth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, which is even.
    - Calculate the factorial of 4, which is 24.
    - Append 24 to ret.
Fifth Iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, which is odd.
    - Calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to 5, which is 15.
    - Append 15 to ret.
