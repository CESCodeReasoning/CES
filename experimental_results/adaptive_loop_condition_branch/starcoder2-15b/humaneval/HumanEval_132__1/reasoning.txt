The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = "[[[[]]]]" ).
Inside the function, a variable `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` are initialized to empty lists.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '[' is found at index 0, so opening_bracket_index becomes [0].
Iteration 2:
    -The character '[' is found at index 1, so opening_bracket_index becomes [0, 1].
Iteration 3:
    -The character '[' is found at index 2, so opening_bracket_index becomes [0, 1, 2].
Iteration 4:
    -The character '[' is found at index 3, so opening_bracket_index becomes [0, 1, 2, 3].
Iteration 5:
    -The character ']' is found at index 4, so closing_bracket_index becomes [4].
Iteration 6:
    -The character ']' is found at index 5, so closing_bracket_index becomes [4, 5].
Iteration 7:
    -The character ']' is found at index 6, so closing_bracket_index becomes [4, 5, 6].
Iteration 8:
    -The character ']' is found at index 7, so closing_bracket_index becomes [4, 5, 6, 7].
Iteration 9:
    -The character ']' is found at index 8, so closing_bracket_index becomes [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
Iteration 10:
    -The character ']' is found at index 9, so closing_bracket_index becomes [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

The closing_bracket_index list is reversed to [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4].

Iteration 1:
    -The first opening_bracket_index is 0, which is less than the first closing_bracket_index 9.
    -cnt becomes 1.
    -i becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second opening_bracket_index is 1, which is less than the second closing_bracket_index 8.
    -cnt becomes 2.
    -i becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The third opening_bracket_index is 2, which is less than the third closing_bracket_index 7.
    -cnt becomes 3.
    -i becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth opening_bracket_index is 3, which is less than the fourth closing_bracket_index 6.
    -cnt becomes 4.
    -i becomes 4.

Since cnt is greater than or equal to 2, the function returns True.
