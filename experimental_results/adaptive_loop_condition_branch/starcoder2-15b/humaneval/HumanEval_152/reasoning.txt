The function compare takes two lists game and guess as input and returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input [1,2,3,4,5,1] and [1,2,3,4,2,-2], we need to calculate the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists.
Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input [1,2,3,4,5,1] and [1,2,3,4,2,-2] is [0,0,0,0,3,3].
