The function reverse_delete takes two arguments: a string s and a string c.
It removes all characters in s that are also in c, and then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome.

In this case, the input string s is "abcdedcba" and the input string c is "v".
The function removes all characters in s that are also in c, which means it removes all characters in s that are also in "v".
Since "v" is an empty string, the function removes all characters in s, which means it removes all characters in "abcdedcba".
The resulting string is an empty string "".

The function then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome. An empty string is a palindrome, so the function returns ("", True).
