The function `prod_signs` is called with ( arr = [-1, 1, 1, 1] ).
`arr` is not empty, so the condition `not arr` is false.
The if branch is not taken.
The function returns the value of `prod * sum([abs(i) for i in arr])`.

The variable `prod` is initialized to 0 if 0 is in `arr`, otherwise it is initialized to (-1) ** len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr))).
In this case, 0 is not in `arr`, so `prod` is initialized to (-1) ** len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr))).
The list comprehension [abs(i) for i in arr] returns a list of the absolute values of the elements in `arr`.
In this case, it returns [1, 1, 1].
The function returns the product of `prod` and the sum of the elements in the list [1, 1, 1], which is 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `prod_signs([-1, 1, 1, 1])` is 3.
