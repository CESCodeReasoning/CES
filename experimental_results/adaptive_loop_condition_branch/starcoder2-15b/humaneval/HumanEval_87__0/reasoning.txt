The function get_row takes a two-dimensional list lst and an integer x as input and returns a list of coordinates (i, j) where lst[i][j] == x.
To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[1]], 2, we need to find the coordinates of the element 2 in the list [[1]].
Since the element 2 does not exist in the list [[1]], the function returns an empty list [].
