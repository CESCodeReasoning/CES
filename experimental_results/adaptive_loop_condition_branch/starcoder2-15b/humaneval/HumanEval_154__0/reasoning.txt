The function cycpattern_check(a, b) takes two strings a and b as its parameters.
The function returns True if the pattern b is found in the string a, otherwise returns False.
The function first checks if the length of b is greater than or equal to the length of a. If it is, then the pattern cannot be found in the string, so the function returns False.
The function then creates a new string pat by concatenating b with itself.
The function then iterates through all possible starting indices i of the pattern in the string a.
For each starting index i, the function iterates through all possible starting indices j of the pattern in the concatenated string pat.
For each starting index j, the function checks if the pattern in a starting at index i is equal to the pattern in pat starting at index j. If it is, then the pattern is found in the string, so the function returns True.
If the function reaches the end of the loop without finding the pattern, then it returns False.
