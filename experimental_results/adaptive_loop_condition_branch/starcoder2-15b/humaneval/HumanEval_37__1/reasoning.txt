The function `sort_even` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `evens` is initialized to [1].
A variable `odds` is initialized to [2].
The `evens` list is sorted in-place.
The `ans` list is initialized to [].
The loop iterates over the elements of `evens` and `odds` using the `zip` function.
First Iteration (e = 1, o = 2):
    `ans.extend([e, o])` appends 1 and 2 to the `ans` list.
After the loop completes, the condition ( len(evens) > len(odds) ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The function returns the `ans` list as the output.
