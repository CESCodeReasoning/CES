The function `intersection` is called with ( interval1 = (1, 2), interval2 = (2, 3) ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the maximum of interval1[0] and interval2[0], which is 2.
A variable `r` is initialized to the minimum of interval1[1] and interval2[1], which is 2.
A variable `length` is initialized to the difference between `r` and `l`, which is 0.
The function `is_prime` is called with ( num = 0 ).
Inside the function, the condition `num == 1 or num == 0` is true.
The function returns False.
The condition `length > 0 and is_prime(length)` is false.
The function returns "NO".
