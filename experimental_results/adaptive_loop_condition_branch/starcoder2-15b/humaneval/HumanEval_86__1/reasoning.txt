The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input and returns a string that is the result of shuffling the letters in each word of s.
To determine the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input "Hello World!!!", we need to split the input string into words, sort the letters in each word, and join the sorted words with spaces.
Therefore, the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input "Hello World!!!" is "eHllloo Worldd!!".
