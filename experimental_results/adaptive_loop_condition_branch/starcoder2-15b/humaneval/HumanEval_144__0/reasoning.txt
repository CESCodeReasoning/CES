The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "2/4", n = "8/4" ).
Inside the function, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the values of the corresponding parts of the input strings.
The variables `numerator` and `denom` are calculated by multiplying the values of `a` and `c`, and `b` and `d`, respectively.
The condition `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` is evaluated.
Since `numerator` is 2 and `denom` is 4, the condition evaluates to `2 / 4 == int(2 / 4)`, which is `0.5 == int(0.5)`, which is `True`.
The `if` branch is taken and the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("2/4", "8/4")` is `True`.
