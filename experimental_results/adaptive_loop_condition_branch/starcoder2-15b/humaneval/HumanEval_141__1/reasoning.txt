The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = '@this1_is6_valid.exe' ).
Inside the function, the variable `suf` is initialized to ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'].
The variable `lst` is initialized to the result of splitting the file_name by the '.' character.
The file_name is split into two parts: '@this1_is6_valid' and 'exe'.
The first condition checks if the length of lst is not equal to 2.
Since the length of lst is 2, the condition is false, and the if branch is not taken.
The second condition checks if the second part of lst, 'exe', is not in the list suf.
Since 'exe' is in suf, the condition is false, and the if branch is not taken.
The third condition checks if the length of the first part of lst, '@this1_is6_valid', is equal to 0.
Since the length of the first part of lst is not 0, the condition is false, and the if branch is not taken.
The fourth condition checks if the first character of the first part of lst, '@', is not an alphabet.
Since the first character of the first part of lst is not an alphabet, the condition is true, and the if branch is taken.
The function returns 'No'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `file_name_check('@this1_is6_valid.exe')` is 'No'.
