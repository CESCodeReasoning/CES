The function sort_array takes an array of integers arr as input and returns a sorted array.
The sorting is done in two steps:
1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Sort the array again, but this time using a custom key function that counts the number of ones in the binary representation of each element.

To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [3,6,44,12,32,5], we need to perform the two steps of sorting described above.

Step 1: Sort the array in ascending order.
The array [3,6,44,12,32,5] is sorted in ascending order as [3,5,6,12,32,44].

Step 2: Sort the array again, but this time using a custom key function that counts the number of ones in the binary representation of each element.
The array [3,5,6,12,32,44] is sorted again using the custom key function that counts the number of ones in the binary representation of each element.
The binary representation of each element is converted to a string and the number of ones is counted.
The array is sorted in ascending order based on the number of ones in the binary representation of each element.

Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [3,6,44,12,32,5] is [3,5,6,12,32,44].
