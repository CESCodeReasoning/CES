The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1 ).
`k` is 1, which is not equal to 0.
The condition `k == 0` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
The last `k` elements of the sorted array are selected and returned as the answer.

Therefore, the final output of the function `maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1)` is [2].
