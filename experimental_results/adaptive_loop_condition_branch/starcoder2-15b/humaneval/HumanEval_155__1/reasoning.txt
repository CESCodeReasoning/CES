The function `even_odd_count` is called with ( num = -78 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_count` and `odd_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '7' is not divisible by 2, so odd_count becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '8' is divisible by 2, so even_count becomes 1.
