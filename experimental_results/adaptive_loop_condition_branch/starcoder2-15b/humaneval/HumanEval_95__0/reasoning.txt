The function `check_dict_case` is called with ( dict = {"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345" } ).
Inside the function, the condition `len(dict.keys()) == 0` is evaluated.
Since the length of the dictionary's keys is not 0, the `else` block is executed.

The variable `state` is initialized to "start".
The loop iterates over the keys of the dictionary.

First Iteration (key = "STATE")
   - The condition `isinstance(key, str) == False` is evaluated.
   - Since the key is a string, the condition is False.
   - The `if` block is not executed.
   - The condition `state == "start"` is evaluated.
   - Since `state` is "start", the condition is True.
   - The condition `key.isupper()` is evaluated.
   - Since the key is "STATE", the condition is True.
   - The `if` block is executed.
   - `state` is updated to "upper".

Second Iteration (key = "ZIP")
   - The condition `isinstance(key, str) == False` is evaluated.
   - Since the key is a string, the condition is False.
   - The `if` block is not executed.
   - The condition `state == "start"` is evaluated.
   - Since `state` is not "start", the condition is False.
   - The condition `(state == "upper" and not key.isupper()) or (state == "lower" and not key.islower())` is evaluated.
   - Since `state` is "upper" and the key is "ZIP", the condition is False.
   - The `if` block is not executed.
   - The `else` block is executed.
   - The loop breaks.

The function returns the value of `state == "upper" or state == "lower"`.
Since `state` is "upper", the function returns True.
