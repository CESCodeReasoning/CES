The function `compare_one` is called with ( a = 1, b = 2 ).
Inside the function, the variables `temp_a` and `temp_b` are initialized to the values of `a` and `b`, respectively.
The first if statement checks if `temp_a` is an instance of the `str` class. Since `temp_a` is an integer, it is not an instance of `str`, and the if statement is not executed.
The second if statement checks if `temp_b` is an instance of the `str` class. Since `temp_b` is an integer, it is not an instance of `str`, and the if statement is not executed.
The third if statement checks if the float value of `temp_a` is equal to the float value of `temp_b`. Since `temp_a` and `temp_b` are both integers, their float values are the same. The condition is true, and the function returns `None`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one(1, 2)` is `None`.
