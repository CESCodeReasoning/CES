The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a sorted version of l.
The sorted version of l is obtained by sorting every third element of l in ascending order.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], we need to sort every third element of the input list in ascending order.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] is [-5, 3, 5, 2, -3, 3, 0, 9, 123, 1, -10].
