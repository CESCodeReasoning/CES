The function triangle_area takes two arguments, a and h, and returns the area of a triangle with base a and height h.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area with arguments 10 and 8, we need to calculate the area of a triangle with base 10 and height 8.
The area of a triangle is given by the formula (base * height) / 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area with arguments 10 and 8 is 40.
