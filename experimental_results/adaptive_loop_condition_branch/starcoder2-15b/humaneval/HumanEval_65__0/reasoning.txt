The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 97, shift = 8 ).
`shift` is 8, which is greater than the length of `s` (which is 2).
The condition `shift > len(s)` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns the reversed string of `s` (which is "97").

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(97, 8)` is "97".
