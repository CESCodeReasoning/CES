The function add takes a list lst as input and returns the sum of the even numbers in lst, skipping every other number.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 4, 6, 8], we need to consider the even numbers in the list [4, 4, 6, 8], skipping every other number.
Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 4, 6, 8] is 12.
