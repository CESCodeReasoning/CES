The function find_closest_elements(numbers) takes a list of numbers([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by idx in the outer loop, compare it with every other element in the list.
First Iteration (idx=0):
    - `idx` is 0, idx2 in the inner loop is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
    - elem=1.1: compare with 1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1:
        - When idx2 = 0 (elem2=1.1), the condition `idx!= idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 1 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx!= idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - distance is None, so distance = abs(1.1 - 2.2) = 1.1, closest_pair = tuple(sorted([1.1, 2.2])) = (1.1, 2.2)
        - When idx2 = 2 (elem2=3.1), the condition `idx!= idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - distance is not None, so new_distance = abs(1.1 - 3.1) = 2.0, new_distance < distance, so distance = 2.0, closest_pair = tuple(sorted([1.1, 3.1])) = (1.1, 3.1)
        - When idx2 = 3 (elem2=4.1), the condition `idx!= idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - distance is not None, so new_distance = abs(1.1 - 4.1) = 3.0, new_distance < distance, so distance = 3.0, closest_pair = tuple(sorted([1.1, 4.1])) = (1.1, 4.1)
        - When idx2 = 4 (elem2=5.1), the condition `idx!= idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - distance is not None, so new_distance = abs(1.1 - 5.1) = 4.0, new_distance < distance, so distance = 4.0, closest_pair = tuple(sorted([1.1, 5.1])) = (1.1, 5.1)
Second Iteration (idx=1):
    - `idx` is 1, idx2 in the inner loop is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
    - elem=2.2: compare with 1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1:
        - When idx2 = 0 (elem2=1.1), the condition `idx!= idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - distance is not None, so new_distance = abs(2.2 - 1.1) = 1.1, new_distance < distance, so distance = 1.1, closest_pair = tuple(sorted([1.1, 2.2])) = (1.1, 2.2)
        - When idx2 = 1 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx!= idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 2 (elem2=3.1), the condition `idx!= idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - distance is not None, so new_distance = abs(2.2 - 3.1) = 0.9, new_distance < distance, so distance = 0.9, closest_pair = tuple(sorted([2.2, 3.1])) = (2.2, 3.1)
        - When idx2 = 3 (elem2=4.1), the condition `idx!= idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - distance is not None, so new_distance = abs(2.2 - 4.1) = 1.9, new_distance < distance, so distance = 1.9, closest_pair = tuple(sorted([2.2, 4.1])) = (2.2, 4.1)
        - When idx2 = 4 (elem2=5.1), the condition `idx!= idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - distance is not None, so new_distance = abs(2.2 - 5.1) = 2.9, new_distance < distance, so distance = 2.9, closest_pair = tuple(sorted([2.2, 5.1])) = (2.2, 5.1)
Third Iteration (idx=2):
    - `idx` is 2, idx2 in the inner loop is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
    - elem=3.1: compare with 1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1:
        - When idx2 = 0 (elem2=1.1), the condition `idx!= idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - distance is not None, so new_distance = abs(3.1 - 1.1) = 2.0, new_distance < distance, so distance = 2.0, closest_pair = tuple(sorted([1.1, 3.1])) = (1.1, 3.1)
        - When idx2 = 1 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx!= idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - distance is not None, so new_distance = abs(3.1 - 2.2) = 0.9, new_distance < distance, so distance = 0.9, closest_pair = tuple(sorted([2.2, 3.1])) = (2.2, 3.1)
        - When idx2 = 2 (elem2=3.1), the condition `idx!= idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 3 (elem2=4.1), the condition `idx!= idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - distance is not None, so new_distance = abs(3.1 - 4.1) = 1.0, new_distance < distance, so distance = 1.0, closest_pair = tuple(sorted([3.1, 4.1])) = (3.1, 4.1)
        - When idx2 = 4 (elem2=5.1), the condition `idx!= idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
