The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = "Wow" ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the length of the string, which is 3.

The first conditional statement checks if the length of the string is 0 or 1. Since the length is 3, the condition is false and the function continues to the next statement.

The second for loop iterates from 2 to 2 (since l = 3). The loop body checks if the length is divisible by the current value of i. Since 3 % 2 is not equal to 0, the condition is false and the function returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `prime_length('Wow')` is False.
