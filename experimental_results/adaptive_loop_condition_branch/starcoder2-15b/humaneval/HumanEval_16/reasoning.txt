The function count_distinct_characters takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function count_distinct_characters on the input 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE', we need to concatenate the strings 'abcde', 'cade', and 'CADE' and then count the number of distinct characters in the resulting string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function count_distinct_characters on the input 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' is 5.
