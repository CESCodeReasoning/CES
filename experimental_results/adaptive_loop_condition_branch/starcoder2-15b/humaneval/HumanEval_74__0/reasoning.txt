The function `total_match` is called with ( lst1 = ['4'], lst2 = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `l1` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the elements of lst1.
First Iteration (st = '4'):
    len(st) = 1, `l1 += len(st)` updates `l1` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
After the loop completes, `l1` is 1.

Inside the function, a variable `l2` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the elements of lst2.
First Iteration (st = '1'):
    len(st) = 1, `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (st = '2'):
    len(st) = 1, `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 2 ( 1 + 1 = 2 ).
Third Iteration (st = '3'):
    len(st) = 1, `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 3 ( 2 + 1 = 3 ).
Fourth Iteration (st = '4'):
    len(st) = 1, `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 4 ( 3 + 1 = 4 ).
Fifth Iteration (st = '5'):
    len(st) = 1, `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 5 ( 4 + 1 = 5 ).
After the loop completes, `l2` is 5.

The condition ( l1 <= l2 ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns lst1 as the output.
