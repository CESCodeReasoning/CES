The function `is_happy` is called with ( s = "aabb" ).
Inside the function, the length of the string `s` is checked.
The length of `s` is 4, which is greater than 3.
The loop iterates from 0 to 1 (since ( len(s) - 2 = 2 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - The characters at indices 0, 1, and 2 are 'a', 'a', and 'b', respectively.
   - The condition `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]` is false.
   - The function returns `False`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - The characters at indices 1, 2, and 3 are 'a', 'b', and 'b', respectively.
   - The condition `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]` is false.
   - The function returns `False`.
Since both iterations return `False`, the function returns `False`.
