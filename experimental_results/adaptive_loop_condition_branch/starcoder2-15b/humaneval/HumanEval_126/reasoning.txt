The function `is_sorted` is called with ( lst = [5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count_digit` is initialized to a dictionary with keys from the list `lst` and values set to 0.
The loop iterates through the list `lst` and increments the value of each element in the `count_digit` dictionary.
The condition `any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst)` checks if any element in the list `lst` has a count greater than 2 in the `count_digit` dictionary. Since all elements in the list `lst` have a count of 1, the condition evaluates to `False`.
The condition `all(lst[i-1] <= lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst)))` checks if the elements in the list `lst` are in ascending order. Since the list `lst` has only one element, the condition evaluates to `True`.
Since both conditions evaluate to `False` and `True`, respectively, the function returns `True` as the output.
