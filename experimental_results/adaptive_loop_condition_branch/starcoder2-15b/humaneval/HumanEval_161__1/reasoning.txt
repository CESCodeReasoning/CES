The function `solve` is called with ( s = "ab" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'a' is an alphabet, so flg becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'b' is an alphabet, so flg becomes 1.

The function returns the value of `s`, which is "AB".
