The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [5, -2, 1, -5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 5 is not greater than 10, so the condition `num > 10` is false.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 2:
    -The number -2 is not greater than 10, so the condition `num > 10` is false.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 1 is not greater than 10, so the condition `num > 10` is false.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 4:
    -The number -5 is not greater than 10, so the condition `num > 10` is false.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.

Since all the numbers in the list are less than or equal to 10, the function returns 0.
