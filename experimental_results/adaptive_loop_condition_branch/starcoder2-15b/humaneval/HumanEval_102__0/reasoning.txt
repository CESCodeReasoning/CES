The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 13, y = 12 ).
`x` is 13, which is not greater than `y` (12).
The condition `x > y` is false, therefore the first if branch is not taken.
`y` is 12, which is evenly divisible by 2.
The condition `y % 2 == 0` is true, therefore the second if branch is taken and the method returns 12.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(13, 12)` is 12.
