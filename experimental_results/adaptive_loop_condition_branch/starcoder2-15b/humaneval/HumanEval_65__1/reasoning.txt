The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 12, shift = 1 ).
`shift` is 1, which is less than the length of `s` (2).
The condition `shift > len(s)` is false, therefore the else branch is taken.
The function returns the substring of `s` from the index `len(s) - shift` to the end, concatenated with the substring from the beginning to the index `len(s) - shift`.
In this case, `s` is "12", `len(s)` is 2, and `shift` is 1.
Therefore, the substring from the index `len(s) - shift` to the end is "2", and the substring from the beginning to the index `len(s) - shift` is "1".
The function returns the concatenated string "21".

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(12, 1)` is "21".
