The function reverse_delete takes two arguments: a string s and a string c.
It removes all characters in s that are also in c, and then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome.
To determine the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input ("abcde", "ae"), we need to remove all characters in "abcde" that are also in "ae", which results in the string "bcd".
Then, we check if the resulting string "bcd" is a palindrome, which it is not.
Therefore, the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input ("abcde", "ae") is ("bcd", False).
