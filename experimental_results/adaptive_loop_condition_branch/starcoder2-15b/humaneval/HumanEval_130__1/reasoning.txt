The function `tri` is called with ( n = 8 ).
Inside the function, a variable `my_tri` is initialized to [1, 3].
The loop iterates from 2 through 8 (since ( n = 8 )).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which is even.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` appends 2 to `my_tri` (`[1, 3, 2]`).
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which is odd.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` appends 6 to `my_tri` (`[1, 3, 2, 6]`).
Third Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which is even.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` appends 3 to `my_tri` (`[1, 3, 2, 6, 3]`).
Fourth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which is odd.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` appends 11 to `my_tri` (`[1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 11]`).
Fifth Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is 6, which is even.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` appends 4 to `my_tri` (`[1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 11, 4]`).
Sixth Iteration (i = 7)
   - `i` is 7, which is odd.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` appends 17 to `my_tri` (`[1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 11, 4, 17]`).
Seventh Iteration (i = 8)
   - `i` is 8, which is even.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` appends 5 to `my_tri` (`[1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 11, 4, 17, 5]`).
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `my_tri`, which is now [1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 11, 4, 17, 5].

Therefore, the final output of the function `tri(8)` is [1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 11, 4, 17, 5].
