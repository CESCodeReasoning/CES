The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and returns True if n is even and greater than or equal to 8, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 13, we need to check if 13 is even and greater than or equal to 8.
Since 13 is odd, it is not even, and therefore the function returns False.
