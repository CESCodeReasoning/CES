The function `is_prime` is called with ( n = 11 * 7 = 77 ).
Inside the function, the condition `n < 2` is false.
The loop iterates from 2 through 76 (since ( n - 1 = 76 )).
First Iteration (k = 2)
   - `n` is 77, which is not divisible by 2 (77 % 2 = 1).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
Second Iteration (k = 3)
   - `n` is 77, which is not divisible by 3 (77 % 3 = 2).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
Third Iteration (k = 4)
   - `n` is 77, which is not divisible by 4 (77 % 4 = 3).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
Fourth Iteration (k = 5)
   - `n` is 77, which is not divisible by 5 (77 % 5 = 2).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
Fifth Iteration (k = 6)
   - `n` is 77, which is not divisible by 6 (77 % 6 = 5).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
Sixth Iteration (k = 7)
   - `n` is 77, which is not divisible by 7 (77 % 7 = 0).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is true.
   - Action: The function returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_prime(11 * 7)` is False.
