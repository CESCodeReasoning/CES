The function `can_arrange` is called with the argument `arr = [4,8,5,7,3]`.
Inside the function, a variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The loop iterates from 1 through 4 (since `len(arr) = 5`).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    - `i < len(arr)` when `i = 1` and `len(arr) = 5` is True.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is False. The first branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - `i < len(arr)` when `i = 2` and `len(arr) = 5` is True.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is False. The first branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - `i < len(arr)` when `i = 3` and `len(arr) = 5` is True.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is True. The first branch is taken.
    - `ind` is updated to 3.
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    - `i < len(arr)` when `i = 4` and `len(arr) = 5` is True.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is False. The first branch is not taken.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is now 3.
