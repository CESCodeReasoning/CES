The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '03-11-2000' ).
Inside the function, the date string is stripped of leading and trailing whitespaces.
The date string is then split into three parts using the '-' character as a delimiter.
The month, day, and year parts are converted to integers.
The month is 3, which is not less than 1 or greater than 12.
The condition `month < 1 or month > 12` is false.
The month is 3, which is not in the list [1,3,5,7,8,10,12].
The condition `month in [1,3,5,7,8,10,12]` is false.
The month is 3, which is not in the list [4,6,9,11].
The condition `month in [4,6,9,11]` is false.
The month is 3, which is not equal to 2.
The condition `month == 2` is false.
The function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('03-11-2000')` is True.
