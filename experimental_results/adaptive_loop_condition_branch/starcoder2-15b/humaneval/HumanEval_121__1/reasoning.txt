The function solution takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the even-indexed elements that are odd.
To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32], we need to consider the elements at even-indexed positions in the list.
The elements at even-indexed positions are 30 and 23.
Next, we need to check if these elements are odd.
30 is even, so it is not included in the sum.
23 is odd, so it is included in the sum.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32] is 23.
