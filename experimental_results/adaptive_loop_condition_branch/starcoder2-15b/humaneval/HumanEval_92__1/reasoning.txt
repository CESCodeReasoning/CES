The function `any_int` is called with ( x = 3, y = 4, z = 7 ).
`x`, `y`, and `z` are all integers, which satisfies (isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int)). The if branch is taken.
The condition (x + y == z) is False, (x + z == y) is True, and (y + z == x) is False.
The condition ((x + y == z) or (x + z == y) or (y + z == x)) is True, and the function returns True.
