The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'b b b b a' ).
Inside the function, a variable `dict1` is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The variable `list1` is initialized to the list of words in `test` after splitting it by spaces.
The variable `t` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The word 'b' appears 4 times in `list1`, which is greater than `t` (0).
    -The condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is true.
    -The value of `t` is updated to 4.
Iteration 2:
    -The word 'a' appears 1 time in `list1`, which is not greater than `t` (4).
    -The condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is false.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.

After the loop completes, the value of `t` is 4.
The condition `(t > 0)` is true, so the next loop is executed.

Iteration 1:
    -The word 'b' appears 4 times in `list1`, which is equal to `t` (4).
    -The condition `(list1.count(i) == t)` is true.
    -The key 'b' is added to `dict1` with the value 4.
Iteration 2:
    -The word 'a' appears 1 time in `list1`, which is not equal to `t` (4).
    -The condition `(list1.count(i) == t)` is false.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.

After the loop completes, the value of `dict1` is {'b': 4}.
The function returns the dictionary `dict1`.
