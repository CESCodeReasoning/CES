The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "<<><>>" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '<' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '<' is encountered, so depth becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '>' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '>' is encountered, so depth becomes 0.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '<' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '>' is encountered, so depth becomes 0.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `depth == 0`, which is True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `correct_bracketing("<<><>>")` is True.
