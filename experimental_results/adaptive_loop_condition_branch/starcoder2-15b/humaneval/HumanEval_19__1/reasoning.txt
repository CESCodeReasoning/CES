The function sort_numbers takes a string of numbers as input and returns a string of sorted numbers.
To sort the numbers, the function first splits the input string into a list of individual numbers.
It then creates a dictionary that maps each number word to its corresponding integer value.
The function then sorts the list of numbers using the dictionary to determine the order of the numbers.
Finally, the function joins the sorted list of numbers back into a string and returns it.
