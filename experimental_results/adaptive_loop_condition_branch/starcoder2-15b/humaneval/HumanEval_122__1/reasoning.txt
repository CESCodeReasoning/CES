The function add_elements takes two arguments: an array arr and an integer k.
It returns the sum of the first k elements of arr that have a length of at most 2.

To determine the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9] and 4, we need to:
1. Determine the first 4 elements of the array [11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9]. These are [11,21,3,90].
2. Determine which elements of the array [11,21,3,90] have a length of at most 2. These are [11,21,3].
3. Sum the elements [11,21,3]. The sum is 35.

Therefore, the output of executing the function add_elements on the input [11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9] and 4 is 35.
