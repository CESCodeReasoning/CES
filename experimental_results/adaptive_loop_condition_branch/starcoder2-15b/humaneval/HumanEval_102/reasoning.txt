The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 12, y = 15 ).
`x` is 12, which is not greater than `y` (15).
The condition `x > y` is false, therefore the first if branch is not taken.
`y` is 15, which is not divisible by 2.
The condition `y % 2 == 0` is false, therefore the second if branch is not taken.
`x` is 12, which is not equal to `y` (15).
The condition `x == y` is false, therefore the third if branch is not taken.
The function returns `y - 1`, which is 14.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(12, 15)` is 14.
