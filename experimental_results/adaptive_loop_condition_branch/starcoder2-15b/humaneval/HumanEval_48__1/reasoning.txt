The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'aaaaa' ).
Inside the function, the loop iterates from 0 through 4 (since len(text) = 5).

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'a' at index 0 is equal to the character 'a' at index 4 (since len(text) - 1 - 0 = 4).
    -The condition `text[i]!= text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'a' at index 1 is equal to the character 'a' at index 3 (since len(text) - 1 - 1 = 3).
    -The condition `text[i]!= text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'a' at index 2 is equal to the character 'a' at index 2 (since len(text) - 1 - 2 = 2).
    -The condition `text[i]!= text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'a' at index 3 is equal to the character 'a' at index 1 (since len(text) - 1 - 3 = 1).
    -The condition `text[i]!= text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 'a' at index 4 is equal to the character 'a' at index 0 (since len(text) - 1 - 4 = 0).
    -The condition `text[i]!= text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.

After the loop completes, the function returns True, indicating that the text is a palindrome.
