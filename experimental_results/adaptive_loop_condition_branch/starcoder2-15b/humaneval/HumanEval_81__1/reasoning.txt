The function `numerical_letter_grade` is called with ( grades = [0, 0.7] ).
Inside the function, a variable `letter_grade` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of the list is 0, which is not equal to 4.0.
    -The condition `gpa == 4.0` is false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 3.7` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 3.3` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 3.0` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 2.7` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 2.3` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 2.0` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 1.7` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 1.3` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 1.0` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 0.7` is true.
    -The next condition `gpa > 0.0` is also true.
    -The else block is not executed.
    -The letter grade for the first element is appended to the list: `letter_grade = ["D-"]`.

Iteration 2:
    -The second element of the list is 0.7, which is not equal to 4.0.
    -The condition `gpa == 4.0` is false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 3.7` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 3.3` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 3.0` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 2.7` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 2.3` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 2.0` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 1.7` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 1.3` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 1.0` is also false.
    -The next condition `gpa > 0.7` is true.
    -The next condition `gpa > 0.0` is also true.
    -The else block is not executed.
    -The letter grade for the second element is appended to the list: `letter_grade = ["D-", "D-"]`.

The function returns the list of letter grades: `["D-", "D-"]`.
