The function `any_int` is called with ( x = 2, y = 3, z = 1 ).
`x`, `y`, and `z` are all integers, which satisfies (isinstance(x,int) and isinstance(y,int) and isinstance(z,int)), the if branch is taken.
The condition (x+y==z) is False, (x+z==y) is False, and (y+z==x) is True.
The condition ((x+y==z) or (x+z==y) or (y+z==x)) is True, and the function returns True.
