The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'a b c d g' ).
Inside the function, a variable `dict1` is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The variable `list1` is initialized to the list of words in `test` after splitting it by spaces.
The variable `t` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The word 'a' is not in `list1`, so the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is false.
    -The condition `i!= ''` is true, so the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is false.
    -The condition `(list1.count(i) > t)` is false, so the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is false.
    -The branch is not taken.
Iteration 2:
    -The word 'b' is not in `list1`, so the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is false.
    -The condition `i!= ''` is true, so the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is false.
    -The condition `(list1.count(i) > t)` is false, so the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is false.
    -The branch is not taken.
Iteration 3:
    -The word 'c' is not in `list1`, so the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is false.
    -The condition `i!= ''` is true, so the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is false.
    -The condition `(list1.count(i) > t)` is false, so the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is false.
    -The branch is not taken.
Iteration 4:
    -The word 'd' is not in `list1`, so the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is false.
    -The condition `i!= ''` is true, so the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is false.
    -The condition `(list1.count(i) > t)` is false, so the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is false.
    -The branch is not taken.
Iteration 5:
    -The word 'g' is not in `list1`, so the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is false.
    -The condition `i!= ''` is true, so the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is false.
    -The condition `(list1.count(i) > t)` is false, so the condition `(list1.count(i) > t) and i!= ''` is false.
    -The branch is not taken.

The condition `(t > 0)` is false, so the branch is not taken.

The function returns an empty dictionary.
