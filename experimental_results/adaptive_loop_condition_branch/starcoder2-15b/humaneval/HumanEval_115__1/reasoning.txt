The function max_fill takes two arguments: grid, which is a 2D array of integers, and capacity, which is an integer.
The function returns the maximum number of fills that can be made in the grid, where each fill is a contiguous block of cells with a total capacity of at most capacity.

To determine the output of executing the function max_fill on the input [[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], 2, we need to consider the following steps:
1. Calculate the sum of each array in the grid: [1,1,1,1] -> 4, [1,1,1,1] -> 4
2. Divide each sum by capacity: 4 / 2 = 2, 4 / 2 = 2
3. Round each result up to the nearest integer: math.ceil(2) = 2, math.ceil(2) = 2
4. Sum the rounded results: 2 + 2 = 4

Therefore, the output of executing the function max_fill on the input [[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], 2 is 4.
