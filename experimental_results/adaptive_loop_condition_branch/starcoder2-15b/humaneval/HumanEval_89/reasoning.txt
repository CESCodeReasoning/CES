The function `encrypt` is called with ( s = 'hi' ).
Inside the function, a variable `d` is initialized to 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
The variable `out` is initialized to an empty string.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'h' is in d, so the condition is true.
    -The index of 'h' in d is 7.
    -The index of the new character in d is (7 + 2*2) % 26 = 11.
    -The new character is 'l'.
    -The new string is 'l'.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'i' is in d, so the condition is true.
    -The index of 'i' in d is 8.
    -The index of the new character in d is (8 + 2*2) % 26 = 12.
    -The new character is'm'.
    -The new string is 'lm'.
