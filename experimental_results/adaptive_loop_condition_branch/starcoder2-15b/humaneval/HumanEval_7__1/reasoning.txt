The function filter_by_substring takes two arguments: a list of strings and a substring.
It returns a new list containing only the strings from the original list that contain the substring.

In this case, the function is called with a list of strings and the substring 'xx'.
The function iterates over each string in the list and checks if the substring 'xx' is present in the string.
If it is, the string is added to the new list.

The output of the function call is a new list containing only the strings that contain the substring 'xx'.
