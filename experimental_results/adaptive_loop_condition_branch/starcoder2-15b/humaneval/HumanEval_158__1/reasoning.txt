The function find_max takes a list of words as input and returns the word with the maximum length.
To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "enam", "game"], we need to sort the words by their length in descending order.
The word with the maximum length is "game", which has a length of 4.
Therefore, the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "enam", "game"] is "game".
