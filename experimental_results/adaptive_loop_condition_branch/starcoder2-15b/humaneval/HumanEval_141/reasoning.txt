The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = "example.txt" ).
Inside the function, the variable `suf` is initialized to ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'].
The variable `lst` is initialized to the result of splitting the file_name by the '.' character.
The file_name is split into ['example', 'txt'].
The length of `lst` is 2, which does not equal 2.
The condition `len(lst)!= 2` is false.
The `if` branch is not taken and the function continues to the next `if` statement.
The variable `lst[1]` is 'txt', which is not in the list `suf`.
The condition `not lst[1] in suf` is true.
The `if` branch is taken and the function returns 'No'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `file_name_check("example.txt")` is 'No'.
