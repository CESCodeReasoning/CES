The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [135, 103, 31] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_digit_elements` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 135 is passed to the for loop.
    -The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is evaluated.
    -The string representation of 135 is "135".
    -The for loop iterates over each character in the string "135".
    -The character '1' is passed to the condition.
    -The integer value of '1' is 1.
    -The condition evaluates to True because 1 % 2 == 1.
    -The character '3' is passed to the condition.
    -The integer value of '3' is 3.
    -The condition evaluates to True because 3 % 2 == 1.
    -The character '5' is passed to the condition.
    -The integer value of '5' is 5.
    -The condition evaluates to True because 5 % 2 == 1.
    -The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` evaluates to True because all characters in the string "135" satisfy the condition.
    -The number 135 is appended to the list `odd_digit_elements`.

Iteration 2:
    -The number 103 is passed to the for loop.
    -The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is evaluated.
    -The string representation of 103 is "103".
    -The for loop iterates over each character in the string "103".
    -The character '1' is passed to the condition.
    -The integer value of '1' is 1.
    -The condition evaluates to True because 1 % 2 == 1.
    -The character '0' is passed to the condition.
    -The integer value of '0' is 0.
    -The condition evaluates to False because 0 % 2 == 0.
    -The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` evaluates to False because not all characters in the string "103" satisfy the condition.
    -The number 103 is not appended to the list `odd_digit_elements`.

Iteration 3:
    -The number 31 is passed to the for loop.
    -The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` is evaluated.
    -The string representation of 31 is "31".
    -The for loop iterates over each character in the string "31".
    -The character '3' is passed to the condition.
    -The integer value of '3' is 3.
    -The condition evaluates to True because 3 % 2 == 1.
    -The character '1' is passed to the condition.
    -The integer value of '1' is 1.
    -The condition evaluates to True because 1 % 2 == 1.
    -The condition `all(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` evaluates to True because all characters in the string "31" satisfy the condition.
    -The number 31 is appended to the list `odd_digit_elements`.

After the for loop completes, the list `odd_digit_elements` contains the numbers 135 and 31.
The list is sorted in ascending order and returned.
