The function find_max takes a list of strings as input and returns the string with the maximum length.
To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "of", "string"], we need to sort the list of strings by their length in descending order.
Therefore, the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "of", "string"] is "string".
