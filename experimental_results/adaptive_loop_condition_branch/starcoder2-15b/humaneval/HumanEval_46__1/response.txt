<fim_prefix>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[/INPUT]

[ANSWER]
def sum_of_integer(N, K):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1): ## [STATE]i=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5][/STATE][STATE]range(1,N+1)=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5][/STATE][STATE]N+1=[6][/STATE]
        sum += i
    if sum > K: ## [CONDITION](sum > K)=[True] [/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return True
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return False
[/ANSWER]

[REASONING]
The function `sum_of_integer` is called with ( N = 5, K=10).
Inside the function, a variable `sum` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( N = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 3 ( 1 + 2 = 3 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 6 ( 3 + 3 = 6 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 10 ( 6 + 4 = 10 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 15 ( 10 + 5 = 1 ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( sum > K ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `True` as the output.
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
True

def sum_elements(elements, K):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(elements)): ## [STATE]i=??[/STATE][STATE]len(elements)=??[/STATE][STATE]range(len(elements))=??[/STATE]
        total += elements[i]
    if total > K: ## [CONDITION](total > K)=??[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return True
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return False
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sum_elements([10, 20, 30, 40, 50], 100)
[/INPUT]


[REASONING]
The function `sum_elements` is called with ( elements = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], K = 100 ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 4 (since ( len(elements) = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    elements[i] = 10, `total += elements[i]` updates `total` to 1 ( 0 + 10 = 10 ).
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    elements[i] = 20, `total += elements[i]` updates `total` to 30 ( 10 + 20 = 30 ).
Third Iteration (i = 2)
    elements[i] = 30, `total += elements[i]` updates `total` to 60 ( 30 + 30 = 60 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
    elements[i] = 40, `total += elements[i]` updates `total` to 100 ( 60 + 40 = 100 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
    elements[i] = 50, `total += elements[i]` updates `total` to 150 ( 100 + 50 = 150 ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( total > K ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `True` as the output.

from typing import *


def fib4(n: int):

        results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4])
        results.pop(0)

    return results[-1]
[/ANSWER]

[REASONING]
The function `fib4` is called with ( n = 12 ).
Inside the function, a list `results` is initialized to [0, 0, 2, 0].
The condition ( n < 4 ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The loop iterates from 4 through 12 (since ( n + 1 = 13 )).
First Iteration (_ = 4):
    results[-1] = 0, results[-2] = 0, results[-3] = 2, results[-4] = 0, results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates results to [0, 0, 2, 0, 2], results.pop(0) removes the first element from results, which is 0.
Second Iteration (_ = 5):
    results[-1] = 0, results[-2] = 2, results[-3] = 0, results[-4] = 2, results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates results to [0, 2, 0, 2, 4], results.pop(0) removes the first element from results, which is 0.
Third Iteration (_ = 6)
    results[-1] = 2, results[-2] = 0, results[-3] = 2, results[-4] = 4, results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates results to [2, 0, 2, 4, 8], results.pop(0) removes the first element from results, which is 2.
Fourth Iteration (_ = 7)
    results[-1] = 0, results[-2] = 2, results[-3] = 4, results[-4] = 8, results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates results to [0, 2, 4, 8, 14], results.pop(0) removes the first element from results, which is 0.
Fifth Iteration (_ = 8)
    results[-1] = 2, results[-2] = 4, results[-3] = 8, results[-4] = 14, results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates results to [2, 4, 8, 14, 26], results.pop(0) removes the first element from results, which is 2.
Sixth Iteration (_ = 9)
    results[-1] = 4, results[-2] = 8, results[-3] = 14, results[-4] = 26, results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates results to [4, 8, 14, 26, 46], results.pop(0) removes the first element from results, which is 4.
Seventh Iteration (_ = 10)
    results[-1] = 8, results[-2] = 14, results[-3] = 26, results[-4] = 46, results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates results to [8, 14, 26, 46, 80], results.pop(0) removes the first element from results, which is 8.
Eighth Iteration (_ = 11)
    results[-1] = 14, results[-2] = 26, results[-3] = 46, results[-4] = 80, results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates results to [14, 26, 46, 80, 146], results.pop(0) removes the first element from results, which is 14.
Ninth Iteration (_ = 12)
    results[-1] = 26, results[-2] = 46, results[-3] = 80, results[-4] = 146, results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates results to [26, 46, 80, 146, 272], results.pop(0) removes the first element from results, which is 26.
After the loop completes, the function returns the last element of results, which is 272.

        return 1
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
[/ANSWER]

[REASONING]
The function `fibonacci` is called with ( n = 10 ).
Inside the function, the condition ( n == 0 ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition ( n == 1 ) is not satisfied, therefore the elif branch is not taken.
The else branch is taken, and the function calls itself recursively with ( n - 1 = 9 ) and ( n - 2 = 8 ).
The function calls itself recursively with ( n - 1 = 8 ) and ( n - 2 = 7 ).
The function calls itself recursively with ( n - 1 = 7 ) and ( n - 2 = 6 ).
The function calls itself recursively with ( n - 1 = 6 ) and ( n - 2 = 5 ).
The function calls itself recursively with ( n - 1 = 5 ) and ( n - 2 = 4 ).
The function calls itself recursively with ( n - 1 = 4 ) and ( n - 2 = 3 ).
The function calls itself recursively with ( n - 1 = 3 ) and ( n - 2 = 2 ).
The function calls itself recursively with ( n - 1 = 2 ) and ( n - 2 = 1 ).
The function calls itself recursively with ( n - 1 = 1 ) and ( n - 2 = 0 ).
The condition ( n == 0 ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns 0.
The function calls itself recursively with ( n - 1 = 0 ) and ( n - 2 = -1 ).
The condition ( n == 1 ) is satisfied, therefore the elif branch is taken and the function returns 1.
The function calls itself recursively with ( n - 1 = 1 ) and ( n - 2 = 0 ).
The condition ( n == 0 ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns 0.
The function calls itself recursively with ( n - 1 = 0 ) and ( n - 2 = -1 ).
The condition ( n == 1 ) is satisfied, therefore the elif branch is taken and the function returns 1.
