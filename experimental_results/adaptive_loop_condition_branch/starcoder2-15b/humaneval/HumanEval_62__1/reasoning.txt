The function derivative takes a list of numbers xs as input and returns a new list of numbers.
The new list is obtained by multiplying each element of xs with its index and then removing the first element.
To determine the output of executing the function derivative on the input [3, 2, 1], we need to multiply each element with its index and then remove the first element.
Therefore, the output of executing the function derivative on the input [3, 2, 1] is [2, 1].
