The function cycpattern_check(a, b) takes two strings a and b as its parameters.
The function returns True if the pattern b is found in the string a, otherwise it returns False.
The function first checks if the length of the pattern b is greater than or equal to the length of the string a. If it is, then the pattern cannot be found in the string, so the function returns False.
The function then creates a new string pat by concatenating the pattern b with itself.
The function then iterates through all possible starting indices i of the pattern in the string a.
For each starting index i, the function iterates through all possible starting indices j of the pattern in the concatenated string pat.
For each pair of starting indices i and j, the function checks if the pattern b is found in the string a starting at index i and in the concatenated string pat starting at index j.
If the pattern is found in either of the two strings, the function returns True.
If the pattern is not found in either of the two strings, the function returns False.
