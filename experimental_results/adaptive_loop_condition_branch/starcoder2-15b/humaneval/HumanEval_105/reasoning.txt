The function `by_length` is called with (arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]).
Inside the function, a variable `dic` is initialized to a dictionary with keys 1 to 9 and values "One" to "Nine".
`sorted_arr` is initialized to the sorted version of `arr` in descending order.
`new_arr` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates through each element in `sorted_arr`.

First Iteration (var = 8):
    `dic[var]` is 8, which is not in the dictionary.
    The try block raises a KeyError, and the except block is executed.
    The element is not added to `new_arr`.
Second Iteration (var = 5):
    `dic[var]` is 5, which is not in the dictionary.
    The try block raises a KeyError, and the except block is executed.
    The element is not added to `new_arr`.
Third Iteration (var = 4):
    `dic[var]` is 4, which is in the dictionary.
    The try block executes successfully, and the element is added to `new_arr`.
    `new_arr` becomes ["Four"].
Fourth Iteration (var = 3):
    `dic[var]` is 3, which is in the dictionary.
    The try block executes successfully, and the element is added to `new_arr`.
    `new_arr` becomes ["Four", "Three"].
Fifth Iteration (var = 2):
    `dic[var]` is 2, which is in the dictionary.
    The try block executes successfully, and the element is added to `new_arr`.
    `new_arr` becomes ["Four", "Three", "Two"].
Sixth Iteration (var = 2):
    `dic[var]` is 2, which is in the dictionary.
    The try block executes successfully, and the element is added to `new_arr`.
    `new_arr` becomes ["Four", "Three", "Two", "Two"].
Seventh Iteration (var = 1):
    `dic[var]` is 1, which is in the dictionary.
    The try block executes successfully, and the element is added to `new_arr`.
    `new_arr` becomes ["Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One"].
Eighth Iteration (var = 1):
    `dic[var]` is 1, which is in the dictionary.
    The try block executes successfully, and the element is added to `new_arr`.
    `new_arr` becomes ["Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"].
