The function compare takes two lists game and guess as input and returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input [1,2,3,5] and [-1,2,3,4], we need to calculate the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists.
Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input [1,2,3,5] and [-1,2,3,4] is [2,0,0,1].
