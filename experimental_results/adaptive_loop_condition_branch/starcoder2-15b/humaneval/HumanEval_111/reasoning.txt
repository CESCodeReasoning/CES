The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'a b b a' ).
Inside the function, a variable `dict1` is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The variable `list1` is initialized to the result of splitting the input string `test` by spaces.
The variable `t` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of `list1` is 'a'.
    -The condition `list1.count(i)>t` is evaluated to `False` since `list1.count('a')` is 1 and `t` is 0.
    -The condition `i!=''` is evaluated to `True` since `i` is not an empty string.
    -The condition `(list1.count(i)>t) and i!=''` is evaluated to `False`.
    -The `if` block is not executed.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element of `list1` is 'b'.
    -The condition `list1.count(i)>t` is evaluated to `True` since `list1.count('b')` is 2 and `t` is 0.
    -The condition `i!=''` is evaluated to `True` since `i` is not an empty string.
    -The condition `(list1.count(i)>t) and i!=''` is evaluated to `True`.
    -The `if` block is executed.
    -The value of `t` is updated to 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The third element of `list1` is 'b'.
    -The condition `list1.count(i)>t` is evaluated to `False` since `list1.count('b')` is 2 and `t` is 2.
    -The condition `i!=''` is evaluated to `True` since `i` is not an empty string.
    -The condition `(list1.count(i)>t) and i!=''` is evaluated to `False`.
    -The `if` block is not executed.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth element of `list1` is 'a'.
    -The condition `list1.count(i)>t` is evaluated to `False` since `list1.count('a')` is 1 and `t` is 2.
    -The condition `i!=''` is evaluated to `True` since `i` is not an empty string.
    -The condition `(list1.count(i)>t) and i!=''` is evaluated to `False`.
    -The `if` block is not executed.
