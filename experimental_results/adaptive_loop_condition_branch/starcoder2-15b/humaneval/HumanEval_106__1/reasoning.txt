The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates from 1 to n + 1.
For each iteration, if i is even, calculate the factorial of i and append it to ret.
Otherwise, calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to i and append it to ret.
First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, which is odd.
    - Calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to 1 (1).
    - Append 1 to ret.
Second Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, which is even.
    - Calculate the factorial of 2 (2).
    - Append 2 to ret.
Third Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, which is odd.
    - Calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to 3 (6).
    - Append 6 to ret.
Fourth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, which is even.
    - Calculate the factorial of 4 (24).
    - Append 24 to ret.
Fifth Iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, which is odd.
    - Calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to 5 (15).
    - Append 15 to ret.
Sixth Iteration (i=6):
    - `i` is 6, which is even.
    - Calculate the factorial of 6 (720).
    - Append 720 to ret.
Seventh Iteration (i=7):
    - `i` is 7, which is odd.
    - Calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to 7 (28).
    - Append 28 to ret.
