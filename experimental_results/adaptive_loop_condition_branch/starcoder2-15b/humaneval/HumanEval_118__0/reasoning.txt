The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "full" ).
Inside the function, a variable `vowels` is initialized to a set of vowels.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of the word is 4, which is greater than 3.
    -The condition `len(word) < 3` is false.
    -The loop iterates from 2 to 0 (since ( len(word) - 2 = 2 )).
    -The character at index 2 is 'l', which is not in vowels.
    -The condition `word[i] in vowels` is false.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 2:
    -The character at index 1 is 'u', which is not in vowels.
    -The condition `word[i] in vowels` is false.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 3:
    -The character at index 0 is 'f', which is not in vowels.
    -The condition `word[i] in vowels` is false.
    -The loop continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 4:
    -The loop ends since the index is less than 0.
    -The function returns an empty string.
