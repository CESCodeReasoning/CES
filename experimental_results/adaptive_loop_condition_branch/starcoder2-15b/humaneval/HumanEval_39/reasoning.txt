The function `prime_fib` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, a variable `f` is initialized to [0, 1].
The loop iterates until the condition `n == 0` is met.
First Iteration (f = [0, 1]):
    - The condition `n == 0` is false.
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is false.
    - The loop continues.
Second Iteration (f = [0, 1, 1]):
    - The condition `n == 0` is false.
    - The condition `is_prime(f[-1])` is true.
    - The value of `n` is decremented by 1.
Third Iteration (f = [0, 1, 1, 2]):
