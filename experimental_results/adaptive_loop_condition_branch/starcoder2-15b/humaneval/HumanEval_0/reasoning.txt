The function has_close_elements(numbers, threshold) takes a list of numbers([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]) and a threshold(0.3) as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by idx in the outer loop, compare it with every other element in the list.
