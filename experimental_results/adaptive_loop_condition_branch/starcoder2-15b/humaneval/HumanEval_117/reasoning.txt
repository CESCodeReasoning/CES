The function select_words(s, n) takes a string s and an integer n as its parameters.
The function splits the string s into a list of words and iterates through each word.
For each word, the function counts the number of consonants in the word.
If the number of consonants is equal to n, the word is appended to the result list.
The function returns the result list.
