The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["d", "dcba", "abcd", "a"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order.

Iteration 1:
    -The length of the string 'd' is 1, which is an odd number.
    -The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is false, so the string 'd' is not appended to the list `new_lst`.
Iteration 2:
    -The length of the string 'dcba' is 4, which is an even number.
    -The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true, so the string 'dcba' is appended to the list `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The length of the string 'abcd' is 4, which is an even number.
    -The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true, so the string 'abcd' is appended to the list `new_lst`.
Iteration 4:
    -The length of the string 'a' is 1, which is an odd number.
    -The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is false, so the string 'a' is not appended to the list `new_lst`.

After the loop completes, the list `new_lst` contains the strings 'dcba' and 'abcd', sorted by length in ascending order.

The function then returns the sorted list `new_lst`.
