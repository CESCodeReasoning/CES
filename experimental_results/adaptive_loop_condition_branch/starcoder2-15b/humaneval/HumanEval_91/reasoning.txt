The function is_bored takes a string S as input and returns the number of sentences in S that start with "I ".
To determine the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "Hello world", we need to split the input string into sentences using the regular expression r'[.?!]\s*'.
The regular expression r'[.?!]\s*' matches any of the characters '.', '?', or '!' followed by zero or more whitespace characters.
After splitting the input string into sentences, we count the number of sentences that start with "I " using a generator expression.
The generator expression (sentence[0:2] == 'I'for sentence in sentences) generates a boolean value for each sentence in sentences indicating whether the sentence starts with "I ".
The sum function then sums up the boolean values to obtain the total number of sentences that start with "I ".
Therefore, the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "Hello world" is 0.
