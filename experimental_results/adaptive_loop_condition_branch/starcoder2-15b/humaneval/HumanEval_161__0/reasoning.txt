The function `solve` is called with ( s = "#a@C" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '#' is not an alphabet, so flg remains 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'a' is an alphabet, so flg becomes 1.
    -The character 'a' is converted to uppercase 'A' and stored in the new_str list.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '@' is not an alphabet, so flg remains 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'C' is an alphabet, so flg remains 1.
    -The character 'C' is converted to lowercase 'c' and stored in the new_str list.

After the loop, the new_str list is ['#', 'A', '@', 'c'].

The if statement checks if flg is equal to 0. Since flg is 1, the if statement is not executed.

The function returns the new_str list joined into a string, which is "#Ac".
