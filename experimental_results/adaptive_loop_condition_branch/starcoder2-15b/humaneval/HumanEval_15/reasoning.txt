The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string that represents a sequence of numbers from 0 to n.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 0, we need to generate a string that represents a sequence of numbers from 0 to 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 0 is "0".
