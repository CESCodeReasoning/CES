The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "abcde" ).
The variable `vowels` is initialized to the string "aeiouAEIOU".
The variable `n_vowels` is initialized to the sum of the number of characters in `s` that are in `vowels`.
In this case, the sum is 0, since none of the characters in `s` are in `vowels`.
The last character of `s` is 'e', which is not 'y' or 'Y'.
The condition `s[-1] == 'y' or s[-1] == 'Y'` is false.
The `if` block is not executed, and the function returns the value of `n_vowels`, which is 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("abcde")` is 0.
