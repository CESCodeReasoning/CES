The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [0, 10, 20, 1000000] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 0 is added to s, which becomes 0.
    -The condition (s < 0) is false, so the if statement is not executed.
    -max_sum is set to 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 10 is added to s, which becomes 10.
    -The condition (s < 0) is false, so the if statement is not executed.
    -max_sum is set to 10.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 20 is added to s, which becomes 30.
    -The condition (s < 0) is false, so the if statement is not executed.
    -max_sum is set to 30.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 1000000 is added to s, which becomes 1000030.
    -The condition (s < 0) is false, so the if statement is not executed.
    -max_sum is set to 1000030.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of min_sum, which is -1000030.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([0, 10, 20, 1000000])` is -1000030.
