The function right_angle_triangle takes three numbers a, b, and c as input and returns True if they form a right-angled triangle, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input 7, 24, and 25, we need to check if the square of the longest side (25) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (7 and 24).
Since 25 * 25 = 625 and 7 * 7 + 24 * 24 = 576, the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input 7, 24, and 25 is False.
