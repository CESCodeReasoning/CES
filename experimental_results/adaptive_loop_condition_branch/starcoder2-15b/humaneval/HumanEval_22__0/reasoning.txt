The function filter_integers takes a list of values as input and returns a new list containing only the integers from the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [], we need to check each element of the input list to see if it is an integer. Since the input list is empty, there are no elements to check, so the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [] is an empty list [].
