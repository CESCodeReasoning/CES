The function select_words(s, n) takes a string s and an integer n as its parameters.
The function splits the string s into a list of words using the split() method.
The function then iterates through each word in the list.
For each word, the function counts the number of consonants using a nested loop.
If the number of consonants is equal to n, the word is appended to the result list.
The function returns the result list.
