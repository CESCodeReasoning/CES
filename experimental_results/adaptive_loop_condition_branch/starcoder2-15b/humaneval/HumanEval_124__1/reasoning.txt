The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '04-2003' ).
Inside the function, the date string is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces.
The date string is then split into three parts using the '-' character as the delimiter.
The three parts are then converted to integers using the int() function.
The month, day, and year variables are assigned the corresponding values.
The function then checks if the month is between 1 and 12.
If the month is not between 1 and 12, the function returns False.
The function then checks if the day is between 1 and 31 for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12.
If the day is not between 1 and 31, the function returns False.
The function then checks if the day is between 1 and 30 for months 4, 6, 9, and 11.
If the day is not between 1 and 30, the function returns False.
The function then checks if the day is between 1 and 29 for month 2.
If the day is not between 1 and 29, the function returns False.
If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('04-2003')` is True.
