The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the positive odd integers in the list that do not contain a decimal point.
To determine the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [0.2, 3, 5], we need to consider the following steps:
1. Filter the list to include only positive odd integers that do not contain a decimal point. In this case, the filtered list is [3, 5].
2. Square each element in the filtered list. In this case, the squared list is [9, 25].
3. Sum the elements in the squared list. In this case, the sum is 34.
Therefore, the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [0.2, 3, 5] is 34.
