The function is_bored takes a string S as input and returns True if the string starts with "I " and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "You and I are going for a walk", we need to check if the first two characters of the string are "I ".
Since the first two characters of the string are "You", the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "You and I are going for a walk" is False.
