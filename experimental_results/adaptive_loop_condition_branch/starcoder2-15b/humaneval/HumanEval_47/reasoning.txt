The function `median` is called with ( l = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5] ).
Inside the function, the list `l` is sorted in ascending order.
The length of the list `l` is 5, which is an odd number.
The condition `len(l) % 2 == 1` is true, therefore the if branch is taken.
The median is calculated as the middle element of the sorted list `l`, which is `l[len(l) // 2]`.
In this case, the middle element is `3`, so the function returns 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])` is 3.
