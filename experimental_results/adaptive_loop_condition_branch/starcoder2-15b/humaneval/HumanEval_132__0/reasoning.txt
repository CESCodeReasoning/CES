The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = '[][][[]]' ).
Inside the function, a variable `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` are initialized to empty lists.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '[' is found at index 0, so opening_bracket_index becomes [0].
Iteration 2:
    -The character ']' is found at index 1, so closing_bracket_index becomes [1].
Iteration 3:
    -The character '[' is found at index 2, so opening_bracket_index becomes [0, 2].
Iteration 4:
    -The character ']' is found at index 3, so closing_bracket_index becomes [1, 3].
Iteration 5:
    -The character '[' is found at index 4, so opening_bracket_index becomes [0, 2, 4].
Iteration 6:
    -The character ']' is found at index 5, so closing_bracket_index becomes [1, 3, 5].
Iteration 7:
    -The character '[' is found at index 6, so opening_bracket_index becomes [0, 2, 4, 6].
Iteration 8:
    -The character ']' is found at index 7, so closing_bracket_index becomes [1, 3, 5, 7].
Iteration 9:
    -The character '[' is found at index 8, so opening_bracket_index becomes [0, 2, 4, 6, 8].
Iteration 10:
    -The character ']' is found at index 9, so closing_bracket_index becomes [1, 3, 5, 7, 9].

The closing_bracket_index list is reversed to [9, 7, 5, 3, 1].

Iteration 1:
    -The first opening_bracket_index is 0, which is less than the first closing_bracket_index (9).
    -The cnt variable is incremented to 1.
    -The i variable is incremented to 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second opening_bracket_index is 2, which is less than the second closing_bracket_index (7).
    -The cnt variable is incremented to 2.
    -The i variable is incremented to 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The third opening_bracket_index is 4, which is less than the third closing_bracket_index (5).
    -The cnt variable is incremented to 3.
    -The i variable is incremented to 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth opening_bracket_index is 6, which is less than the fourth closing_bracket_index (3).
    -The cnt variable is incremented to 4.
    -The i variable is incremented to 4.
Iteration 5:
    -The fifth opening_bracket_index is 8, which is less than the fifth closing_bracket_index (1).
    -The cnt variable is incremented to 5.
    -The i variable is incremented to 5.

Since cnt is greater than or equal to 2, the function returns True.
