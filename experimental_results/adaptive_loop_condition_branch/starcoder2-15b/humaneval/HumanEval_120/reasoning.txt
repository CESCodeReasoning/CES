The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3 ).
`k` is 3, which is not equal to 0.
The condition `k == 0` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order: [-4, -3, 5].
The last `k` elements of the sorted array are extracted: [-3, 5].
The extracted elements are returned as the output of the function.

Therefore, the final output of the function `maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3)` is [-3, 5].
