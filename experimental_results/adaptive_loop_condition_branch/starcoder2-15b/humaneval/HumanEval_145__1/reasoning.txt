The function `order_by_points` is called with ( nums = [] ).
Inside the function, a function `digits_sum` is defined.
The function `digits_sum` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the digits of `n`.
The function `digits_sum` first checks if `n` is negative. If it is, it multiplies `n` by -1 and sets a variable `neg` to -1.
The function then converts `n` to a string and splits it into individual digits using the `str` function.
The function then converts each digit back to an integer using the `int` function.
The function then multiplies the first digit by `neg` to account for the negative sign.
The function then returns the sum of the digits using the `sum` function.

The function `order_by_points` then returns the sorted version of `nums` using the `sorted` function.
The `sorted` function takes `nums` as input and sorts it based on the `digits_sum` function.
The `digits_sum` function is used as the key for the sorting, which means that the elements in `nums` will be sorted based on the sum of their digits.

Since `nums` is an empty list, the `sorted` function will return an empty list.

Therefore, the final output of the function `order_by_points([])` is [].
