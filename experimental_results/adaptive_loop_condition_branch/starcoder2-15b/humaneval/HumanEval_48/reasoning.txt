The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'xywyx' ).
Inside the function, the loop iterates from 0 through 4 (since len(text) = 5).

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'x' is not equal to 'x', so the condition is false.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'y' is not equal to 'y', so the condition is false.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'w' is not equal to 'w', so the condition is false.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'y' is not equal to 'y', so the condition is false.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 'x' is not equal to 'x', so the condition is false.

Since all the conditions are false, the function returns True.
