The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 2 is added to s, making s equal to -2.
    -Since s is less than 0, s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is set to 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 3 is added to s, making s equal to -5.
    -Since s is less than 0, s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is set to 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 4 is added to s, making s equal to -9.
    -Since s is less than 0, s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is set to 0.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 1 is added to s, making s equal to -10.
    -Since s is less than 0, s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is set to 0.
Iteration 5:
    -The number 2 is added to s, making s equal to -12.
    -Since s is less than 0, s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is set to 0.
Iteration 6:
    -The number 4 is added to s, making s equal to -16.
    -Since s is less than 0, s is set to 0.
    -max_sum is set to 0.

Since max_sum is still 0, the condition (max_sum == 0) is true.
The for loop exits and the function returns the value of -max_sum, which is 0.
