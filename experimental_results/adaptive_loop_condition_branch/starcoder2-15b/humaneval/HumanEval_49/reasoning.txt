The function `modp` is called with (n = 3, p = 5).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 0 to 2 (since n = 3).

First Iteration (i = 0):
    ret = (2 * 1) % 5 = 2
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    ret = (2 * 2) % 5 = 4
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    ret = (2 * 4) % 5 = 3
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ret`, which is now 3.
