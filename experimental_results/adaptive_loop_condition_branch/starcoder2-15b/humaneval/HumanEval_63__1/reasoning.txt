The function `fibfib` is called with ( n = 10 ).
`n` is 10, which does not satisfy ( n == 0 ).
The condition `n == 0` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
`n` is 10, which does not satisfy ( n == 1 ).
The condition `n == 1` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
`n` is 10, which does not satisfy ( n == 2 ).
The condition `n == 2` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
