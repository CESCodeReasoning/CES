The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of all positive odd integers that do not contain a decimal point in their string representation.
To determine the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [-10, -20, -30], we need to consider the following steps:
1. Filter the list to only include positive odd integers: [-10, -20, -30] -> [10, 20, 30]
2. Filter the list to exclude integers that contain a decimal point in their string representation: [10, 20, 30] -> [10, 30]
3. Square each integer in the list: [10, 30] -> [100, 900]
4. Sum the squared integers: 100 + 900 = 1000
Therefore, the output of executing the function double_the_difference on the input [-10, -20, -30] is 1000.
