The function `int_to_mini_roman` is called with ( number = 900 ).
Inside the function, a variable `num` is initialized to a list of integers.
A variable `sym` is initialized to a list of strings.
A variable `i` is initialized to 12.
A variable `res` is initialized to an empty string.
The while loop iterates while number is not equal to 0.
First Iteration:
    - number = 900, div = 900 // 1 = 900.
    - number %= 1 = 0.
    - div = 900, res ='m'.
    - div -= 1, div = 899.
Second Iteration:
    - number = 0, div = 0 // 1 = 0.
    - number %= 1 = 0.
    - div = 0, res ='m'.
    - div -= 1, div = -1.
The while loop terminates since div is now less than 0.
The function returns the value of `res`, which is now'm'.
