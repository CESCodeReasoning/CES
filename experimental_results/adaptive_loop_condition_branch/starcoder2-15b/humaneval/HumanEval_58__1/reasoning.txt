The function common(l1, l2) takes two lists as parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the first list.
The inner loop iterates through each element in the second list.
If an element in the first list is equal to an element in the second list, add it to the set ret.
First Iteration (e1=5):
    - `e1` is 5, e2 in the inner loop is 3, 2.
    - e1 == e2:
        - When e2 = 3, the condition `e1 == e2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When e2 = 2, the condition `e1 == e2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (e1=3):
    - `e1` is 3, e2 in the inner loop is 3, 2.
    - e1 == e2:
        - When e2 = 3, the condition `e1 == e2` is True, the if branch is taken. Add 3 to ret.
        - When e2 = 2, the condition `e1 == e2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (e1=2):
    - `e1` is 2, e2 in the inner loop is 3, 2.
    - e1 == e2:
        - When e2 = 3, the condition `e1 == e2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When e2 = 2, the condition `e1 == e2` is True, the if branch is taken. Add 2 to ret.
Forth Iteration (e1=8):
    - `e1` is 8, e2 in the inner loop is 3, 2.
    - e1 == e2:
        - When e2 = 3, the condition `e1 == e2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When e2 = 2, the condition `e1 == e2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
