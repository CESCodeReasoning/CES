The function `exchange` is called with ( lst1 = [100, 200], lst2 = [200, 200] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 100 is not odd, so even becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 200 is not odd, so even becomes 2.
Iteration 1:
    -The number 200 is not even, so odd becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 200 is not even, so odd becomes 2.

Since even is greater than or equal to odd, the function returns "YES".
