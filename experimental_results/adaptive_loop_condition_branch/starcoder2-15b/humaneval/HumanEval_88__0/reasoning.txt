The function sort_array takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted version of the array.
The sorting is done in ascending order if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, and in descending order otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], we need to check if the sum of the first and last elements is even.
Since 2 + 6 = 8, which is even, the sorting is done in ascending order.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6] is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
