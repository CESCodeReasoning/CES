The function `solve` is called with ( s = "AsDf" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'A' is an alphabet, so flg becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character's' is an alphabet, so flg becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'D' is an alphabet, so flg becomes 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'f' is an alphabet, so flg becomes 1.

After the loop, the function returns the value of `s`, which is now "aSdF".
