The function `words_string` is called with ( s = "One, two, three, four, five, six" ).
Inside the function, a variable `s_list` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'O' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'n' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'e' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ',' is equal to ',', so a space is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 5:
    -The character'' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character 't' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character 'w' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 8:
    -The character 'o' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 9:
    -The character ',' is equal to ',', so a space is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 10:
    -The character'' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 11:
    -The character 't' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 12:
    -The character 'h' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 13:
    -The character 'r' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 14:
    -The character 'e' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 15:
    -The character 'e' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 16:
    -The character ',' is equal to ',', so a space is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 17:
    -The character'' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 18:
    -The character 'f' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 19:
    -The character 'o' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 20:
    -The character 'u' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 21:
    -The character 'r' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 22:
    -The character ',' is equal to ',', so a space is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 23:
    -The character'' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 24:
    -The character 'f' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 25:
    -The character 'i' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 26:
    -The character 'v' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 27:
    -The character 'e' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 28:
    -The character ',' is equal to ',', so a space is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 29:
    -The character'' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 30:
    -The character's' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 31:
    -The character 'i' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 32:
    -The character 'x' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 33:
    -The character ',' is equal to ',', so a space is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 34:
    -The character'' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 35:
    -The character's' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 36:
    -The character 'i' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 37:
    -The character 'x' is not equal to ',', so the character is appended to `s_list`.

After the loop, the function returns the value of `s_list`, which is now a list of words separated by spaces.

Therefore, the final output of the function `words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six")` is ['One', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five','six'].
