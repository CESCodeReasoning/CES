The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [4, 3, 2, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None.
The variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of the list is 4.
    -Since `running_max` is None, it is set to 4.
    -The element 4 is appended to the `result` list.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element of the list is 3.
    -Since `running_max` is not None, it is compared with 3.
    -The maximum value between 4 and 3 is 4.
    -The element 4 is appended to the `result` list.
Iteration 3:
    -The third element of the list is 2.
    -Since `running_max` is not None, it is compared with 2.
    -The maximum value between 4 and 2 is 4.
    -The element 4 is appended to the `result` list.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth and last element of the list is 1.
    -Since `running_max` is not None, it is compared with 1.
    -The maximum value between 4 and 1 is 4.
    -The element 4 is appended to the `result` list.

The function returns the `result` list, which contains the maximum value of each sublist up to that point.
