The function sort_array takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted version of the array.
The sorting is done in descending order if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, and in ascending order otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [15, 42, 87, 32,11, 0], we need to determine the sum of the first and last elements of the array.
The first element of the array is 15, and the last element is 0. The sum of these two elements is 15 + 0 = 15, which is an odd number.
Therefore, the sorting is done in ascending order, and the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [15, 42, 87, 32,11, 0] is [0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87].
