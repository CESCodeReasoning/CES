The function `Strongest_Extension` is called with ( class_name = 'finNNalLLly', extensions = ['Die', 'NowW', 'Wow', 'WoW'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `strong` is initialized to the first element of `extensions` (i.e., 'Die').
A variable `my_val` is initialized to the difference between the number of uppercase letters and lowercase letters in `strong` (i.e., 'Die').

The loop iterates over each element `s` in `extensions`.
First Iteration (s = 'Die')
   - The condition `val > my_val` is false, since `val` (0) is not greater than `my_val` (0).
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Second Iteration (s = 'NowW')
   - The condition `val > my_val` is true, since `val` (2) is greater than `my_val` (0).
   - `strong` is updated to 'NowW', and `my_val` is updated to 2.
Third Iteration (s = 'Wow')
   - The condition `val > my_val` is false, since `val` (0) is not greater than `my_val` (2).
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.
Fourth Iteration (s = 'WoW')
   - The condition `val > my_val` is false, since `val` (0) is not greater than `my_val` (2).
   - The loop continues to the next iteration.

After the loop completes, the function returns the concatenation of `class_name` and `strong` (i.e., 'finNNalLLly.NowW').
