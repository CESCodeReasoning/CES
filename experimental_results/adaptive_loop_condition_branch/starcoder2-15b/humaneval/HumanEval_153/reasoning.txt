The function `Strongest_Extension` is called with ( class_name = "Watashi", extensions = ["tEN", "niNE", "eIGHt8OKe"] ).
Inside the function, a variable `strong` is initialized to the first element of `extensions`, which is "tEN".
The variable `my_val` is initialized to the difference between the number of uppercase letters and lowercase letters in "tEN".
The loop iterates over each element in `extensions`.

Iteration 1:
    - The element is "tEN".
    - The value of `val` is calculated as the difference between the number of uppercase letters and lowercase letters in "tEN", which is 0.
    - The condition `val > my_val` is false, so the `if` block is not executed.

Iteration 2:
    - The element is "niNE".
    - The value of `val` is calculated as the difference between the number of uppercase letters and lowercase letters in "niNE", which is 1.
    - The condition `val > my_val` is true, so the `if` block is executed.
    - The value of `strong` is updated to "niNE".
    - The value of `my_val` is updated to 1.

Iteration 3:
    - The element is "eIGHt8OKe".
    - The value of `val` is calculated as the difference between the number of uppercase letters and lowercase letters in "eIGHt8OKe", which is 2.
    - The condition `val > my_val` is true, so the `if` block is executed.
    - The value of `strong` is updated to "eIGHt8OKe".
    - The value of `my_val` is updated to 2.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is "Watashi.eIGHt8OKe".
