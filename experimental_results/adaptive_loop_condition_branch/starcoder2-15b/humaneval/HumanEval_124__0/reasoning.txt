The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '01-01-2007' ).
Inside the function, the date string is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces.
The date string is then split into three parts using the '-' character as the delimiter.
The month, day, and year parts are converted to integers.
The first conditional statement checks if the month is less than 1 or greater than 12.
If the month is less than 1 or greater than 12, the function returns False.
The second conditional statement checks if the month is in the list [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and the day is less than 1 or greater than 31.
If the month is not in the list and the day is not between 1 and 31, the function returns False.
The third conditional statement checks if the month is in the list [4, 6, 9, 11] and the day is less than 1 or greater than 30.
If the month is not in the list and the day is not between 1 and 30, the function returns False.
The fourth conditional statement checks if the month is 2 and the day is less than 1 or greater than 29.
If the month is not 2 or the day is not between 1 and 29, the function returns False.
If none of the conditions are met, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('01-01-2007')` is True.
