The function `x_or_y` is called with ( n = 3, x = 33, y = 5212 ).
Inside the function, the condition `n == 1` is evaluated.
Since `n` is not equal to 1, the condition is false.
The loop iterates from 2 to 2 (since `n` is 3).
The condition `n % i == 0` is evaluated.
Since `n` is not divisible by `i`, the condition is false.
The `else` block is executed, and the function returns `x`, which is 33.
