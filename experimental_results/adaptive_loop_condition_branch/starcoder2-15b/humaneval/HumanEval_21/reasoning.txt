The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers that have been rescaled to be between 0 and 1.
To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9], we need to perform the following steps:
1. Find the minimum and maximum numbers in the input list: min_number = 2.0 and max_number = 49.9.
2. For each number x in the input list, calculate the rescaled value by subtracting min_number from x and dividing the result by the difference between max_number and min_number.
3. Return the list of rescaled values.
Therefore, the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9] is [0.0, 1.0].
