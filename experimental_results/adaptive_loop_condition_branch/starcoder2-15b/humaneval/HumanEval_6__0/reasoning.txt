The function `parse_nested_parens` is called with ( paren_string = "((()))" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 0.

The function returns a list containing the maximum depth of each group of parentheses in the input string. In this case, the input string has only one group of parentheses, so the function returns a list containing the maximum depth of that group, which is 3.
