The function `triangle_area` is called with ( a = 3, b = 4, c = 5 ).
The condition `a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The function calculates the semi-perimeter `s` as (3 + 4 + 5) / 2 = 6.
The function calculates the area `area` as (6 * (6 - 3) * (6 - 4) * (6 - 5)) ** 0.5 = 9 ** 0.5 = 3.
The function rounds the area to two decimal places using `round(area, 2)` and returns the rounded area, which is 3.0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `triangle_area(3, 4, 5)` is 3.0.
