The function find_max takes a list of words as input and returns the word with the highest length.
To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["play", "this", "game", "of","footbott"], we need to sort the list of words by length in descending order.
Therefore, the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["play", "this", "game", "of","footbott"] is "footbott".
