The function triples_sum_to_zero(l) takes a list of numbers([1, 2, 3, 7]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
The inner loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
The innermost loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, k in the innermost loop is 2.
    - numbers[i]=1: compare with 2, 3, 7:
        - When j = 1 (numbers[j]=2), the condition `numbers[i] + numbers[j] + numbers[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] + numbers[j] + numbers[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] + numbers[j] + numbers[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, k in the innermost loop is 3.
    - numbers[i]=2: compare with 3, 7:
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] + numbers[j] + numbers[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] + numbers[j] + numbers[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, k in the innermost loop is 3.
    - numbers[i]=3: compare with 7:
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] + numbers[j] + numbers[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 3, k in the innermost loop is 3.
    - numbers[i]=7: compare with 7:
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] + numbers[j] + numbers[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
