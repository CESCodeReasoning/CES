The function `digits` is called with ( n = 5576543 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '5' is not odd, so product remains 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '5' is not odd, so product remains 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '7' is odd, so product becomes 7.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '6' is not odd, so product remains 7.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '5' is not odd, so product remains 7.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '4' is not odd, so product remains 7.
Iteration 7:
    -The character '3' is odd, so product becomes 21.

Since odd_count is not 0, the function returns the value of product, which is 21.
