The function sort_third takes a list l as input and returns a sorted version of l.
The function sorts every third element of l in ascending order.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10], we need to sort every third element of the list in ascending order.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_third on the input [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10] is [-12, 8, 5, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10].
