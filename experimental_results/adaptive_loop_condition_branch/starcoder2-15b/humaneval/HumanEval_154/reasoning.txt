The function cycpattern_check(a, b) takes two strings a and b as its parameters.
The function returns True if the pattern b is found in the string a, otherwise it returns False.
The function first checks if the length of the pattern b is greater than or equal to the length of the string a. If it is, then the pattern cannot be found in the string, so the function returns False.
The function then creates a new string pat by concatenating the pattern b with itself.
The function then iterates through all possible starting indices i of the pattern in the string a. For each starting index i, the function iterates through all possible starting indices j of the pattern in the concatenated string pat.
For each starting index i and j, the function checks if the substring of a starting at index i and of length l is equal to the substring of pat starting at index j and of length l. If it is, then the pattern is found in the string a, so the function returns True.
If the function reaches the end of the loop without finding the pattern, it returns False.
