The function `intersection` is called with ( interval1 = [-2, -2] ) and ( interval2 = [-3, -2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the maximum of the first elements of the two intervals, which is -2.
A variable `r` is initialized to the minimum of the second elements of the two intervals, which is -2.
A variable `length` is initialized to the difference between `r` and `l`, which is 0.
The function `is_prime` is called with ( num = 0 ).
The function `is_prime` checks if the number is 1 or 0, which is false.
The function `is_prime` checks if the number is 2, which is true.
The function `is_prime` returns True.
The condition ( length > 0 and is_prime(length) ) is false, so the function returns "NO".
