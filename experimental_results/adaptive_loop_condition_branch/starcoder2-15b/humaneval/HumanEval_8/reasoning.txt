The function `sum_product` is called with (numbers = [1,1,1]).
Inside the function, a variable `sum_value` is initialized to 0.
A variable `prod_value` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates through the list of numbers, which is [1,1,1].

First Iteration(n = 1):
    sum_value = 0 + 1 = 1
    prod_value = 1 * 1 = 1
Second Iteration(n = 1):
    sum_value = 1 + 1 = 2
    prod_value = 1 * 1 = 1
Third Iteration(n = 1):
    sum_value = 2 + 1 = 3
    prod_value = 1 * 1 = 1

After the loop completes, the function returns a tuple containing the sum and product of the numbers, which are 3 and 1 respectively.
