The function `change_base` is called with ( x = 8, base = 3 ).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to an empty string.
First Iteration:
    - x = 8, x % base = 2, ret = "2" + "" = "2".
    - x //= base updates x to 2 ( 8 // 3 = 2 ).
Second Iteration:
    - x = 2, x % base = 2, ret = "2" + "2" = "22".
    - x //= base updates x to 0 ( 2 // 3 = 0 ).
x is now 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `ret`, which is now "22".
