The function same_chars takes two strings s0 and s1 as input and returns True if the sets of characters in s0 and s1 are equal, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function same_chars on the input 'eabcdzzzz' and 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc', we need to compare the sets of characters in these strings.
The set of characters in 'eabcdzzzz' is {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'z'}, and the set of characters in 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc' is {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'z'}.
Since these sets are equal, the output of executing the function same_chars on the input 'eabcdzzzz' and 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc' is True.
