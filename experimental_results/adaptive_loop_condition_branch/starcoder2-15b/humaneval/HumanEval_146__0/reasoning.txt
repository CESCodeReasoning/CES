The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is not greater than 10, so the condition `num > 10` is false.
    -The `else` block is executed, and `count` remains 0.

The function returns the value of `count`, which is 0.
