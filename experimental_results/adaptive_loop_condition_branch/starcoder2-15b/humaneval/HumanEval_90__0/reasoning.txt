The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input and returns the second smallest element in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [5, 1, 4, 3, 2], we need to sort the list and return the second element.
Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [5, 1, 4, 3, 2] is 2.
