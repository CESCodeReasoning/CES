The function `fix_spaces` is called with ( text = "Exa   mple" ).
Inside the function, a variable `new_text` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates from 0 through 9 (since ( len(text) = 9 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - i < 9 when i=0
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 2` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "E".
    - `start, end = i + 1, i + 1` updates `start` to 1 and `end` to 1.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - i < 9 when i=1
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 2` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Ex".
    - `start, end = i + 1, i + 1` updates `start` to 2 and `end` to 2.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - i < 9 when i=2
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 2` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Exa".
    - `start, end = i + 1, i + 1` updates `start` to 3 and `end` to 3.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - i < 9 when i=3
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 4.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - i < 9 when i=4
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 5.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - i < 9 when i=5
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 6.
Seventh Iteration (i = 6):
    - i < 9 when i=6
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 2` is true. The second branch is taken.
    - `new_text += "-" + text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Exa-m".
    - `start, end = i + 1, i + 1` updates `start` to 7 and `end` to 7.
Eighth Iteration (i = 7):
    - i < 9 when i=7
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 2` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Exa-mp".
    - `start, end = i + 1, i + 1` updates `start` to 8 and `end` to 8.
Ninth Iteration (i = 8):
    - i < 9 when i=8
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 2` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Exa-mpl".
    - `start, end = i + 1, i + 1` updates `start` to 9 and `end` to 9.
Tenth Iteration (i = 9):
    - i < 9 when i=9
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `end - start > 2` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Exa-mple".
    - `start, end = i + 1, i + 1` updates `start` to 10 and `end` to 10.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `new_text`, which is now "Exa-mple".
