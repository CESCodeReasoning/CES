The function sort_array takes an array arr as input and returns a sorted array.
The sorting is done in two steps:
1. Sort the array arr using the built-in sorted function.
2. Sort the array again using the built-in sorted function, but this time the sorting is done based on the number of ones in the binary representation of each element.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4], we need to sort the array [1,5,2,3,4] using the built-in sorted function and then sort the resulting array again using the built-in sorted function, but this time the sorting is done based on the number of ones in the binary representation of each element.
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4] is [1,2,3,4,5].
