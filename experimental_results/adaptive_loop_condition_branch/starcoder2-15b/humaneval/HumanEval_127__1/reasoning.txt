The function `intersection` is called with ( interval1 = [-1, 1] ) and ( interval2 = [0, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the maximum of interval1[0] and interval2[0], which is 0.
A variable `r` is initialized to the minimum of interval1[1] and interval2[1], which is 1.
A variable `length` is initialized to the difference between `r` and `l`, which is 1.
The function `is_prime` is called with ( num = 1 ).
Inside the function, the condition `num == 1 or num == 0` is evaluated. Since `num` is 1, the condition is true.
The function returns False.
The condition `length > 0 and is_prime(length)` is evaluated. Since `length` is 1 and `is_prime(length)` is False, the condition is false.
The function returns "NO".
