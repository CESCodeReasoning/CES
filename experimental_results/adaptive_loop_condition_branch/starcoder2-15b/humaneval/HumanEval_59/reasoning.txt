The function `largest_prime_factor` is called with ( n = 15 ).
Inside the function, a variable `largest` is initialized to 1.

Iteration 1:
    -The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is true for j = 3.
    -The condition `n % j == 0` is true because 15 % 3 == 0.
    -The condition `is_prime(j)` is true because 3 is a prime number.
    -The value of `largest` is updated to 3.
Iteration 2:
    -The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is true for j = 5.
    -The condition `n % j == 0` is true because 15 % 5 == 0.
    -The condition `is_prime(j)` is true because 5 is a prime number.
    -The value of `largest` is updated to 5.
Iteration 3:
    -The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false for j = 6.
    -The condition `n % j == 0` is true because 15 % 6 == 0.
    -The condition `is_prime(j)` is false because 6 is not a prime number.
Iteration 4:
    -The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false for j = 7.
    -The condition `n % j == 0` is true because 15 % 7 == 0.
    -The condition `is_prime(j)` is false because 7 is not a prime number.
Iteration 5:
    -The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false for j = 8.
    -The condition `n % j == 0` is true because 15 % 8 == 0.
    -The condition `is_prime(j)` is false because 8 is not a prime number.
Iteration 6:
    -The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false for j = 9.
    -The condition `n % j == 0` is true because 15 % 9 == 0.
    -The condition `is_prime(j)` is false because 9 is not a prime number.
Iteration 7:
    -The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false for j = 10.
    -The condition `n % j == 0` is true because 15 % 10 == 0.
    -The condition `is_prime(j)` is false because 10 is not a prime number.
Iteration 8:
    -The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false for j = 11.
    -The condition `n % j == 0` is true because 15 % 11 == 0.
    -The condition `is_prime(j)` is false because 11 is not a prime number.
Iteration 9:
    -The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false for j = 12.
    -The condition `n % j == 0` is true because 15 % 12 == 0.
    -The condition `is_prime(j)` is false because 12 is not a prime number.
Iteration 10:
    -The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false for j = 13.
    -The condition `n % j == 0` is true because 15 % 13 == 0.
    -The condition `is_prime(j)` is false because 13 is not a prime number.
Iteration 11:
    -The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false for j = 14.
    -The condition `n % j == 0` is true because 15 % 14 == 0.
    -The condition `is_prime(j)` is false because 14 is not a prime number.
Iteration 12:
    -The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is false for j = 15.
    -The condition `n % j == 0` is true because 15 % 15 == 0.
    -The condition `is_prime(j)` is false because 15 is not a prime number.
