The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 3 (since ( len(arr) // 2 = 4 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `arr[0]` is 1, which does not equal `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` (which is 6).
   - The condition `arr[i]!= arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` results in `ans = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `arr[1]` is 2, which does not equal `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` (which is 7).
   - The condition `arr[i]!= arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` updates `ans` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `arr[2]` is 3, which does not equal `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` (which is 4).
   - The condition `arr[i]!= arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` updates `ans` to 3 (`2 + 1 = 3`).
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `arr[3]` is 5, which does not equal `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` (which is 5).
   - The condition `arr[i]!= arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains unchanged at 3.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is now 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6])` is 3.
