The function `largest_divisor` is called with ( n = 3 ).
Inside the function, the loop iterates from n to 1 in reverse order (3, 2, 1).
Iteration 1:
    -The condition (3 % 3 == 0) is true, so the function returns 3.
Iteration 2:
    -The condition (3 % 2 == 0) is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 3:
    -The condition (3 % 1 == 0) is true, so the function returns 1.
