The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None.
A variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of the list is 1.
    -Since `running_max` is None, it is set to 1.
    -The element 1 is appended to the `result` list.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element of the list is 2.
    -Since `running_max` is not None, it is compared with 2 using the `max` function.
    -The maximum value of 2 and `running_max` is 2.
    -The element 2 is appended to the `result` list.
Iteration 3:
    -The third element of the list is 3.
    -Since `running_max` is not None, it is compared with 3 using the `max` function.
    -The maximum value of 3 and `running_max` is 3.
    -The element 3 is appended to the `result` list.
Iteration 4:
    -The fourth and last element of the list is 4.
    -Since `running_max` is not None, it is compared with 4 using the `max` function.
    -The maximum value of 4 and `running_max` is 4.
    -The element 4 is appended to the `result` list.

The function returns the `result` list, which contains the running maximum values of the input list.
