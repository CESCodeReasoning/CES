The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['1234567']).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`.

First Iteration (arr = '1234567'):
    The `sum` function is called with a generator expression.
    The generator expression iterates over each character in the string `arr`.
    For each character, the expression `int(d)%2==1` is evaluated.
    If the character is an odd number, the expression evaluates to True, and 1 is added to the sum.
    If the character is an even number, the expression evaluates to False, and 0 is added to the sum.
    The sum of the odd numbers in the string is calculated and stored in the variable `n`.
    The string "the number of odd elements n the strnng n of the nput." is concatenated with the value of `n` using the `str` function.
    The resulting string is appended to the list `res`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the list `res`, which contains a single string with the number of odd elements in the input string.
