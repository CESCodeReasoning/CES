The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The function creates a list A of integers from 1 to n, where each element is the square of its index minus the index plus 1.
The function then creates an empty list ans to store the triples that satisfy the condition.
The function then iterates through the elements of A using three nested loops.
The first loop iterates through the elements of A from index 0 to n-1.
The second loop iterates through the elements of A from index i+1 to n-1.
The third loop iterates through the elements of A from index j+1 to n-1.
For each triple of elements (A[i], A[j], A[k]) that satisfy the condition (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0, the function appends the triple to the list ans.
The function then returns the length of the list ans.
