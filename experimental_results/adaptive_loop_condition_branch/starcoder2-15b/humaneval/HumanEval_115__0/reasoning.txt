The function max_fill takes two arguments: grid, which is a 2D array of integers, and capacity, which is an integer.
The function returns the maximum number of fills that can be made in the grid, where each fill is a contiguous block of 1s with a capacity of at most capacity.

To determine the output of executing the function max_fill on the input [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2, we need to understand the logic of the function.

The function first calculates the sum of each row in the grid using the sum function.
Then, it divides each sum by capacity using the / operator.
Finally, it rounds each division up using the math.ceil function.
The sum of these rounded divisions is the maximum number of fills that can be made in the grid.

Therefore, the output of executing the function max_fill on the input [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2 is 5.
