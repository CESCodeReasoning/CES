The function `fib4` is called with ( n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `results` is initialized to [0, 0, 2, 0].
The condition ( n < 4 ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The loop iterates from 4 through 5 (since ( n + 1 = 6 )).
First Iteration (_ = 4):
    results[-1] = 0, results[-2] = 0, results[-3] = 2, results[-4] = 0, results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates results to [0, 0, 2, 0, 2], results.pop(0) removes the first element from results, which is 0, leaving results as [0, 2, 0, 2].
Second Iteration (_ = 5):
    results[-1] = 2, results[-2] = 0, results[-3] = 2, results[-4] = 0, results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates results to [0, 2, 0, 2, 4], results.pop(0) removes the first element from results, which is 0, leaving results as [2, 0, 2, 4].
After the loop completes, the function returns the last element of results, which is 4.
