The function `is_prime` is called with ( n = 6 ).
Inside the function, the condition `n < 2` is evaluated.
Since `n` is 6, which is greater than or equal to 2, the condition is false.
The loop iterates from 2 through 5 (since ( n - 1 = 5 )).
First Iteration (k = 2)
   - `n` is 6, which is divisible by 2 (6 % 2 = 0).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is true.
   - Action: The function returns False.
Second Iteration (k = 3)
   - `n` is 6, which is divisible by 3 (6 % 3 = 0).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is true.
   - Action: The function returns False.
Third Iteration (k = 4)
   - `n` is 6, which is divisible by 4 (6 % 4 = 2).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
Fourth Iteration (k = 5)
   - `n` is 6, which is divisible by 5 (6 % 5 = 1).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
Fifth Iteration (k = 6)
   - `n` is 6, which is divisible by 6 (6 % 6 = 0).
   - The condition `n % k == 0` is true.
   - Action: The function returns False.

Since the function returns False in any of the iterations, the final output of the function `is_prime(6)` is False.
