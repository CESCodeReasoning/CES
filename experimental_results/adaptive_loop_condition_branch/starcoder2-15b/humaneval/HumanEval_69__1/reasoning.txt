The function `search` is called with ( lst = [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] ).
Inside the function, a variable `frq` is initialized to a list of 0s with a length equal to the maximum value in the list plus 1.

Iteration 1:
    -The value of `i` is 8, which is the first element in the list.
    -The frequency of 8 in the list is 8, which is greater than or equal to 8.
    -The value of `ans` is updated to 8.
Iteration 2:
    -The value of `i` is 8, which is the second element in the list.
    -The frequency of 8 in the list is 8, which is greater than or equal to 8.
    -The value of `ans` is updated to 8.
Iteration 3:
    -The value of `i` is 8, which is the third element in the list.
    -The frequency of 8 in the list is 8, which is greater than or equal to 8.
    -The value of `ans` is updated to 8.
Iteration 4:
    -The value of `i` is 8, which is the fourth element in the list.
    -The frequency of 8 in the list is 8, which is greater than or equal to 8.
    -The value of `ans` is updated to 8.
Iteration 5:
    -The value of `i` is 8, which is the fifth element in the list.
    -The frequency of 8 in the list is 8, which is greater than or equal to 8.
    -The value of `ans` is updated to 8.
Iteration 6:
    -The value of `i` is 8, which is the sixth element in the list.
    -The frequency of 8 in the list is 8, which is greater than or equal to 8.
    -The value of `ans` is updated to 8.
Iteration 7:
    -The value of `i` is 8, which is the seventh element in the list.
    -The frequency of 8 in the list is 8, which is greater than or equal to 8.
    -The value of `ans` is updated to 8.
Iteration 8:
    -The value of `i` is 8, which is the eighth element in the list.
    -The frequency of 8 in the list is 8, which is greater than or equal to 8.
    -The value of `ans` is updated to 8.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is 8.
