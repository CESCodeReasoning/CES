The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = "Hello" ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the length of the string, which is 5.

The first conditional statement checks if the length of the string is 0 or 1. Since the length is 5, the condition is false and the function continues to the next statement.

The second for loop iterates from 2 to 4 (since the length of the string is 5).

Iteration 1:
    -The condition `l % i == 0` is false, since 5 % 2 is not equal to 0.
Iteration 2:
    -The condition `l % i == 0` is false, since 5 % 3 is not equal to 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The condition `l % i == 0` is false, since 5 % 4 is not equal to 0.

Since none of the iterations of the for loop return True, the function returns False.
