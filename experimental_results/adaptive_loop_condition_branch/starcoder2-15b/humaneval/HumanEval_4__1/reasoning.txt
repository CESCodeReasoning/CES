The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function mean_absolute_deviation on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], we need to calculate the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list.
The mean of the numbers in the list is 3.0.
The mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list is the sum of the absolute differences between each number and the mean, divided by the number of numbers in the list.
Therefore, the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list is (abs(1.0 - 3.0) + abs(2.0 - 3.0) + abs(3.0 - 3.0) + abs(4.0 - 3.0) + abs(5.0 - 3.0)) / 5 = (2.0 + 1.0 + 0.0 + 1.0 + 2.0) / 5 = 1.0.
