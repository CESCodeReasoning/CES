The function `encrypt` is called with ( s = 'et' ).
Inside the function, a variable `d` is initialized to 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
The variable `out` is initialized to an empty string.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'e' is in d, so the condition is true.
    -The index of 'e' in d is 4.
    -The index of the new character in d is (4 + 2 * 2) % 26 = 12.
    -The new character is'm'.
    -The new string is'm'.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 't' is in d, so the condition is true.
    -The index of 't' in d is 19.
    -The index of the new character in d is (19 + 2 * 2) % 26 = 25.
    -The new character is 'z'.
    -The new string is'mz'.
