The function `monotonic` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 4, 20] ).
`l` is [1, 2, 4, 20], which is not equal to `sorted(l)` or `sorted(l, reverse=True)`.
The condition `l == sorted(l) or l == sorted(l, reverse=True)` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken and the method returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])` is False.
