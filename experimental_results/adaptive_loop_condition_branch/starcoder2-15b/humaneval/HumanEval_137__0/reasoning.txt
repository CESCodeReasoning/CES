The function `compare_one` is called with ( a = 5, b = 6 ).
Inside the function, the variables `temp_a` and `temp_b` are initialized to the values of `a` and `b`, respectively.
The first condition checks if `temp_a` is an instance of the `str` class. Since `temp_a` is an integer, the condition is false and the `if` branch is not taken.
The second condition checks if `temp_b` is an instance of the `str` class. Since `temp_b` is an integer, the condition is false and the `if` branch is not taken.
The third condition checks if the float value of `temp_a` is equal to the float value of `temp_b`. Since `temp_a` and `temp_b` are both integers, the float values are the same. The condition is true and the `if` branch is taken.
The `if` branch returns `None`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one(5, 6)` is `None`.
