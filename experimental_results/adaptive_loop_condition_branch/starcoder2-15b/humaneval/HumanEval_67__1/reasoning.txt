The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "5 apples and 6 oranges", n = 21 ).
Inside the function, a variable `lis` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '5' is a digit, so it is appended to the list `lis`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '6' is a digit, so it is appended to the list `lis`.

The function returns the difference between `n` and the sum of the integers in `lis`.
