The function remove_vowels takes a string text as input and returns a new string that contains all the consonants from the input string.
To determine the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input "ybcd", we need to iterate over each character in the input string and check if it is a vowel. If it is not a vowel, we add it to the output string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input "ybcd" is "ybcd".
