The function add takes a list lst as input and returns the sum of the elements at even-numbered indices in lst that are even.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88], we need to consider the elements at even-numbered indices in the list [4, 88].
The elements at even-numbered indices are 88.
Only 88 is even, so we add it to the sum.
Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88] is 88.
