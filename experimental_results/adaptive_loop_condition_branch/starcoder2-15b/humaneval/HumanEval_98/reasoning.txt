The function `count_upper` is called with ( s = 'aBCdEf' ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through the length of the string `s` (6), with a step size of 2.
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `s[i]` is 'a', which is not in "AEIOU".
   - The condition `s[i] in "AEIOU"` is false.
   - Action: `count` remains unchanged.
Second Iteration (i = 2)
   - `s[i]` is 'C', which is not in "AEIOU".
   - The condition `s[i] in "AEIOU"` is false.
   - Action: `count` remains unchanged.
Third Iteration (i = 4)
   - `s[i]` is 'E', which is in "AEIOU".
   - The condition `s[i] in "AEIOU"` is true.
   - Action: `count += 1` updates `count` to 1 (`0 + 1 = 1`).
Fourth Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is 6, which is out of the range of the string `s`.
   - The loop terminates.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `count`, which is now 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `count_upper('aBCdEf')` is 1.
