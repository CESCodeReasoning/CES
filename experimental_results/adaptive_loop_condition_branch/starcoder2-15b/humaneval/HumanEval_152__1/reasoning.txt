The function compare takes two lists game and guess as input and returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input [0,0,0,0,0,0] and [0,0,0,0,0,0], we need to calculate the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists.
Since all elements of both lists are equal, the absolute differences between corresponding elements will be 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input [0,0,0,0,0,0] and [0,0,0,0,0,0] is [0,0,0,0,0,0].
