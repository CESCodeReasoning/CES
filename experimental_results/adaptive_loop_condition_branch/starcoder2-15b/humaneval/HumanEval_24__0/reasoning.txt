The function `largest_divisor` is called with ( n = 49 ).
Inside the function, the loop iterates from 48 to 0 in reverse order.

Iteration 1:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.

    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 17:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 18:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 19:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 20:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 21:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 22:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 23:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 24:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.

Iteration 27:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 28:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 29:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 30:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 31:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 32:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 33:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 34:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 35:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 36:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 37:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 38:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 39:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 40:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 41:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 42:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 43:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 44:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 45:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 46:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 47:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is false, so the loop continues.
Iteration 48:
    -The condition `n % i == 0` is true, so the loop breaks.

The loop breaks when the condition `n % i == 0` is true, which means that `i` is a divisor of `n`.
The function returns the value of `i`, which is the largest divisor of `n`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `largest_divisor(49)` is 7.
