The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 144, b = 60 ).
Inside the function, the while loop iterates until b is 0.
First Iteration:
    - b = 60, a = 144, b = 60, a % b = 0.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 60 and b to 0.
Second Iteration:
    - b = 0, the while loop terminates.
The function returns the value of a, which is now 60.
