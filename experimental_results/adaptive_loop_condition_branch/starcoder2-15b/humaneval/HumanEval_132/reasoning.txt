The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = '[[]]' ).
Inside the function, a variable `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` are initialized to empty lists.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '[' is found at index 0, so opening_bracket_index becomes [0].
Iteration 2:
    -The character '[' is found at index 1, so opening_bracket_index becomes [0, 1].
Iteration 3:
    -The character ']' is found at index 2, so closing_bracket_index becomes [2].
Iteration 4:
    -The character ']' is found at index 3, so closing_bracket_index becomes [2, 3].

The closing_bracket_index list is reversed to [3, 2].

The loop iterates over the opening_bracket_index list.

Iteration 1:
    -The first opening bracket at index 0 is compared with the first closing bracket at index 3.
    -Since 0 < 3, cnt becomes 1 and i becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second opening bracket at index 1 is compared with the second closing bracket at index 2.
    -Since 1 < 2, cnt becomes 2 and i becomes 2.

Since cnt is greater than or equal to 2, the function returns True.
