The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 33, y = 12354 ).
`x` is 33, which is not greater than `y` ( 33 <= 12354 ).
The condition `x > y` is false, therefore the first if branch is not taken.
`y` is 12354, which is evenly divisible by 2 ( 12354 % 2 == 0 ).
The condition `y % 2 == 0` is true, therefore the second if branch is taken and the method returns 12354.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(33, 12354)` is 12354.
