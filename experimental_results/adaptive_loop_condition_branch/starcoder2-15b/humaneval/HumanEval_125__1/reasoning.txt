The function `split_words` is called with ( txt = "Hello world,!" ).
`txt` contains a comma (","), which satisfies ( "," in txt ).
The condition ( "," in txt ) is True.
The first branch is taken.

The function returns the result of calling the `split` method on `txt` with no arguments.
The `split` method splits the string into a list of words, using the space character (" ") as the delimiter.

Therefore, the final output of the function `split_words("Hello world,!")` is a list of words: ["Hello", "world", "!"].
