The function `by_length` is called with (arr = []).
Inside the function, a variable `dic` is initialized to a dictionary with keys 1 to 9 and values "One" to "Nine".
A variable `sorted_arr` is initialized to the sorted version of `arr` in descending order.
A variable `new_arr` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates through each element in `sorted_arr`.

First Iteration(var = 1):
    The try block tries to append the value of `dic[var]` to `new_arr`.
    Since `var` is 1, `dic[var]` is "One".
    The append operation adds "One" to `new_arr`.
Second Iteration(var = 2):
    The try block tries to append the value of `dic[var]` to `new_arr`.
    Since `var` is 2, `dic[var]` is "Two".
    The append operation adds "Two" to `new_arr`.
Third Iteration(var = 3):
    The try block tries to append the value of `dic[var]` to `new_arr`.
    Since `var` is 3, `dic[var]` is "Three".
    The append operation adds "Three" to `new_arr`.
Fourth Iteration(var = 4):
    The try block tries to append the value of `dic[var]` to `new_arr`.
    Since `var` is 4, `dic[var]` is "Four".
    The append operation adds "Four" to `new_arr`.
Fifth Iteration(var = 5):
    The try block tries to append the value of `dic[var]` to `new_arr`.
    Since `var` is 5, `dic[var]` is "Five".
    The append operation adds "Five" to `new_arr`.
Sixth Iteration(var = 6):
    The try block tries to append the value of `dic[var]` to `new_arr`.
    Since `var` is 6, `dic[var]` is "Six".
    The append operation adds "Six" to `new_arr`.
Seventh Iteration(var = 7):
    The try block tries to append the value of `dic[var]` to `new_arr`.
    Since `var` is 7, `dic[var]` is "Seven".
    The append operation adds "Seven" to `new_arr`.
Eighth Iteration(var = 8):
    The try block tries to append the value of `dic[var]` to `new_arr`.
    Since `var` is 8, `dic[var]` is "Eight".
    The append operation adds "Eight" to `new_arr`.
Ninth Iteration(var = 9):
    The try block tries to append the value of `dic[var]` to `new_arr`.
    Since `var` is 9, `dic[var]` is "Nine".
    The append operation adds "Nine" to `new_arr`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `new_arr`, which is now ["Nine", "Eight", "Seven", "Six", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "One"].
