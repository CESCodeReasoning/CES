The function `change_base` is called with ( x = 9, base = 3 ).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to an empty string.
First Iteration:
    - x = 9, x > 0 is True.
    - x % base = 0, ret = "0" + ret = "0".
    - x //= base updates x to 3 ( 9 // 3 = 3 ).
Second Iteration:
    - x = 3, x > 0 is True.
    - x % base = 0, ret = "0" + ret = "00".
    - x //= base updates x to 1 ( 3 // 3 = 1 ).
Third Iteration:
    - x = 1, x > 0 is True.
    - x % base = 1, ret = "1" + ret = "100".
    - x //= base updates x to 0 ( 1 // 3 = 0 ).
x is now 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `ret`, which is now "100".
