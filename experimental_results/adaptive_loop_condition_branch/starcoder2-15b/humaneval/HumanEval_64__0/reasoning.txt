The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "bYe" ).
The variable `vowels` is initialized to the string "aeiouAEIOU".
The variable `n_vowels` is initialized to the sum of the number of characters in `s` that are in `vowels`.
In this case, the sum is 2, since there are 2 vowels in the string "bYe" ('e' and 'e').
The last character of `s` is 'e', which is not 'y' or 'Y'.
The condition `s[-1] == 'y' or s[-1] == 'Y'` is false.
The `else` branch is taken, and the function returns the value of `n_vowels`, which is 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("bYe")` is 2.
