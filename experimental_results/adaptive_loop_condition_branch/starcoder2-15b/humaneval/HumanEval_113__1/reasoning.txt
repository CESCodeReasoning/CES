The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['271', '137', '314']).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`.

First Iteration (arr = '271'):
    The `sum` function is called with a generator expression that calculates the sum of the number of odd digits in the string '271'.
    The generator expression iterates over each digit in the string '271' and checks if the digit is odd by checking if the remainder of the digit divided by 2 is 1.
    The `sum` function returns the sum of the number of odd digits in the string '271', which is 2.
    The string 'the number of odd elements 2n the str2n the string 2 of the 2nput.' is appended to the list `res`.

Second Iteration (arr = '137'):
    The `sum` function is called with a generator expression that calculates the sum of the number of odd digits in the string '137'.
    The generator expression iterates over each digit in the string '137' and checks if the digit is odd by checking if the remainder of the digit divided by 2 is 1.
    The `sum` function returns the sum of the number of odd digits in the string '137', which is 3.
    The string 'the number of odd elements 3n the str3n the string 3 of the 3nput.' is appended to the list `res`.

Third Iteration (arr = '314'):
    The `sum` function is called with a generator expression that calculates the sum of the number of odd digits in the string '314'.
    The generator expression iterates over each digit in the string '314' and checks if the digit is odd by checking if the remainder of the digit divided by 2 is 1.
    The `sum` function returns the sum of the number of odd digits in the string '314', which is 1.
    The string 'the number of odd elements 1n the str1n the string 1 of the 1nput.' is appended to the list `res`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the list `res`, which contains the strings 'the number of odd elements 2n the str2n the string 2 of the 2nput.', 'the number of odd elements 3n the str3n the string 3 of the 3nput.', and 'the number of odd elements 1n the str1n the string 1 of the 1nput.'.
