The function `string_xor` is called with ( a = '1', b = '1' ).
Inside the function, the `xor` function is defined.
The `xor` function takes two arguments, `i` and `j`.
The `xor` function checks if `i` is equal to `j`.
If `i` is equal to `j`, the function returns '0'.
Otherwise, the function returns '1'.

The `string_xor` function calls the `xor` function for each pair of characters in `a` and `b` using the `zip` function.
The `zip` function creates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a character from `a` and a character from `b`.
The `xor` function is called for each tuple in the list, and the results are joined together to form a string.

In this case, the `string_xor` function is called with ( a = '1', b = '1' ).
