The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['()(', ')'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `S1` is initialized to '()(' + ')'.
A variable `S2` is initialized to ')(' + '()'.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is in S1, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is in S1, so val becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ')' is in S1, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '(' is in S2, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ')' is in S2, so val becomes 0.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '(' is in S2, so val becomes 1.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ')' is in S2, so val becomes 0.

Since val is 0 in both S1 and S2, the function returns 'Yes'.
