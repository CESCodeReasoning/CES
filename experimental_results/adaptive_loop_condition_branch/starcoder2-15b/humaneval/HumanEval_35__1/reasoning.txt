The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [3, 2, -3.5, 0] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list `l`, which is 3.

Iteration 1:
    -The element 2 is not greater than m, so m remains 3.
Iteration 2:
    -The element -3.5 is not greater than m, so m remains 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The element 0 is not greater than m, so m remains 3.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `m`, which is 3.
