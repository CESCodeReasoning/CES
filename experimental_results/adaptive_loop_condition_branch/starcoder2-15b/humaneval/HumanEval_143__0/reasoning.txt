The function words_in_sentence(sentence) takes a string sentence as its parameter.
The function splits the sentence into a list of words using the split() method.
The function then iterates through each word in the list.
For each word, the function checks if the length of the word is 1. If it is, the function sets the flag flg to 1.
The function then iterates through the range from 2 to the length of the word.
For each value of i, the function checks if the length of the word is divisible by i. If it is, the function sets the flag flg to 1.
The function then checks if the flag flg is 0 or the length of the word is 2. If it is, the function appends the word to the new_lst list.
Finally, the function returns the new_lst list joined by a space.
