The function `string_xor` is called with ( a = '111000', b = '101010' ).
Inside the function, the `xor` function is defined.
The `xor` function takes two arguments, `i` and `j`.
If `i` and `j` are equal, the function returns '0'.
Otherwise, it returns '1'.
The `string_xor` function returns a string formed by concatenating the result of calling the `xor` function on each pair of characters from `a` and `b`.

In this case, the `string_xor` function is called with ( a = '111000', b = '101010' ).
The `xor` function is called on each pair of characters from `a` and `b`, and the results are concatenated to form the final string.

The first pair of characters is ('1', '1'). Since they are equal, the `xor` function returns '0'.
The second pair of characters is ('1', '0'). Since they are not equal, the `xor` function returns '1'.
The third pair of characters is ('1', '1'). Since they are equal, the `xor` function returns '0'.
The fourth pair of characters is ('0', '0'). Since they are equal, the `xor` function returns '0'.
The fifth pair of characters is ('0', '1'). Since they are not equal, the `xor` function returns '1'.
The sixth pair of characters is ('0', '0'). Since they are equal, the `xor` function returns '0'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `string_xor('111000', '101010')` is '010010'.
