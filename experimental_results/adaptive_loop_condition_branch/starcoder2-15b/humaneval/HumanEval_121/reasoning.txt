The function solution takes a list of integers lst as input and returns the sum of all the odd numbers at even indices in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [5, 8, 7, 1], we need to find the odd numbers at even indices in the list.
The odd numbers at even indices in the list are 5 and 7.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [5, 8, 7, 1] is 12.
