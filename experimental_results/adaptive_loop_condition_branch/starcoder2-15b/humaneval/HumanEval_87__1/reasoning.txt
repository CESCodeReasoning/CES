The function get_row takes a list of lists lst and an integer x as input and returns a list of tuples representing the coordinates of the elements in lst that are equal to x.
To determine the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3, we need to find the coordinates of the elements in the list [[], [1], [1, 2, 3]] that are equal to 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function get_row on the input [[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3 is [(2, 2)].
