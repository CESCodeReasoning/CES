The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [1,2,3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The condition `i %3 == 0` is true, so the value of `lst[i]**2` is appended to the `result` list.
    -The value of `lst[i]**2` is 1, so the `result` list becomes [1].
Iteration 2:
    -The condition `i %3 == 0` is false, so the condition `i % 4 == 0 and i%3!= 0` is evaluated.
    -The condition `i % 4 == 0` is false, so the condition `i%3!= 0` is evaluated.
    -The condition `i%3!= 0` is true, so the value of `lst[i]` is appended to the `result` list.
    -The value of `lst[i]` is 2, so the `result` list becomes [1, 2].
Iteration 3:
    -The condition `i %3 == 0` is true, so the value of `lst[i]**3` is appended to the `result` list.
    -The value of `lst[i]**3` is 27, so the `result` list becomes [1, 2, 27].

After the loop completes, the function returns the sum of the `result` list, which is 28.
