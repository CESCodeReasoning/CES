The function `is_sorted` is called with ( lst = [3, 2, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count_digit` is initialized to a dictionary with keys as the elements of `lst` and values as 0.
The loop iterates through the elements of `lst` (i.e., 3, 2, and 1).
For each element, the value of the corresponding key in `count_digit` is incremented by 1.
After the loop completes, `count_digit` becomes {3: 1, 2: 1, 1: 1}.
The condition (any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst)) is evaluated to False, since no element in `lst` has a count greater than 2.
The condition (all(lst[i - 1] <= lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst)))) is evaluated to False, since the elements of `lst` are not in ascending order.
Therefore, the else branch is taken and the function returns False as the output.
