The function `strange_sort_list` is called with ( lst = []).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates until lst is empty.
First Iteration:
    - lst = [], min(lst) = None, max(lst) = None.
    - res.append(min(lst) if switch else max(lst)) appends None to res.
    - lst.remove(res[-1]) removes None from lst.
    - switch = not switch updates switch to False.
lst is empty, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `res`, which is now [].
