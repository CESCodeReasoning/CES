The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1, 4, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 1 (since ( len(arr) // 2 = 1 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `arr[i]` is 1, which is not equal to `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` (which is 2).
   - The condition `arr[i]!= arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` results in `ans = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `arr[i]` is 4, which is not equal to `arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` (which is 1).
   - The condition `arr[i]!= arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans += 1` updates `ans` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is now 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1, 4, 2])` is 2.
