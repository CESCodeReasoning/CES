The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "5 apples and 6 oranges", n = 19 ).
Inside the function, a variable `lis` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates over the words in the string `s` using the `split()` method.
First Iteration (i = "5")
   - `i` is a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is true.
   - Action: `lis.append(int(i))` appends the integer value of `i` to the list `lis`.
Second Iteration (i = "apples")
   - `i` is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
Third Iteration (i = "and")
   - `i` is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
Fourth Iteration (i = "6")
   - `i` is a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is true.
   - Action: `lis.append(int(i))` appends the integer value of `i` to the list `lis`.
Fifth Iteration (i = "oranges")
   - `i` is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - Action: The loop continues to the next iteration.
After the loop completes, the function returns the difference between `n` and the sum of the integers in the list `lis`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19)` is 8.
