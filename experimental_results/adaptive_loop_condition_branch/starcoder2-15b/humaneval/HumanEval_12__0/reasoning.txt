The function `longest` is called with ( strings = ['x', 'y', 'z'] ).
Inside the function, the condition `not strings` is evaluated.
Since `strings` is not empty, the condition is false.
The `if` block is skipped.

The variable `maxlen` is assigned the value of the maximum length of the strings in `strings`.
In this case, the maximum length is 1.

The loop iterates over each string in `strings`.
The first iteration:
    - The string 'x' has a length of 1, which is equal to `maxlen`.
    - The `if` block is executed and the function returns 'x'.

The function returns 'x' as the longest string in `strings`.
