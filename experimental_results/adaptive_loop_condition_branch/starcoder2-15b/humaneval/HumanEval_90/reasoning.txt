The function next_smallest takes a list of integers lst as input and returns the next smallest integer in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we need to sort the list and remove duplicates.
Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 2.
