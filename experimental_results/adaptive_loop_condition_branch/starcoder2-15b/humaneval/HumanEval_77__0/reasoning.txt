The function iscube takes an integer a as input and returns True if a is a cube number, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function iscube on the input 2, we need to check if 2 is a cube number.
We first take the absolute value of 2, which is 2.
Then, we calculate the cube root of 2 using the power operator (1. / 3), which is approximately 1.2599210498948732.
We round the cube root to the nearest integer using the round function, which is 1.
We then calculate the cube of 1 using the power operator (1 ** 3), which is 1.
Finally, we compare the cube of 1 to 2 using the equality operator (1 == 2), which is False.
Therefore, the output of executing the function iscube on the input 2 is False.
