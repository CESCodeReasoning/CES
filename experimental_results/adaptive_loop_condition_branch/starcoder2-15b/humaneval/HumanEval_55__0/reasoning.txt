The function `fib` is called with ( n = 12 ).
`n` is 12, which does not satisfy ( n == 0 ).
The condition `n == 0` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
`n` is 12, which does not satisfy ( n == 1 ).
The condition `n == 1` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The function calls itself recursively with ( n = 11 ) and ( n = 10 ).
