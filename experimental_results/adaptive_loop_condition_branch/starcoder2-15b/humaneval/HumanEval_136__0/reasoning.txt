The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer in the list.

In the case of an empty list, the function returns a tuple containing None for both the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer.

The function first filters the list to obtain two lists: one containing only the negative integers and the other containing only the positive integers.

If the filtered list of negative integers is not empty, the function returns the maximum value in the list as the largest negative integer. Otherwise, it returns None.

Similarly, if the filtered list of positive integers is not empty, the function returns the minimum value in the list as the smallest positive integer. Otherwise, it returns None.

In the case of an empty list, both the filtered lists of negative integers and positive integers will be empty, and the function will return a tuple containing None for both the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer.
