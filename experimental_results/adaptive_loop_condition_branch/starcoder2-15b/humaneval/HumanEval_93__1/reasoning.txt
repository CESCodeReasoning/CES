The function encode takes a string message as input and returns an encoded version of the message.
The function first creates a dictionary vowels_replace that maps each vowel to the character 2 positions ahead of it in the alphabet.
It then swaps the case of all the characters in the message and returns a new string where each vowel is replaced with the corresponding character in vowels_replace.

To determine the output of executing the function encode on the input "I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE", we need to perform the following steps:
1. Swap the case of all the characters in the message "I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE" to obtain "i dONt kNOw wHaT To wRITE".
2. Replace each vowel in the message with the corresponding character in vowels_replace.

Therefore, the output of executing the function encode on the input "I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE" is "i dONv kNOz wHbV To xVWE".
