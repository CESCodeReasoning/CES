The function `how_many_times` is called with ( string = "xyxyxyx", substring = "x" ).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through (len(string) - len(substring) + 1) (since ( len(string) = 7 ) and ( len(substring) = 1 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 <= i < 7 ).
   - The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is true.
   - Action: `times += 1` results in `times = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which still satisfies ( 0 <= i < 7 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which still satisfies ( 0 <= i < 7 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 3 (`2 + 1 = 3`).
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which still satisfies ( 0 <= i < 7 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 4 (`3 + 1 = 4`).
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which still satisfies ( 0 <= i < 7 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 5 (`4 + 1 = 5`).
Sixth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which still satisfies ( 0 <= i < 7 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 6 (`5 + 1 = 6`).
Seventh Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is 6, which still satisfies ( 0 <= i < 7 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `times += 1` updates `times` to 7 (`6 + 1 = 7`).
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `times`, which is now 7.

Therefore, the final output of the function `how_many_times("xyxyxyx", "x")` is 7.
