The function `intersection` is called with ( interval1 = [-2, -2], interval2 = [-3, -2] ).
Inside the function, a function `is_prime` is defined.
The function `is_prime` is called with ( num = 2 ).
The function `is_prime` returns True.
The variable `l` is initialized to the maximum of ( interval1[0] = -2 ) and ( interval2[0] = -3 ).
The variable `r` is initialized to the minimum of ( interval1[1] = -2 ) and ( interval2[1] = -2 ).
The variable `length` is initialized to the value of ( r - l ) = -4.
The condition ( length > 0 and is_prime(length) ) is evaluated.
The condition ( length > 0 ) is evaluated.
The condition ( is_prime(length) ) is evaluated.
The condition ( length > 0 ) is true.
The condition ( is_prime(length) ) is true.
The condition ( length > 0 and is_prime(length) ) is true.
The function `intersection` returns "YES".
