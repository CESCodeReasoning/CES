The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 12, shift = 1 ).
The variable `s` is initialized to the string representation of `x`, which is "12".
The condition `shift > len(s)` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns the reversed string of `s`, which is "21".

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(12, 1)` is "21".
