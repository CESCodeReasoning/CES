The function `by_length` is called with (arr = [1, -1, 3, 2]).
The variable `dic` is initialized to a dictionary.
The variable `sorted_arr` is initialized to the sorted version of `arr` in reverse order.
The variable `new_arr` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates through the sorted version of `arr` in reverse order.
First Iteration (var = 2):
    `dic[var]` = "Three"
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends "Three" to `new_arr`
Second Iteration (var = 3):
    `dic[var]` = "Four"
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends "Four" to `new_arr`
Third Iteration (var = 1):
    `dic[var]` = "Two"
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends "Two" to `new_arr`
Fourth Iteration (var = -1):
    `dic[var]` = "One"
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends "One" to `new_arr`
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `new_arr`, which is now ["Three", "Four", "Two", "One"].
