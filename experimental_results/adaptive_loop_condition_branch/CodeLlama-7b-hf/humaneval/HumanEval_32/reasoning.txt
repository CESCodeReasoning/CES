The function `find_zero` is called with ( xs = [-6, 11, -6, 1] ).
Inside the function, two variables `begin` and `end` are initialized to -1.0 and 1.0.
The loop iterates until the condition `poly(xs, begin) * poly(xs, end) > 0` is false.
The condition is true when `poly(xs, begin) * poly(xs, end) > 0` is true.
The condition is false when `poly(xs, begin) * poly(xs, end) > 0` is false.
The loop body is executed when the condition is true.
The loop body is not executed when the condition is false.
The loop body updates `begin` and `end` to values that satisfy the condition.
