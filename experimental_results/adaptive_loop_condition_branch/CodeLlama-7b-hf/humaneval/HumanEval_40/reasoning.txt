The function triples_sum_to_zero(l) takes a list of numbers([1, 3, 5, 0]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterats through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
In the innermost loop, for each element indexed by j in the inner loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
