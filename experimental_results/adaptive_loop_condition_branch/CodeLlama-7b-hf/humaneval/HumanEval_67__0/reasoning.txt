The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "2 apples and 3 oranges", n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `lis` is initialized to an empty list.
The string `s` is split into a list of strings, where each string is a word.

Iteration 1:
    -The string "2" is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
    -The action `lis.append(int(i))` is not executed.
Iteration 2:
    -The string "apples" is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
    -The action `lis.append(int(i))` is not executed.
Iteration 3:
    -The string "and" is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
    -The action `lis.append(int(i))` is not executed.
Iteration 4:
    -The string "3" is a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is true.
    -The action `lis.append(int(i))` is executed, resulting in `lis = [3]`.
Iteration 5:
    -The string "oranges" is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
    -The action `lis.append(int(i))` is not executed.

Therefore, the final value of `lis` is [3].
