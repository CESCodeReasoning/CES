The function `strange_sort_list` is called with ( lst = [] ).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
A variable `switch` is initialized to True.
The loop iterates while lst is not empty.
First Iteration:
    - lst = [], lst is empty.
    - The loop terminates.
The function returns the value of `res`, which is now [].
