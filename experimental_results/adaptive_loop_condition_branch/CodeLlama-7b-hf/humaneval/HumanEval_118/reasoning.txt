The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "yogurt" ).
Inside the function, a variable `vowels` is initialized to a set of vowels.
The condition `len(word) < 3` is evaluated.
   - Since the length of the word is 6, the condition is false.
   - Therefore, the `if` block is not executed.
   - The `else` block is executed.
   - The `else` block's action: `return ""` returns an empty string.
Therefore, the final output of the function `get_closest_vowel("yogurt")` is "".
