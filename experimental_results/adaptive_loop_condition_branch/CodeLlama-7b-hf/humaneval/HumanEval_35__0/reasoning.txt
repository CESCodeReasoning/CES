The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [-5, 2, 48, 9, 4, 0, 6, 7] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list, which is -5.
The loop iterates through the list.
First Iteration (e = -5)
   - The condition `e > m` is false.
   - Action: `m` remains -5.
Second Iteration (e = 2)
   - The condition `e > m` is true.
   - Action: `m` becomes 2.
Third Iteration (e = 48)
   - The condition `e > m` is true.
   - Action: `m` becomes 48.
Fourth Iteration (e = 9)
   - The condition `e > m` is true.
   - Action: `m` becomes 9.
Fifth Iteration (e = 4)
   - The condition `e > m` is false.
   - Action: `m` remains 9.
Sixth Iteration (e = 0)
   - The condition `e > m` is false.
   - Action: `m` remains 9.
Seventh Iteration (e = 6)
   - The condition `e > m` is true.
   - Action: `m` becomes 6.
Eighth Iteration (e = 7)
   - The condition `e > m` is true.
   - Action: `m` becomes 7.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `m`, which is 7.

Therefore, the final output of the function `max_element([-5, 2, 48, 9, 4, 0, 6, 7])` is 7.
