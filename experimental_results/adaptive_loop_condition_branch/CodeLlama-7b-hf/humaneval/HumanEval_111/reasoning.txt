The function `histogram` is called with ( test = "a b b a" ).
Inside the function, a variable `dict1` is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The variable `list1` is initialized to the list of words in the input string, split by spaces.
The variable `t` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'a' is in the list, so `list1.count(i)` is 1.
    -The condition `list1.count(i)>t` is true, so `t` is updated to 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'b' is in the list, so `list1.count(i)` is 2.
    -The condition `list1.count(i)>t` is true, so `t` is updated to 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'b' is in the list, so `list1.count(i)` is 2.
    -The condition `list1.count(i)>t` is true, so `t` is updated to 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'a' is in the list, so `list1.count(i)` is 1.
    -The condition `list1.count(i)>t` is true, so `t` is updated to 2.

After the loop, the variable `t` is 2.

The condition `t>0` is true, so the `if` block is executed.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'a' is in the list, so `list1.count(i)` is 1.
    -The condition `list1.count(i)==t` is true, so the `if` block is executed.
    -The condition `list1.count(i)==t` is true, so the `if` block is executed.
    -The condition `list1.count(i)==t` is true, so the `if` block is executed.
    -The condition `list1.count(i)==t` is true, so the `if` block is executed.
