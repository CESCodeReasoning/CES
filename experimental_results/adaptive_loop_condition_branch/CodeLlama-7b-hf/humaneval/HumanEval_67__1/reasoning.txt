The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "5 apples and 6 oranges", n = 21 ).
Inside the function, a variable `lis` is initialized to an empty list.
The string `s` is split into a list of strings using the space character as the delimiter.

Iteration 1:
    -The string '5' is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
    -The action `lis.append(int(i))` is not executed.
Iteration 2:
    -The string 'apples' is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
    -The action `lis.append(int(i))` is not executed.
Iteration 3:
    -The string 'and' is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
    -The action `lis.append(int(i))` is not executed.
Iteration 4:
    -The string '6' is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
    -The action `lis.append(int(i))` is not executed.
Iteration 5:
    -The string 'oranges' is not a digit, so the condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
    -The action `lis.append(int(i))` is not executed.

The final value of `lis` is [].

The final value of `n - sum(lis)` is 21 - 0 = 21.
