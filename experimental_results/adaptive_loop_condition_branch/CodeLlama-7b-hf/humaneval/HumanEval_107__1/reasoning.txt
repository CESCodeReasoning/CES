The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is odd, so the condition `i % 2 == 1` is true.
    -The number 1 is not a palindrome, so the condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is false, so the branch is not taken.
    -The variable `odd_palindrome_count` is not updated.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 2 is even, so the condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
    -The number 2 is a palindrome, so the condition `is_palindrome(i)` is true.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 0 and is_palindrome(i)` is true, so the branch is taken.
    -The variable `even_palindrome_count` is updated to 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_palindrome(1)` is (1, 0).
