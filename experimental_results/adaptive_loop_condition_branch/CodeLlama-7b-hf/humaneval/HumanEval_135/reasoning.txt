The function `can_arrange` is called with ( arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( len(arr) = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    - i < len(arr) when i=1 and len(arr)=5
    - The condition `arr[i]<arr[i-1]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `i < len(arr)` is true. The second branch is taken.
    -`ind=i` updates `ind` to 1 ( -1 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - i < len(arr) when i=2 and len(arr)=5
    - The condition `arr[i]<arr[i-1]` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`ind=i` updates `ind` to 2 ( 1 + 1 = 2 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - i < len(arr) when i=3 and len(arr)=5
    - The condition `arr[i]<arr[i-1]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `i < len(arr)` is true. The second branch is taken.
    -`ind=i` updates `ind` to 3 ( 2 + 1 = 3 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    - i < len(arr) when i=4 and len(arr)=5
    - The condition `arr[i]<arr[i-1]` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`ind=i` updates `ind` to 4 ( 3 + 1 = 4 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5):
    - i < len(arr) when i=5 and len(arr)=5
    - The condition `arr[i]<arr[i-1]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `i < len(arr)` is false. The second branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `ind=i` updates `ind` to 5 ( 4 + 1 = 5 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is now 5.
