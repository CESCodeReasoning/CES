The function `is_multiply_prime` is called with ( a = 125 ).
Inside the function, a function `is_prime` is defined.
The function `is_prime` takes a number n as its parameter.
The function `is_prime` iterates through all the numbers from 2 to n-1 to check if n is divisible by any of them.
If n is divisible by any number, then it is not a prime number.
If n is not divisible by any number, then it is a prime number.

The outer loop iterates through all the numbers from 2 to 100.
If the number is not a prime number, then the outer loop skips to the next iteration.
If the number is a prime number, then the inner loop iterates through all the numbers from 2 to 100.
If the number is not a prime number, then the inner loop skips to the next iteration.
