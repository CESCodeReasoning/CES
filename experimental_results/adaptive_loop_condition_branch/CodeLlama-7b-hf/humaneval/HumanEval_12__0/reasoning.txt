The function `longest` is called with ( strings = ['x', 'y', 'z'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxlen` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the list of strings.
First Iteration (s = 'x')
   - The condition `not strings` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - The condition `len(s) == maxlen` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - The action `maxlen = max(len(x) for x in strings)` updates `maxlen` to 1.
Second Iteration (s = 'y')
   - The condition `not strings` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - The condition `len(s) == maxlen` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - The action `maxlen = max(len(x) for x in strings)` updates `maxlen` to 1.
Third Iteration (s = 'z')
   - The condition `not strings` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - The condition `len(s) == maxlen` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - The action `maxlen = max(len(x) for x in strings)` updates `maxlen` to 1.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `maxlen`, which is 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `longest(['x', 'y', 'z'])` is 1.
