The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [1, 2, 3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 0 through 2 (since ( len(lst) = 3 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 % 3 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i %3 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` results in `result = [1]`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which still satisfies ( 1 % 3 == 0 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` updates `result` to [1, 4].
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which now satisfies ( 2 % 3 == 0 ).
   - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` updates `result` to [1, 4, 9].
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `result`, which is now [1, 4, 9].

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_squares([1, 2, 3])` is 16.
