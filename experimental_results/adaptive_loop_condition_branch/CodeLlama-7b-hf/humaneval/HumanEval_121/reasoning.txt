The function solution takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list that are odd.
To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [5, 8, 7, 1], we need to sum all even numbers in the list that are odd.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [5, 8, 7, 1] is 13.
