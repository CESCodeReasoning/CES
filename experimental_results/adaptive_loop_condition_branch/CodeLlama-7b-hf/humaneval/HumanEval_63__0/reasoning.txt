The function `fibfib` is called with ( n = 1 ).
The condition `n == 0` is false, therefore the first branch is not taken.
The condition `n == 1` is false, therefore the second branch is not taken.
The condition `n == 2` is true, therefore the third branch is taken.
The third branch's action: `return 1` returns 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fibfib(1)` is 1.
