The function `numerical_letter_grade` is called with ( grades = [1.2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `letter_grade` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates through the list of grades.
First Iteration (gpa = 1.2)
   - The condition `gpa == 4.0` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 3.7` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 3.3` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 3.0` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 2.7` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 2.3` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 2.0` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 1.7` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 1.3` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 1.0` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 0.7` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 0.0` is false.
   - The `else` block's action: `letter_grade.append("E")` appends "E" to the list `letter_grade`.
   - The list `letter_grade` is now [E].
Second Iteration (gpa = 1.2)
   - The condition `gpa == 4.0` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 3.7` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 3.3` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 3.0` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 2.7` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 2.3` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 2.0` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 1.7` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 1.3` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 1.0` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 0.7` is false.
   - The condition `gpa > 0.0` is false.
   - The `else` block's action: `letter_grade.append("E")` appends "E" to the list `letter_grade`.
   - The list `letter_grade` is now [E, E].
