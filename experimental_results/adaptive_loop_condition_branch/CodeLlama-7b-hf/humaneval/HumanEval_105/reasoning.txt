The function `sum_of_integer` is called with ( N = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `sum` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( N = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 3 ( 1 + 2 = 3 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 6 ( 3 + 3 = 6 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 10 ( 6 + 4 = 10 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 15 ( 10 + 5 = 15 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `sum`, which is now 15.
