The function `intersperse` is called with ( numbers = [2, 2, 2], delimeter = 2 ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 0 through 1 (since ( len(numbers) = 3 )).
First Iteration (n = 2):
    `result.append(n)` appends 2 to `result` ( [2] ).
    `result.append(delimeter)` appends 2 to `result` ( [2, 2] ).
Second Iteration (n = 2):
    `result.append(n)` appends 2 to `result` ( [2, 2, 2] ).
    `result.append(delimeter)` appends 2 to `result` ( [2, 2, 2, 2] ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( not numbers ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns an empty list as the output.
