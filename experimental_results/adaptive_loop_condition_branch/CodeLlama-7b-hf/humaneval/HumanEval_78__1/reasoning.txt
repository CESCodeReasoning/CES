The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "123456789ABCDEF0" ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 15 (since ( len(num) = 16 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` results in `total = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which still satisfies ( 0 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which now satisfies ( 2 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 3 (`2 + 1 = 3`).
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which still satisfies ( 2 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 4 (`3 + 1 = 4`).
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, now satisfying ( 4 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 5 (`4 + 1 = 5`).
Sixth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which still satisfies ( 4 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 6 (`5 + 1 = 6`).
Seventh Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is 6, which now satisfies ( 6 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 7 (`6 + 1 = 7`).
Eighth Iteration (i = 7)
   - `i` is 7, which still satisfies ( 6 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 8 (`7 + 1 = 8`).
Ninth Iteration (i = 8)
   - `i` is 8, which now satisfies ( 8 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 9 (`8 + 1 = 9`).
Tenth Iteration (i = 9)
   - `i` is 9, which still satisfies ( 8 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 10 (`9 + 1 = 10`).
Eleventh Iteration (i = 10)
   - `i` is 10, which now satisfies ( 10 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 11 (`10 + 1 = 11`).
Twelfth Iteration (i = 11)
   - `i` is 11, which still satisfies ( 10 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 12 (`11 + 1 = 12`).
Thirteenth Iteration (i = 12)
   - `i` is 12, which now satisfies ( 12 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 13 (`12 + 1 = 13`).
Fourteenth Iteration (i = 13)
   - `i` is 13, which still satisfies ( 12 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 14 (`13 + 1 = 14`).
Fifteenth Iteration (i = 14)
   - `i` is 14, which now satisfies ( 14 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 15 (`14 + 1 = 15`).
Sixteenth Iteration (i = 15)
   - `i` is 15, which now satisfies ( 15 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 16 (`15 + 1 = 16`).
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `total`, which is now 16.

Therefore, the final output of the function `hex_key("123456789ABCDEF0")` is 16.
