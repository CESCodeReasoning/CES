The function `digits` is called with ( n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1.
A variable `odd_count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the string representation of `n` (which is "5").
First Iteration (digit = "5")
   - `digit` is "5", which is an integer.
   - `int_digit` is 5, which is an odd integer.
   - The condition `int_digit%2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product= product*int_digit` results in `product = 5`.
   - Action: `odd_count+=1` results in `odd_count = 1`.
Second Iteration (digit = "5")
   - `digit` is "5", which is an integer.
   - `int_digit` is 5, which is an odd integer.
   - The condition `int_digit%2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product= product*int_digit` results in `product = 5`.
   - Action: `odd_count+=1` results in `odd_count = 2`.
Third Iteration (digit = "5")
   - `digit` is "5", which is an integer.
   - `int_digit` is 5, which is an odd integer.
   - The condition `int_digit%2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product= product*int_digit` results in `product = 5`.
   - Action: `odd_count+=1` results in `odd_count = 3`.
Fourth Iteration (digit = "5")
   - `digit` is "5", which is an integer.
   - `int_digit` is 5, which is an odd integer.
   - The condition `int_digit%2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product= product*int_digit` results in `product = 5`.
   - Action: `odd_count+=1` results in `odd_count = 4`.
Fifth Iteration (digit = "5")
   - `digit` is "5", which is an integer.
   - `int_digit` is 5, which is an odd integer.
   - The condition `int_digit%2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product= product*int_digit` results in `product = 5`.
   - Action: `odd_count+=1` results in `odd_count = 5`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `product`, which is 5.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digits(5)` is 5.
