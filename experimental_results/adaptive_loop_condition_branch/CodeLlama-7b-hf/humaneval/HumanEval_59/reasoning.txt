The function `largest_prime_factor` is called with ( n = 15 ).
Inside the function, a function `is_prime` is defined.
The function `is_prime` is called with ( k = 15 ).
Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to 2.
The loop iterates from 2 through 14 (since ( k = 15 )).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < 15 ).
   - The condition `k % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < 15 ).
   - The condition `k % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Third Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < 15 ).
   - The condition `k % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Fourth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < 15 ).
   - The condition `k % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Fifth Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is 6, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < 15 ).
   - The condition `k % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Sixth Iteration (i = 7)
   - `i` is 7, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < 15 ).
   - The condition `k % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Seventh Iteration (i = 8)
   - `i` is 8, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < 15 ).
   - The condition `k % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Eighth Iteration (i = 9)
   - `i` is 9, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < 15 ).
   - The condition `k % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Ninth Iteration (i = 10)
   - `i` is 10, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < 15 ).
   - The condition `k % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Tenth Iteration (i = 11)
   - `i` is 11, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < 15 ).
   - The condition `k % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Eleventh Iteration (i = 12)
   - `i` is 12, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < 15 ).
   - The condition `k % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Twelfth Iteration (i = 13)
   - `i` is 13, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < 15 ).
   - The condition `k % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Thirteenth Iteration (i = 14)
   - `i` is 14, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < 15 ).
   - The condition `k % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Fourteenth Iteration (i = 15)
   - `i` is 15, which now satisfies ( 2 <= i < 15 ).
   - The condition `k % i == 0` is true.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `largest`, which is now 5.

Therefore, the final output of the function `largest_prime_factor(15)` is 5.
