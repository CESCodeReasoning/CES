The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "2/4", n = "8/4" ).
The function splits the strings into two parts, `a` and `b` for `x` and `c` and `d` for `n`.
The variables `numerator` and `denom` are initialized to the product of `a` and `c` and `b` and `d` respectively.
The condition `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` is evaluated.
If the condition is true, then the if branch is taken and the method returns True.
Otherwise, the else branch is taken and the method returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("2/4", "8/4")` is False.
