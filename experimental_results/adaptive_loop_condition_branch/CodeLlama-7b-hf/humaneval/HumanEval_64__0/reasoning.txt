The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "bYe" ).
The variable `vowels` is initialized to "aeiouAEIOU".
The variable `n_vowels` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the string "bYe".
First Iteration (c = "b")
   - The condition `c in vowels` is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels` is not updated.
Second Iteration (c = "Y")
   - The condition `c in vowels` is true.
   - Action: `n_vowels` is updated to 1.
Third Iteration (c = "e")
   - The condition `c in vowels` is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels` is not updated.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `n_vowels`, which is now 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("bYe")` is 1.
