The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -4, 5, 6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the list of operations.
First Iteration (op = 1)
   - `balance` is 0, so `balance += op` results in `balance = 1`.
   - The condition `balance < 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Second Iteration (op = 2)
   - `balance` is 1, so `balance += op` results in `balance = 3`.
   - The condition `balance < 0` is false.
   - Action: `return False` returns `False`.
Third Iteration (op = -4)
   - `balance` is 3, so `balance += op` results in `balance = -1`.
   - The condition `balance < 0` is true.
   - Action: `return True` returns `True`.
Fourth Iteration (op = 5)
   - `balance` is -1, so `balance += op` results in `balance = -6`.
   - The condition `balance < 0` is true.
   - Action: `return True` returns `True`.
Fifth Iteration (op = 6)
   - `balance` is -6, so `balance += op` results in `balance = -12`.
   - The condition `balance < 0` is true.
   - Action: `return True` returns `True`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5, 6])` is `True`.
