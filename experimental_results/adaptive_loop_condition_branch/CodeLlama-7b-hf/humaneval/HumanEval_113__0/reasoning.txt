The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['3',"11111111"]).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates through the list `lst` which has two elements.
First Iteration (arr = '3'):
    `sum(int(d) % 2 == 1 for d in arr)` = 1 since there is one odd element in the string '3'.
    `res.append` appends the string "the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput." to the list `res`.
Second Iteration (arr = "11111111"):
    `sum(int(d) % 2 == 1 for d in arr)` = 7 since there are 7 odd elements in the string "11111111".
    `res.append` appends the string "the number of odd elements 7n the str7ng 7 of the 7nput." to the list `res`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the list `res`, which is now ['the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.', 'the number of odd elements 7n the str7ng 7 of the 7nput.'].
