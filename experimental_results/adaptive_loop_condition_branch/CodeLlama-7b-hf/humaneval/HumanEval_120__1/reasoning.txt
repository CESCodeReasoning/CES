The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [123, -123, 20, 0 , 1, 2, -3], k = 3 ).
The condition `k == 0` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
The last `k` elements of the array are returned.

Therefore, the final output of the function `maximum([123, -123, 20, 0 , 1, 2, -3], 3)` is [20, 1, 2].
