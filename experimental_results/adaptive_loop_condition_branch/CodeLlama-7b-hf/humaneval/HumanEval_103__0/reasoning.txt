The function `rounded_avg` is called with ( n = 560, m = 851 ).
Inside the function, a variable `summation` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 560 through 851 (since ( m = 851 )).
First Iteration (i = 560):
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 560 ( 0 + 560 = 560 ).
Second Iteration (i = 561):
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 1121 ( 560 + 561 = 1121 ).
Third Iteration (i = 562)
    `summation += i` updates `summation` to 1683 ( 1121 + 562 =
