The function `factorize` is called with ( n = 18 ).
Inside the function, a variable `fact` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 2 through 6 (since ( n = 18 ) and ( int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) = 6 )).
First Iteration (i = 2):
    - (i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) = 2 <= 6) when i=2
    - (n % i == 0) when i=2 and n=18
    - The condition (n % i == 0) is false. The branch is not taken.
    - The condition (i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) = 2 <= 6) is true. The branch is taken.
    - i is updated to 3.
Second Iteration (i = 3):
    - (i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) = 3 <= 6) when i=3
    - (n % i == 0) when i=3 and n=18
    - The condition (n % i == 0) is false. The branch is not taken.
    - The condition (i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) = 3 <= 6) is true. The branch is taken.
    - i is updated to 4.
Third Iteration (i = 4):
    - (i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) = 4 <= 6) when i=4
    - (n % i == 0) when i=4 and n=18
    - The condition (n % i == 0) is false. The branch is not taken.
    - The condition (i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) = 4 <= 6) is true. The branch is taken.
    - i is updated to 5.
Fourth Iteration (i = 5):
    - (i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) = 5 <= 6) when i=5
    - (n % i == 0) when i=5 and n=18
    - The condition (n % i == 0) is false. The branch is not taken.
    - The condition (i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) = 5 <= 6) is true. The branch is taken.
    - i is updated to 6.
Fifth Iteration (i = 6):
    - (i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) = 6 <= 6) when i=6
    - (n % i == 0) when i=6 and n=18
    - The condition (n % i == 0) is false. The branch is not taken.
    - The condition (i <= int((math.sqrt(n) + 1)) = 6 <= 6) is false. The branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken.
    - The list `fact` is updated to [2, 3].
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `fact`, which is now [2, 3].
