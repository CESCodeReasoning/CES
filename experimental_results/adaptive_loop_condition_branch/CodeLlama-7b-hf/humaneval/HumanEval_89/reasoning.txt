The function `encrypt` is called with ( s = 'hi' ).
Inside the function, a variable `d` is initialized to 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
A variable `out` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates through the characters in the string 'hi'.
First Iteration (c = 'h')
   - The character 'h' is in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', so the condition `c in d` is true.
   - The condition `c in d` is true, so the action `out += d[(d.index(c)+2*2) % 26]` is executed.
   - The action `out += d[(d.index(c)+2*2) % 26]` updates `out` to 'j'.
Second Iteration (c = 'i')
   - The character 'i' is not in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', so the condition `c in d` is false.
   - The condition `c in d` is false, so the action `out += c` is executed.
   - The action `out += c` updates `out` to 'ji'.
Therefore, the final output of the function `encrypt('hi')` is 'jj'.
