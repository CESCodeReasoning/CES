The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the range [1, n + 1].
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the range [1, n + 1].
First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
    - i % 2 == 0: False, the if branch is not taken.
    - x = 0, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
    - x += j: x = 0 + 2 = 2
    - ret += [x]: ret = [2]
Second Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5 and 6.
    - i % 2 == 0: True, the if branch is taken.
    - x = 1, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5 and 6.
    - x *= j: x = 1 * 3 = 3
    - ret += [x]: ret = [2, 3]
Third Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4, 5 and 6.
    - i % 2 == 0: False, the if branch is not taken.
    - x = 0, j in the inner loop is 4, 5 and 6.
    - x += j: x = 0 + 4 = 4
    - ret += [x]: ret = [2, 3, 4]
Forth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5 and 6.
    - i % 2 == 0: True, the if branch is taken.
    - x = 1, j in the inner loop is 5 and 6.
    - x *= j: x = 1 * 5 = 5
    - ret += [x]: ret = [2, 3, 4, 5]
Fifth Iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, j in the inner loop is 6.
    - i % 2 == 0: False, the if branch is not taken.
    - x = 0, j in the inner loop is 6.
    - x += j: x = 0 + 6 = 6
    - ret += [x]: ret = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Sixth Iteration (i=6):
    No more elements to compare.
