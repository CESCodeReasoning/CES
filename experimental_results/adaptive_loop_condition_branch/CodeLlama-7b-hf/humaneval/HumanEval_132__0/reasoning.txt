The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = "[][][[]]" ).
Inside the function, two empty lists are initialized: `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index`.
The loop iterates from 0 through the length of the string (which is 7).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - The character at index 0 is '[', so `opening_bracket_index` is updated to [0].
   - The character at index 0 is not ']', so `closing_bracket_index` is not updated.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - The character at index 1 is ']', so `closing_bracket_index` is updated to [1].
   - The character at index 1 is not '[', so `opening_bracket_index` is not updated.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - The character at index 2 is '[', so `opening_bracket_index` is updated to [0, 2].
   - The character at index 2 is not ']', so `closing_bracket_index` is not updated.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - The character at index 3 is ']', so `closing_bracket_index` is updated to [1, 3].
   - The character at index 3 is not '[', so `opening_bracket_index` is not updated.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - The character at index 4 is '[', so `opening_bracket_index` is updated to [0, 2, 4].
   - The character at index 4 is not ']', so `closing_bracket_index` is not updated.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5)
   - The character at index 5 is ']', so `closing_bracket_index` is updated to [1, 3, 5].
   - The character at index 5 is not '[', so `opening_bracket_index` is not updated.
Seventh Iteration (i = 6)
   - The character at index 6 is ']', so `closing_bracket_index` is updated to [1, 3, 5, 6].
   - The character at index 6 is not '[', so `opening_bracket_index` is not updated.

After the loop completes, the `closing_bracket_index` list is [1, 3, 5, 6].
The `opening_bracket_index` list is [0, 2, 4].

The `closing_bracket_index` list is reversed to [6, 5, 3, 1].

The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0.
The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
The variable `l` is initialized to the length of `closing_bracket_index`, which is 4.

The loop iterates from 0 through the length of `opening_bracket_index` (which is 3).
First Iteration (idx = 0)
   - The index 0 is less than the length of `closing_bracket_index` (which is 4), so the condition `i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i]` is true.
   - The condition `i < l` is true.
   - The condition `idx < closing_bracket_index[i]` is true.
   - The action `cnt += 1` updates `cnt` to 1.
   - The action `i += 1` updates `i` to 1.
Second Iteration (idx = 2)
   - The index 2 is less than the length of `closing_bracket_index` (which is 4), so the condition `i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i]` is true.
   - The condition `i < l` is true.
   - The condition `idx < closing_bracket_index[i]` is true.
   - The action `cnt += 1` updates `cnt` to 2.
   - The action `i += 1` updates `i` to 2.
Third Iteration (idx = 4)
   - The index 4 is less than the length of `closing_bracket_index` (which is 4), so the condition `i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i]` is true.
   - The condition `i < l` is true.
   - The condition `idx < closing_bracket_index[i]` is true.
   - The action `cnt += 1` updates `cnt` to 3.
   - The action `i += 1` updates `i` to 3.

After the loop completes, the variable `cnt` is 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_nested('[][][[]]')` is True.
