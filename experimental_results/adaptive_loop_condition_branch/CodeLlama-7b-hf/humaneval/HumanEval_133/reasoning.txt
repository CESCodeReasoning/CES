The function `sum_squares` is called with (lst = [1, 2, 3]).
Inside the function, a variable `squared` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the list [1, 2, 3].
First Iteration (i = 1):
    `squared += math.ceil(i)**2` updates `squared` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    `squared += math.ceil(i)**2` updates `squared` to 5 ( 1 + 4 = 5 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    `squared += math.ceil(i)**2` updates `squared` to 14 ( 5 + 9 = 14 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `squared`, which is now 14.
