The function `monotonic` is called with ( l = [4, 1, 0, -10] ).
The condition `l == sorted(l)` is false, since the list is not sorted in ascending order.
The condition `l == sorted(l, reverse=True)` is true, since the list is sorted in descending order.
Therefore, the if branch is taken and the method returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])` is True.
