The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['271', '137', '314']).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates through the list `lst` which has 3 elements.
First Iteration (arr = '271'):
    `sum(int(d) % 2 == 1 for d in arr)` = 1 since 271 has 1 odd element.
    `res.append` appends the string "the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput." to the list `res`.
Second Iteration (arr = '137'):
    `sum(int(d) % 2 == 1 for d in arr)` = 1 since 137 has 1 odd element.
    `res.append` appends the string "the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput." to the list `res`.
Third Iteration (arr = '314'):
    `sum(int(d) % 2 == 1 for d in arr)` = 2 since 314 has 2 odd elements.
    `res.append` appends the string "the number of odd elements 2n the str2ng 2 of the 2nput." to the list `res`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the list `res`, which is now ['the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.', 'the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.', 'the number of odd elements 2n the str2ng 2 of the 2nput.'].
