The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = '0' ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the length of the string.
The condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is evaluated.
   - The condition `l == 0` is false.
   - The condition `l == 1` is true.
   - Therefore, the condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is true.
The condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is true, so the `if` block is executed.
   - The condition `l == 0` is false.
   - The condition `l == 1` is true.
   - Therefore, the condition `l == 1` is true.
   - The `if` block's action: `return False` returns False.
