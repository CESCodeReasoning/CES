The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted.
The list `new_lst` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates through the list `lst`.
First Iteration (i = "school")
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` appends "school" to `new_lst`.
Second Iteration (i = "AI")
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` does not append anything to `new_lst`.
Third Iteration (i = "asdf")
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` appends "asdf" to `new_lst`.
Fourth Iteration (i = "b")
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` does not append anything to `new_lst`.

Therefore, the final value of `new_lst` is ["school", "asdf"].
