The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "2020" ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 4 (since ( len(num) = 4 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` results in `total = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which still satisfies ( 0 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which now satisfies ( 2 <= i < len(num) ).
   - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
   - Action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 3 (`2 + 1 = 3`).
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, now outside the previous conditions, falling into the `else` block.
   - The `else` block's action: `total += 1` updates `total` to 4 (`3 + 1 = 4`).
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `total`, which is now 4.

Therefore, the final output of the function `hex_key("2020")` is 4.
