The function has_close_elements(numbers, threshold) takes a list of numbers([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]) and a threshold(0.3) as its parameters.
The outer loop iterats through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by idx in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (idx=0):
    - `idx` is 0, `elem` is 1.0, `idx2` in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

    - `idx` is not equal to `idx2` (idx != idx2), the if branch is taken.
    - `distance` is the absolute value of the difference between `elem` and `elem2` (abs(1.0 - 2.0) = 1.0).
