The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "abcde" ).
The variable `vowels` is initialized to "aeiouAEIOU".
The variable `n_vowels` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the string "abcde".
First Iteration (c = "a")
   - The condition `c in vowels` is true.
   - Action: `n_vowels += 1` updates `n_vowels` to 1.
Second Iteration (c = "b")
   - The condition `c in vowels` is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels += 1` does not change `n_vowels`.
Third Iteration (c = "c")
   - The condition `c in vowels` is true.
   - Action: `n_vowels += 1` updates `n_vowels` to 2.
Fourth Iteration (c = "d")
   - The condition `c in vowels` is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels += 1` does not change `n_vowels`.
Fifth Iteration (c = "e")
   - The condition `c in vowels` is true.
   - Action: `n_vowels += 1` updates `n_vowels` to 3.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `n_vowels`, which is now 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("abcde")` is 3.
