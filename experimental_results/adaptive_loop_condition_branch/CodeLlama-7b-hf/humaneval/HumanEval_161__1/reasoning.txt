The function `solve` is called with ( s = "ab" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` and `idx` are initialized to 0.
A variable `new_str` is initialized to the list of characters in `s`.
The loop iterates through the characters in `s`.
First Iteration (i = 'a')
   - `i` is 'a', which is not an alphabetical character.
   - The condition `i.isalpha()` is false.
   - Action: `new_str[idx] = i.swapcase()` does not change `new_str`.
   - `idx` is incremented to 1.
Second Iteration (i = 'b')
   - `i` is 'b', which is not an alphabetical character.
   - The condition `i.isalpha()` is false.
   - Action: `new_str[idx] = i.swapcase()` does not change `new_str`.
   - `idx` is incremented to 2.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `s`, which is "ab".

Therefore, the final output of the function `solve("ab")` is "ab".
