The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 10, b = 15 ).
First Iteration:
    - b = 15, a % b = 5.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 15, b to 5.
Second Iteration:
    - b = 5, a % b = 0.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 5, b to 0.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `a`, which is now 5.
