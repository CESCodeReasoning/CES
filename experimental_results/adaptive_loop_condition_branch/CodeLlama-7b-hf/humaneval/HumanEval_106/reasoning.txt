The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterats through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - i%2 == 0: False, the if branch is not taken.
    - x = 0, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - i%2 == 0: True, the if branch is taken.
    - x = 1, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - i%2 == 0: False, the if branch is not taken.
    - x = 0, j in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - i%2 == 0: True, the if branch is taken.
    - x = 0, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - i%2 == 0: False, the if branch is not taken.
    - x = 0, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
No more elements to compare.
