The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "bye" ).
The variable `vowels` is initialized to "aeiouAEIOU".
The variable `n_vowels` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the string "bye" (since ( s = "bye" )).
First Iteration (c = "b")
   - `c` is "b", which is not in the string "aeiouAEIOU".
   - The condition `c in vowels` is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels += 1` does not update `n_vowels`.
Second Iteration (c = "y")
   - `c` is "y", which is in the string "aeiouAEIOU".
   - The condition `c in vowels` is true.
   - Action: `n_vowels += 1` updates `n_vowels` to 1 (`0 + 1 = 1`).
Third Iteration (c = "e")
   - `c` is "e", which is in the string "aeiouAEIOU".
   - The condition `c in vowels` is true.
   - Action: `n_vowels += 1` updates `n_vowels` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Fourth Iteration (c = "e")
   - `c` is "e", which is in the string "aeiouAEIOU".
   - The condition `c in vowels` is true.
   - Action: `n_vowels += 1` updates `n_vowels` to 3 (`2 + 1 = 3`).
Fifth Iteration (c = " ")
   - `c` is " ", which is not in the string "aeiouAEIOU".
   - The condition `c in vowels` is false.
   - Action: `n_vowels += 1` does not update `n_vowels`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `n_vowels`, which is now 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("bye")` is 3.
