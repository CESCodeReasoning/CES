The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [1, -1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the list `nums`.
First Iteration (num = 1)
   - `num` is 1, so `s` becomes 1.
   - The condition `s < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - Action: `max_sum = max(s, max_sum)` updates `max_sum` to 1.
Second Iteration (num = -1)
   - `num` is -1, so `s` becomes -1.
   - The condition `s < 0` is true, so the branch is taken.
   - Action: `s = 0` updates `s` to 0.
   - Action: `max_sum = max(s, max_sum)` updates `max_sum` to 1.
Third Iteration (num = 1)
   - `num` is 1, so `s` becomes 0.
   - The condition `s < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - Action: `max_sum = max(s, max_sum)` updates `max_sum` to 1.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `min_sum`, which is -1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([1, -1])` is -1.
