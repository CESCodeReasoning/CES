The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 144, b = 60 ).
First Iteration:
    - b = 60, a % b = 44.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 60, b to 44.
Second Iteration:
    - b = 44, a % b = 16.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 44, b to 16.
Third Iteration:
    - b = 16, a % b = 0.
    - a, b = b, a % b updates a to 16, b to 0.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `a`, which is now 16.
