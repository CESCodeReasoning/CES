The function `intersperse` is called with ( numbers = [5, 6, 3, 2], delimeter = 8 ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 0 through 2 (since ( len(numbers) = 4 )).
First Iteration (n = 5):
    `result.append(n)` appends 5 to `result` ( [5] ).
    `result.append(delimeter)` appends 8 to `result` ( [5, 8] ).
Second Iteration (n = 6):
    `result.append(n)` appends 6 to `result` ( [5, 8, 6] ).
    `result.append(delimeter)` appends 8 to `result` ( [5, 8, 6, 8] ).
Third Iteration (n = 3):
    `result.append(n)` appends 3 to `result` ( [5, 8, 6, 8, 3] ).
    `result.append(delimeter)` appends 8 to `result` ( [5, 8, 6, 8, 3, 8] ).
Fourth Iteration (n = 2):
    `result.append(n)` appends 2 to `result` ( [5, 8, 6, 8, 3, 8, 2] ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( not numbers ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `result` as the output.
