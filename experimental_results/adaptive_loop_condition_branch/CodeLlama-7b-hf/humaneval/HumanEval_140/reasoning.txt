The function `fix_spaces` is called with ( text = "Example" ).
Inside the function, a variable `new_text` is initialized to the empty string.
The loop iterates from 0 through 6 (since ( len(text) = 6 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - i < len(text) when i=0
    - text[i] == " " when text[i] = "E"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `i < len(text)` is true. The second branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - i < len(text) when i=1
    - text[i] == " " when text[i] = "x"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `i < len(text)` is true. The second branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 2 ( 1 + 1 = 2 ).
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - i < len(text) when i=2
    - text[i] == " " when text[i] = "a"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `i < len(text)` is true. The second branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 3 ( 2 + 1 = 3 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - i < len(text) when i=3
    - text[i] == " " when text[i] = "m"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `i < len(text)` is true. The second branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 4 ( 3 + 1 = 4 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - i < len(text) when i=4
    - text[i] == " " when text[i] = "p"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `i < len(text)` is true. The second branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 5 ( 4 + 1 = 5 ).
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - i < len(text) when i=5
    - text[i] == " " when text[i] = "l"
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `i < len(text)` is true. The second branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 6 ( 5 + 1 = 6 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `new_text`, which is now "E_x_a_m_p_l".
