The function `compare_one` is called with ( a = 1, b = 2 ).
The variable `temp_a` is initialized to `a`, which is 1.
The variable `temp_b` is initialized to `b`, which is 2.
The condition `isinstance(temp_a, str)` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition `isinstance(temp_b, str)` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition `float(temp_a) == float(temp_b)` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The function returns `a` which is 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one(1, 2)` is 1.
