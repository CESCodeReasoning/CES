The function `search` is called with ( lst = [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] ).
Inside the function, a variable `frq` is initialized to a list of zeros of length ( max(lst) + 1 ) = 9.
The loop iterates from 1 through 8 (since ( len(lst) = 8 )).
First Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which is less than 1.
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Second Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which is less than 2.
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Third Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which is less than 3.
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which is less than 4.
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, which is less than 5.
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Sixth Iteration (i = 6)
   - `i` is 6, which is less than 6.
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Seventh Iteration (i = 7)
   - `i` is 7, which is less than 7.
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Eighth Iteration (i = 8)
   - `i` is 8, which is less than 8.
   - The condition `frq[i] >= i` is false.
   - Action: `ans` remains -1.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is -1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `search([8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8])` is -1.
