The function `parse_nested_parens` is called with ( paren_string = "(()(())((())))" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` and `max_depth` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
    -The maximum depth is 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 2.
    -The maximum depth is 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 3.
    -The maximum depth is 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 4.
    -The maximum depth is 4.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 5.
    -The maximum depth is 5.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 4.
    -The maximum depth is 5.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 3.
    -The maximum depth is 5.
Iteration 8:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 2.
    -The maximum depth is 5.
Iteration 9:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
    -The maximum depth is 5.
Iteration 10:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 0.
    -The maximum depth is 5.
Iteration 11:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
    -The maximum depth is 5.
Iteration 12:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 2.
    -The maximum depth is 5.
Iteration 13:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 3.
    -The maximum depth is 5.
Iteration 14:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 4.
    -The maximum depth is 5.
Iteration 15:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth becomes 5.
    -The maximum depth is 5.
Iteration 16:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 4.
    -The maximum depth is 5.
Iteration 17:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 3.
    -The maximum depth is 5.
Iteration 18:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 2.
    -The maximum depth is 5.
Iteration 19:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 1.
    -The maximum depth is 5.
Iteration 20:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth becomes 0.
    -The maximum depth is 5.

Therefore, the final output of the function `parse_nested_parens("(()(())((())))")` is [5, 5, 5, 5].
