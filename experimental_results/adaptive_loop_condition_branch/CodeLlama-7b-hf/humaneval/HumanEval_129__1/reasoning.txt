The function minPath(grid, k) takes a 2D list of integers (grid) and an integer (k) as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - grid[i][j]=8: compare with 14, 9, 2, 6, 4, 13, 15, 5, 7, 1, 12, 3, 10, 11, 16:
        - When j = 1 (grid[j]=14), the condition `grid[i][j] == 1` is False, the if branch is not taken.
