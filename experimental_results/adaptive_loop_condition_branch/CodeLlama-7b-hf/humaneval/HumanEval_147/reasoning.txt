The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - `A[i]=1`: compare with 5, 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 1 (A[j]=5), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (A[j]=4), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (A[j]=3), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (A[j]=7), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (A[j]=4), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - `A[i]=5`: compare with 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 2 (A[j]=4), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (A[j]=3), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (A[j]=7), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (A[j]=4), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
    - `A[i]=4`: compare with 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 3 (A[j]=3), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (A[j]=7), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (A[j]=4), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
    - `A[i]=3`: compare with 7, 4:
        - When j = 4 (A[j]=7), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (A[j]=4), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - `A[i]=7`: compare with 4:
        - When j = 5 (A[j]=4), the condition `(A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.
