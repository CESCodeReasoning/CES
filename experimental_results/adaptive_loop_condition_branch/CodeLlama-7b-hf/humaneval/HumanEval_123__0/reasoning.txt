The function `get_odd_collatz` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_collatz` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 1 through 1 (since ( n = 1 )).
First Iteration (n = 1):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=1
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`odd_collatz = []` updates `odd_collatz` to an empty list.
Second Iteration (n = 1):
    - n % 2 == 0 when n=1.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`odd_collatz = []` updates `odd_collatz` to an empty list.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `odd_collatz`, which is now an empty list.
