The function `is_sorted` is called with ( lst = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count_digit` is initialized to a dictionary with keys (1, 2, 3, 4) and values 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 4 (since ( len(lst) = 4 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit` to {1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0}.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit` to {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 0}.
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit` to {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 0}.
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
    `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit` to {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}.
After the loop completes, the condition ( any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst) ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken and the function returns `False` as the output.
