The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = "Wow" ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the length of the string (l = 3).
The condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is false, so the first branch is not taken.
The loop iterates from 2 through 3 (since ( l = 3 )).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which satisfies ( 2 <= i < l ).
   - The condition `l % i == 0` is false, so the second branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which still satisfies ( 2 <= i < l ).
   - The condition `l % i == 0` is false, so the second branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which now satisfies ( 2 <= i < l ).
   - The condition `l % i == 0` is true (while the first condition `l == 0 or l == 1` is false).
   - Action: `return False` returns False.
Therefore, the final output of the function `prime_length('Wow')` is False.
