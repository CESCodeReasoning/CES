The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the range [1, n + 1].
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the range [1, n + 1].
First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - i % 2 == 0: The condition `i % 2 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - x = 0: The variable x is assigned 0.
    - j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - x += j: The variable x is assigned 2.
    - ret += [x]: The list ret is appended with 2.
Second Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - i % 2 == 0: The condition `i % 2 == 0` is True, the if branch is taken.
    - x = 1: The variable x is assigned 1.
    - j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - x *= j: The variable x is assigned 1 * 3 = 3.
    - ret += [x]: The list ret is appended with 3.
Third Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - i % 2 == 0: The condition `i % 2 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - x = 0: The variable x is assigned 0.
    - j in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - x += j: The variable x is assigned 4.
    - ret += [x]: The list ret is appended with 4.
Forth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - i % 2 == 0: The condition `i % 2 == 0` is True, the if branch is taken.
    - x = 1: The variable x is assigned 1.
    - j in the inner loop is 5.
    - x *= j: The variable x is assigned 1 * 5 = 5.
    - ret += [x]: The list ret is appended with 5.
Fifth Iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - i % 2 == 0: The condition `i % 2 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - x = 0: The variable x is assigned 0.
    - j in the inner loop is 5.
    - x += j: The variable x is assigned 5.
    - ret += [x]: The list ret is appended with 5.
