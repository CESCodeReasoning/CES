The function `is_sorted` is called with ( lst = [3, 2, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count_digit` is initialized to a dictionary with keys ( 3, 2, 1 ) and values ( 0, 0, 0 ).
The loop iterates from 0 through 2 (since ( len(lst) = 3 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit` to {3: 1, 2: 0, 1: 0}.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit` to {3: 1, 2: 1, 1: 0}.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
    `count_digit[i] += 1` updates `count_digit` to {3: 1, 2: 1, 1: 1}.
After the loop completes, the condition ( any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst) ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken and the function returns `False` as the output.
