The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with ( n = 9 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is odd, so the condition `i % 2 == 1` is true.
    -The number 1 is not a palindrome, so the condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is false, so the branch is not taken.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 2 is even, so the condition `i % 2 == 1` is false.
    -The number 2 is a palindrome, so the condition `is_palindrome(i)` is true.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is true, so the branch is taken.
    -The action `odd_palindrome_count += 1` updates `odd_palindrome_count` to 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 3 is odd, so the condition `i % 2 == 1` is true.
    -The number 3 is not a palindrome, so the condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is false, so the branch is not taken.
Iteration 4:
    -The number 4 is even, so the condition `i % 2 == 1` is false.
    -The number 4 is a palindrome, so the condition `is_palindrome(i)` is true.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is true, so the branch is taken.
    -The action `even_palindrome_count += 1` updates `even_palindrome_count` to 1.
Iteration 5:
    -The number 5 is odd, so the condition `i % 2 == 1` is true.
    -The number 5 is not a palindrome, so the condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is false, so the branch is not taken.
Iteration 6:
    -The number 6 is even, so the condition `i % 2 == 1` is false.
    -The number 6 is a palindrome, so the condition `is_palindrome(i)` is true.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is true, so the branch is taken.
    -The action `odd_palindrome_count += 1` updates `odd_palindrome_count` to 2.
Iteration 7:
    -The number 7 is odd, so the condition `i % 2 == 1` is true.
    -The number 7 is not a palindrome, so the condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is false, so the branch is not taken.
Iteration 8:
    -The number 8 is even, so the condition `i % 2 == 1` is false.
    -The number 8 is a palindrome, so the condition `is_palindrome(i)` is true.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is true, so the branch is taken.
    -The action `even_palindrome_count += 1` updates `even_palindrome_count` to 2.
Iteration 9:
    -The number 9 is odd, so the condition `i % 2 == 1` is true.
    -The number 9 is not a palindrome, so the condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i)` is false, so the branch is not taken.
Return Statement
    -After the loop completes, the function returns the tuple `(even_palindrome_count, odd_palindrome_count)`, which is (2, 2).
