<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def solution(lst):
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx % 2 == 0 and x % 2 == 1])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
solution([30, 13, 23, 32])

[/INST]

[CODE]
def solution(lst):
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx % 2 == 0 and x % 2 == 1])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
solution([30, 13, 23, 32])
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function solution takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list that are also odd.
To determine the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32], we need to sum all even numbers in the list that are also odd.
Therefore, the output of executing the function solution on the input [30, 13, 23, 32] is 30 + 23 = 53.
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
53
