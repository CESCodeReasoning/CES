The function `triangle_area` is called with ( a = 1, b = 2, c = 10 ).
The condition `a + b <= c` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition `a + c <= b` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The condition `b + c <= a` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The if branch is not taken, therefore the method returns -1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `triangle_area(1, 2, 10)` is -1.
