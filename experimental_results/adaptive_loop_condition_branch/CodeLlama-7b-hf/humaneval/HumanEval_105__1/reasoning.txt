The function `by_length` is called with (arr = []).
The variable `dic` is initialized to a dictionary.
The variable `sorted_arr` is initialized to the sorted version of `arr` in reverse order.
The variable `new_arr` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates through the sorted version of `arr` in reverse order.
First Iteration:
    `var` = 9
    `dic[var]` = "Nine"
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends "Nine" to `new_arr`
Second Iteration:
    `var` = 8
    `dic[var]` = "Eight"
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends "Eight" to `new_arr`
Third Iteration:
    `var` = 7
    `dic[var]` = "Seven"
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends "Seven" to `new_arr`
Fourth Iteration:
    `var` = 6
    `dic[var]` = "Six"
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends "Six" to `new_arr`
Fifth Iteration:
    `var` = 5
    `dic[var]` = "Five"
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends "Five" to `new_arr`
Sixth Iteration:
    `var` = 4
    `dic[var]` = "Four"
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends "Four" to `new_arr`
Seventh Iteration:
    `var` = 3
    `dic[var]` = "Three"
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends "Three" to `new_arr`
Eighth Iteration:
    `var` = 2
    `dic[var]` = "Two"
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends "Two" to `new_arr`
Ninth Iteration:
    `var` = 1
    `dic[var]` = "One"
    `new_arr.append(dic[var])` appends "One" to `new_arr`
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `new_arr`, which is now ["Nine", "Eight", "Seven", "Six", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "One"].
