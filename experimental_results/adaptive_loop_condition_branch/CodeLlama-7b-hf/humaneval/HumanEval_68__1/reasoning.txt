The function `pluck` is called with ( arr = [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2] ).
The condition `len(arr) == 0` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The variable `evens` is initialized to the list of even numbers in `arr` (i.e. [0, 0, 2]).
The condition `evens == []` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken.
The return statement returns the list `[min(evens), arr.index(min(evens))]` which is [0, 4].

Therefore, the final output of the function `pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])` is [0, 4].
