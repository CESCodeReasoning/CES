The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'xywyx' ).
Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 4 (since ( len(text) = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` returns False.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which still satisfies ( 0 <= i < 5 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `return False` returns False.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which now satisfies ( 2 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` returns False.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which now satisfies ( 3 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is true.
   - Action: `return False` returns False.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, now outside the previous conditions, falling into the `else` block.
   - The `else` block's action: `return True` returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_palindrome('xywyx')` is False.
