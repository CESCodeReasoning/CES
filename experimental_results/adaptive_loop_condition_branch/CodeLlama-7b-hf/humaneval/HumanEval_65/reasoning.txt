The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 100, shift = 2 ).
The variable `s` is initialized to the string representation of `x`, which is "100".
The condition `shift > len(s)` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns the reversed string of `s`, which is "001".

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(100, 2)` is "001".
