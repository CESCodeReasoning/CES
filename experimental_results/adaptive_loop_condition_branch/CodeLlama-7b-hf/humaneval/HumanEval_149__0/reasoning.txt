The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["d", "dcba", "abcd", "a"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted.
The list `new_lst` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates through the list `lst`.
First Iteration (i = "d")
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` does not append anything to `new_lst`.
Second Iteration (i = "dcba")
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` appends "dcba" to `new_lst`.
Third Iteration (i = "abcd")
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` appends "abcd" to `new_lst`.
Fourth Iteration (i = "a")
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is false.
   - Action: `new_lst.append(i)` does not append anything to `new_lst`.

Therefore, the final value of `new_lst` is ["dcba", "abcd"].
