The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['()(', ')'] ).
Inside the function, a function `check` is defined.
The function `check` takes a string as input and returns a boolean value.
The function `check` iterates through the string and checks if the number of opening parentheses is equal to the number of closing parentheses.
