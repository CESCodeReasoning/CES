The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the list `nums`.
First Iteration (num = 2)
   - `num` is 2, so `s` becomes -2.
   - The condition `s < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - Action: `max_sum = max(s, max_sum)` updates `max_sum` to 2.
Second Iteration (num = 3)
   - `num` is 3, so `s` becomes -5.
   - The condition `s < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - Action: `max_sum = max(s, max_sum)` updates `max_sum` to 5.
Third Iteration (num = 4)
   - `num` is 4, so `s` becomes -9.
   - The condition `s < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - Action: `max_sum = max(s, max_sum)` updates `max_sum` to 9.
Fourth Iteration (num = 1)
   - `num` is 1, so `s` becomes -10.
   - The condition `s < 0` is true, so the branch is taken.
   - Action: `s = 0` sets `s` to 0.
   - Action: `max_sum = max(s, max_sum)` updates `max_sum` to 9.
Fifth Iteration (num = 2)
   - `num` is 2, so `s` becomes -12.
   - The condition `s < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - Action: `max_sum = max(s, max_sum)` updates `max_sum` to 12.
Sixth Iteration (num = 4)
   - `num` is 4, so `s` becomes -16.
   - The condition `s < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - Action: `max_sum = max(s, max_sum)` updates `max_sum` to 16.
Seventh Iteration (num = 1)
   - `num` is 1, so `s` becomes -17.
   - The condition `s < 0` is true, so the branch is taken.
   - Action: `s = 0` sets `s` to 0.
   - Action: `max_sum = max(s, max_sum)` updates `max_sum` to 16.
Eighth Iteration (num = 4)
   - `num` is 4, so `s` becomes -20.
   - The condition `s < 0` is false, so the branch is not taken.
   - Action: `max_sum = max(s, max_sum)` updates `max_sum` to 20.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4])` is -20.
