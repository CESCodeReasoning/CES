The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [5, -2, 1, -5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the list `nums`.
First Iteration (num = 5)
   - `num` is 5, which is greater than 10.
   - The condition `num > 10` is true.
   - The variable `odd_digits` is initialized to (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
   - The variable `number_as_string` is initialized to "5".
   - The condition `int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits` is true.
   - The condition `int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits` is true.
   - Action: `count += 1` updates `count` to 1.
Second Iteration (num = -2)
   - `num` is -2, which is less than 10.
   - The condition `num > 10` is false.
   - The condition `int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits` is false.
   - The condition `int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits` is false.
   - Action: No action is taken.
Third Iteration (num = 1)
   - `num` is 1, which is greater than 10.
   - The condition `num > 10` is true.
   - The variable `odd_digits` is initialized to (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
   - The variable `number_as_string` is initialized to "1".
   - The condition `int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits` is true.
   - The condition `int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits` is true.
   - Action: `count += 1` updates `count` to 2.
Fourth Iteration (num = -5)
   - `num` is -5, which is less than 10.
   - The condition `num > 10` is false.
   - The condition `int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits` is false.
   - The condition `int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits` is false.
   - Action: No action is taken.

Therefore, the final output of the function `specialFilter([5, -2, 1, -5])` is 2.
