The function `even_odd_count` is called with ( num = 7 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_count` and `odd_count` are initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the string representation of the absolute value of num (since ( num = 7 )).
First Iteration (i = '7')
   - `i` is '7', which is not even.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count +=1` updates `odd_count` to 1 (`0 + 1 = 1`).
Second Iteration (i = '6')
   - `i` is '6', which is even.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is true.
   - Action: `even_count +=1` updates `even_count` to 1 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Third Iteration (i = '5')
   - `i` is '5', which is not even.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count +=1` updates `odd_count` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Fourth Iteration (i = '4')
   - `i` is '4', which is even.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is true.
   - Action: `even_count +=1` updates `even_count` to 2 (`2 + 1 = 3`).
Fifth Iteration (i = '3')
   - `i` is '3', which is not even.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count +=1` updates `odd_count` to 3 (`2 + 1 = 3`).
Sixth Iteration (i = '2')
   - `i` is '2', which is even.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is true.
   - Action: `even_count +=1` updates `even_count` to 3 (`3 + 1 = 4`).
Seventh Iteration (i = '1')
   - `i` is '1', which is not even.
   - The condition `int(i)%2==0` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count +=1` updates `odd_count` to 4 (`3 + 1 = 4`).
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `even_count` and `odd_count`, which are now 4 and 4.

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_count(7)` is (4, 4).
