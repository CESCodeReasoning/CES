The function `digits` is called with ( n = 120 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates through the digits of the number 120.
First Iteration (digit = 1)
   - `digit` is 1, which is odd.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product = product * int_digit` results in `product = 1 * 1 = 1`.
Second Iteration (digit = 2)
   - `digit` is 2, which is even.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 1.
Third Iteration (digit = 0)
   - `digit` is 0, which is even.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 2.
Fourth Iteration (digit = 2)
   - `digit` is 2, which is even.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 3.
Fifth Iteration (digit = 0)
   - `digit` is 0, which is even.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 4.
Sixth Iteration (digit = 2)
   - `digit` is 2, which is even.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 5.
Seventh Iteration (digit = 0)
   - `digit` is 0, which is even.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 6.
Eighth Iteration (digit = 2)
   - `digit` is 2, which is even.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 7.
Ninth Iteration (digit = 0)
   - `digit` is 0, which is even.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 8.
Tenth Iteration (digit = 2)
   - `digit` is 2, which is even.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 9.
Eleventh Iteration (digit = 0)
   - `digit` is 0, which is even.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 10.
Twelfth Iteration (digit = 2)
   - `digit` is 2, which is even.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 11.
Thirteenth Iteration (digit = 0)
   - `digit` is 0, which is even.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 12.
Fourteenth Iteration (digit = 2)
   - `digit` is 2, which is even.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 13.
Fifteenth Iteration (digit = 0)
   - `digit` is 0, which is even.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `odd_count += 1` updates `odd_count` to 14.
Sixteenth Iteration (digit = 2)
   - `digit` is 2, which is even.
