The function `fix_spaces` is called with ( text = "Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow" ).
Inside the function, a variable `new_text` is initialized to the empty string.
The loop iterates from 0 through the length of the text (since ( len(text) = 25 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - i < len(text) when i=0
    - The conditin `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text` is updated to "Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow".
    - `start` and `end` are updated to 0 and 1.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - i < len(text) when i=1
