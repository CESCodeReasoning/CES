The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = ")((".
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth decreases by 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth decreases by 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth increases by 1.

After the loop, the depth is -1, which is less than 0.
Therefore, the function returns False.
