The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxx` is initialized to 0 and `i` to 0.
The loop iterates over the elements of the list `lst`.
The inner function `isPrime` checks if a number is prime.
Iteration 1:
    - The number 0 is not prime, so it is skipped.
Iteration 2:
    - The number 3 is prime, so `maxx` becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    - The number 2 is prime, so `maxx` becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    - The number 1 is not prime, so it is skipped.
Iteration 5:
    - The number 3 is prime, so `maxx` becomes 3.
Iteration 6:
    - The number 5 is prime, so `maxx` becomes 5.
Iteration 7:
    - The number 7 is prime, so `maxx` becomes 7.
Iteration 8:
    - The number 4 is not prime, so it is skipped.
Iteration 9:
    - The number 5 is prime, so `maxx` becomes 7.
Iteration 10:
    - The number 5 is prime, so `maxx` becomes 7.
Iteration 11:
    - The number 5 is prime, so `maxx` becomes 7.
Iteration 12:
    - The number 2 is prime, so `maxx` becomes 7.
Iteration 13:
    - The number 181 is prime, so `maxx` becomes 181.
Iteration 14:
    - The number 32 is prime, so `maxx` becomes 181.
Iteration 15:
    - The number 4 is not prime, so it is skipped.
Iteration 16:
    - The number 32 is prime, so `maxx` becomes 181.
Iteration 17:
    - The number 3 is prime, so `maxx` becomes 181.
Iteration 18:
    - The number 2 is prime, so `maxx` becomes 181.
Iteration 19:
    - The number 32 is prime, so `maxx` becomes 181.
Iteration 20:
    - The number 324 is not prime, so it is skipped.
Iteration 21:
    - The number 4 is not prime, so it is skipped.
Iteration 22:
    - The number 3 is prime, so `maxx` becomes 181.
The loop ends, and the function calculates the sum of the digits of `maxx` (1 + 8 + 1 = 10).
