The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the elements of the list.
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - The element at index 0 is 0.
    - 0 is not greater than maxx (0) and is not a prime number.
    - No update to maxx.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - The element at index 1 is 8.
    - 8 is greater than maxx (0) and is a prime number.
    - Update maxx to 8.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - The element at index 2 is 1.
    - 1 is not greater than maxx (8) and is not a prime number.
    - No update to maxx.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - The element at index 3 is 2.
    - 2 is not greater than maxx (8) and is a prime number.
    - No update to maxx.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - The element at index 4 is 1.
    - 1 is not greater than maxx (8) and is not a prime number.
    - No update to maxx.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - The element at index 5 is 7.
    - 7 is greater than maxx (8) and is a prime number.
    - Update maxx to 7.
After the loop completes, the function calculates the sum of the digits of maxx (7) and returns it.
