The function `sort_numbers` takes a string of space-separated numbers in words as input and returns the numbers sorted in ascending order.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. A dictionary `value_map` is created to map the word numbers to their corresponding integer values.
2. The input string is split by space and filtered to remove any empty strings.
3. The list of numbers is sorted based on the corresponding integer values from the `value_map` dictionary.
4. The sorted list of numbers is joined back into a string with spaces and returned as the output.

For the input 'three five nine', the numbers are 'three', 'five', and 'nine'. After sorting them based on their corresponding integer values, the output will be 'five nine three'.
