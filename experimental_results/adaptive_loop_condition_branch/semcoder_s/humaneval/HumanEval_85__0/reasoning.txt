The function add takes a list lst as input and returns the sum of all elements at odd indices in the list that are even numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 0, 6, 7], we need to sum the elements at odd indices (1, 3) in the list that are even numbers.
The elements at odd indices in the list are 0 and 6.
The even numbers in the list are 4 and 6.
Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 0, 6, 7] is 10.
