The function flip_case takes a string as input and returns the string with the case of each character flipped.
To determine the output of executing the function flip_case on the input 'Hello!', we need to flip the case of each character in the string 'Hello!'.
The string 'Hello!' has characters 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', and '!'. After flipping the case, the string becomes 'hELLO!'.
