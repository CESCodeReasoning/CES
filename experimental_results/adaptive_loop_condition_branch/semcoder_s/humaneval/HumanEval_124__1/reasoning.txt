The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '04-2003' ).
The date is stripped of leading and trailing whitespaces.
The date is split into month, day, and year using '-' as the separator.
Month, day, and year are converted to integers.
The function checks if the month is between 1 and 12. If not, it returns False.
If the month is in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12], it checks if the day is between 1 and 31. If not, it returns False.
If the month is in [4, 6, 9, 11], it checks if the day is between 1 and 30. If not, it returns False.
If the month is 2, it checks if the day is between 1 and 29. If not, it returns False.
If any of the above conditions fail, the function returns False.
If all conditions pass, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('04-2003')` is True.
