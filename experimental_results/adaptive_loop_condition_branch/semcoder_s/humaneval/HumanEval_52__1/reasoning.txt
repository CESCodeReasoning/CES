The function `below_threshold` is called with ( l = [1, 20, 4, 10] , t = 5 ).
The function iterates over each element in the list.
First Iteration (e = 1)
   - `e` is 1, which is not greater than or equal to 5.
Second Iteration (e = 20)
   - `e` is 20, which is greater than 5.
   - The condition `e >= t` is true, so the function returns `False`.
