The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "1/5", n = "5/1" ).
The input strings are split into numerator and denominator parts.
For "1/5", a="1" and b="5". For "5/1", c="5" and d="1".
The numerators are multiplied: 1 * 5 = 5.
The denominators are multiplied: 5 * 1 = 5.
The condition `numerator/denom == int(numerator/denom)` is checked.
Since 5/5 equals 1 and 1 is an integer, the condition is true.
The function returns True.
