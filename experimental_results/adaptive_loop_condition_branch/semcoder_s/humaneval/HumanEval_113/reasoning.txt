The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['1234567']).
Inside the function, an empty list `res` is initialized.
The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
First Iteration (arr = '1234567'):
    The sum of odd elements in '1234567' is calculated.
    The result is appended to `res`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the list `res`.
