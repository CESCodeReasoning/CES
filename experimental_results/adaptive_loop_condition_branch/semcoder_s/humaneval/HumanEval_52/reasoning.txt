The function `below_threshold` is called with ( l = [1, 20, 4, 10] , t = 21 ).
The function iterates over each element in the list.
First Iteration (e = 1)
   - `e` is not greater than or equal to 21, so the condition is false.
Second Iteration (e = 20)
   - `e` is greater than or equal to 21, so the condition is true.
   - The function returns `False`.
