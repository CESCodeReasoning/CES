The function `is_prime` is called with ( n = 6 ).
The function checks if the number is less than 2.
Since 6 is not less than 2, it proceeds to the loop.
The loop iterates from 2 through 5 (since ( n = 6 )).
First Iteration (k = 2)
   - `n` is divisible by 2, so the condition `n % k == 0` is true.
   - The function returns `False`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_prime(6)` is `False`.
