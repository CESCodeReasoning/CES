The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["d", "dcba", "abcd", "a"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted to ["a", "d", "dcba", "abcd"].
A new empty list `new_lst` is initialized.
Iteration 1:
    -The string 'a' has length 1, which is odd.
Iteration 2:
    -The string 'd' has length 1, which is odd.
Iteration 3:
    -The string 'dcba' has length 4, which is even. It is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 4:
    -The string 'abcd' has length 4, which is even. It is appended to `new_lst`.
The function returns the sorted `new_lst` based on the length of the strings, which is ["d", "dcba", "abcd"].
