The function `find_zero` is called with ( xs = [-6, 11, -6, 1] ).
Inside the function, two variables `begin` and `end` are initialized to -1.0 and 1.0 respectively.
The loop checks if the polynomial function evaluated at `begin` and `end` have the same sign. If they have the same sign, it doubles `end` until they have different signs.
Then, it enters a while loop that continues as long as the difference between `end` and `begin` is greater than 1e-10.
Inside the loop, it calculates the center between `begin` and `end`.
Then, it checks if the polynomial function evaluated at `center` and `begin` have the same sign. If they have the same sign, it updates `begin` to `center`, otherwise it updates `end` to `center`.
This process continues until the difference between `end` and `begin` is less than 1e-10.
Finally, it returns the value of `begin`, which is the approximate zero of the polynomial.
