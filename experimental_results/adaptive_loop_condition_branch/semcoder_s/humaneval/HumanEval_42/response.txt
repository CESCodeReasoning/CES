<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def incr_list(l: list):
    return [(e + 1) for e in l]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
incr_list([5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) 
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `incr_list` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1.
To determine the output of executing the function `incr_list` on the input list `[5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`, we need to increment each element by 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `incr_list` on the input list `[5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]` is `[6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]`.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def incr_list(l: list):
    return [(e + 1) for e in l]  # Increments each element in the list by 1 and returns the new list
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
[6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
[/OUTPUT]
