The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "(" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so depth is incremented by 1.
    -The depth is now 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so depth is decremented by 1.
    -The depth is now 0.

The loop ends, and the function checks if the depth is 0. Since it is, the function returns True.
