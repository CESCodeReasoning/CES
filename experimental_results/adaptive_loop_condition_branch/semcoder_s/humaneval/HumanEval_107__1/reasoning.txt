The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is odd and a palindrome, so odd_palindrome_count becomes 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_palindrome(1)` is (0, 1).
