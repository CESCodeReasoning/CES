The function get_positive takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the positive integers from the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input list [5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], we need to filter out the positive integers from the input list.
The positive integers in the input list are 5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input list [5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] is [5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1].
