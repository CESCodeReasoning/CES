<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def get_row(lst, x):
    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst))
              for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
    return sorted(
        sorted(
            coords,
            key=lambda x: x[1],
            reverse=True),
        key=lambda x: x[0])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3)
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `get_row` takes a list of lists `lst` and an integer `x` as input. It finds the coordinates of `x` in `lst` and returns them in sorted order.

- The list comprehension `[(i, j) for i in range(len(lst)) for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]` generates a list of tuples containing the coordinates of `x` in `lst`.
- The `sorted` function is used twice to sort the coordinates first by the row index (in ascending order) and then by the column index (in descending order).

The function `get_row` is called with the input `([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3)`.

The coordinates of `3` in the input list are `(2, 2)`.

The sorted coordinates are `[(2, 2)]`.

Therefore, the output of `get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3)` is `[(2, 2)]`.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def get_row(lst: List[List[int]], x: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst)) for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
    return sorted(sorted(coords, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True), key=lambda x: x[0])
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
[(2, 2)]
[/OUTPUT]
