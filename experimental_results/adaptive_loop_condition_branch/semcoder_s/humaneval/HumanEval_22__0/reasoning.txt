The function `filter_integers` takes a list of values as input and returns a new list containing only the integers from the input list.

- The input list is empty, so there are no elements to filter.
- The list comprehension `[x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]` is executed. Since there are no elements in the input list, the resulting list will also be empty.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `filter_integers([])` is an empty list `[]`.
