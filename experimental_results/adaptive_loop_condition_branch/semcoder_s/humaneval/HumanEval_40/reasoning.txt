The function triples_sum_to_zero(l) takes a list of integers as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
In the innermost loop, for each pair of elements indexed by j and k in the inner loop, check if their sum equals to zero.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2 and 3.
    - l[i]=1: compare with 3, 5, 0:
        - When j = 1 (l[j]=3), k in the innermost loop is 2 and 3.
        - When k = 2 (l[k]=5), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When k = 3 (l[k]=0), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is True, the if branch is taken. Return True.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2 and 3.
    - l[i]=3: compare with 5, 0:
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=5), k in the innermost loop is 3.
        - When k = 3 (l[k]=0), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is True, the if branch is taken. Return True.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3.
    - l[i]=5: compare with 0:
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=0), k in the innermost loop is 3.
        - When k = 3 (l[k]=0), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is True, the if branch is taken. Return True.
Fourth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4.
    - l[i]=0: compare with 0:
        - When j = 4 (l[j]=0), k in the innermost loop is 4.
        - When k = 4 (l[k]=0), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is True, the if branch is taken. Return True.
