The function `remove_vowels` takes a string `text` as input and returns a new string with all vowels removed.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character `s` in the input text.
It checks if the lowercase version of the character `s` is not in the list of vowels ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"].
If the character is not a vowel, it is included in the new string.
Finally, the function joins the list of non-vowel characters to form the new string without vowels and returns it.

For the input 'fedcba', the function will remove the vowels and return 'fedcba' as there are no vowels in the input string.
