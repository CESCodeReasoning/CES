<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def remove_vowels(text):
    return "".join([s for s in text if s.lower() not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
remove_vowels('fedcba') 
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `remove_vowels` takes a string `text` as input and returns a new string with all vowels removed.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character `s` in the input text.
It checks if the lowercase version of the character `s` is not in the list of vowels ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"].
If the character is not a vowel, it is included in the new string.
Finally, the function joins the list of non-vowel characters to form the new string without vowels and returns it.

For the input 'fedcba', the function will remove the vowels and return 'fedcba' as there are no vowels in the input string.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def remove_vowels(text):
    return "".join([s for s in text if s.lower() not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]])
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
remove_vowels('fedcba')  # Output: 'fedcba'
[/OUTPUT]
