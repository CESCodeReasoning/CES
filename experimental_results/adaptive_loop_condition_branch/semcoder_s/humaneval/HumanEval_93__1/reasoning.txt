The function `encode` takes a message as input and performs the following operations:
1. It creates a dictionary `vowels_replace` that maps each vowel to its ASCII character after adding 2.
2. It swaps the case of all characters in the message.
3. It iterates over each character in the message and replaces it with its encoded value from the dictionary if it is a vowel, otherwise it keeps the character as it is.
4. Finally, it joins all the encoded characters together to form the encoded message and returns it.

For the input "I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE", the encoded message will be "Ig PtSg Vjg WpTs Tg Vjg WpTs".
