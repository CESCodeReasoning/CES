The function `find_max` takes a list of words as input and returns the word with the maximum length of unique characters. In case of a tie, it returns the word that comes first in lexicographical order.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `sorted` function is used to sort the list of words based on two criteria:
   - The first criteria is the length of the set of unique characters in descending order. This is achieved by `-len(set(x))`.
   - The second criteria is the lexicographical order of the words. This is achieved by `x`.
2. The sorted list is then indexed to get the first element, which is the word with the maximum length of unique characters and comes first in lexicographical order.

For the input `["name", "of", "string"]`, the sorted list based on the criteria mentioned above is `["name", "of", "string"]`. The first element is `"name"`, which is the word with the maximum length of unique characters and comes first in lexicographical order.
