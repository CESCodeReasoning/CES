The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string.
The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of integers from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
The `join` method is then used to concatenate the strings in the list with a space in between.
The list comprehension `[str(x) for x in range(n + 1)]` generates a list of strings where each string is the representation of an integer from 0 to `n`.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `string_sequence` on the input 3 is "0 1 2 3".
