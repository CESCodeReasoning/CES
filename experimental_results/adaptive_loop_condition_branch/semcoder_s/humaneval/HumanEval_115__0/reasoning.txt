The function `max_fill` takes a grid of integers and a capacity as input. It calculates the total number of full rows that can be filled using the given capacity by summing the ceiling of the division of the sum of each row by the capacity.

For the input `max_fill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2)`:
- The sums of each row are calculated: [2, 0, 4, 2].
- The division of each sum by the capacity (2) gives: [1.0, 0.0, 2.0, 1.0].
- The ceiling of each division result gives: [1, 0, 2, 1].
- The sum of these results gives: 5.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `max_fill` on the input `([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2)` is 5.
