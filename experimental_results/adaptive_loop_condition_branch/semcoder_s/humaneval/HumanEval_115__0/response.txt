<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
import math


def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    return sum([math.ceil(sum(arr) / capacity) for arr in grid])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
max_fill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2)
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `max_fill` takes a grid of integers and a capacity as input. It calculates the total number of full rows that can be filled using the given capacity by summing the ceiling of the division of the sum of each row by the capacity.

For the input `max_fill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2)`:
- The sums of each row are calculated: [2, 0, 4, 2].
- The division of each sum by the capacity (2) gives: [1.0, 0.0, 2.0, 1.0].
- The ceiling of each division result gives: [1, 0, 2, 1].
- The sum of these results gives: 5.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `max_fill` on the input `([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2)` is 5.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    return sum([math.ceil(sum(arr) / capacity) for arr in grid])
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
5
[/OUTPUT]
