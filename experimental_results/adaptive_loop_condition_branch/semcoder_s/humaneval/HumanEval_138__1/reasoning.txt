The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` takes an integer `n` as input and checks if `n` is even (i.e., `n % 2 == 0`) and greater than or equal to 8. If both conditions are true, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

To determine the output of executing the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` on the input 6, we need to check if 6 is both even and greater than or equal to 8.

Since 6 is both even (6 % 2 == 0) and greater than or equal to 8, the output of executing the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` on the input 6 is `True`.
