The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['271', '137', '314']).
Inside the function, an empty list `res` is initialized.
The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`.
First Iteration (arr = '271'):
    The sum of odd digits in '271' is calculated.
    The sum is 2 (7 and 1 are odd).
    The string 'the number of odd elements 2n the str2 of the 2nput.' is appended to `res`.
Second Iteration (arr = '137'):
    The sum of odd digits in '137' is calculated.
    The sum is 3 (1, 3 and 7 are odd).
    The string 'the number of odd elements 3n the str3 of the 3nput.' is appended to `res`.
Third Iteration (arr = '314'):
    The sum of odd digits in '314' is calculated.
    The sum is 3 (3, 1 and 4 are odd).
    The string 'the number of odd elements 3n the str3 of the 3nput.' is appended to `res`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the list `res`, which contains the strings 'the number of odd elements 2n the str2 of the 2nput.', 'the number of odd elements 3n the str3 of the 3nput.', 'the number of odd elements 3n the str3 of the 3nput.'.
