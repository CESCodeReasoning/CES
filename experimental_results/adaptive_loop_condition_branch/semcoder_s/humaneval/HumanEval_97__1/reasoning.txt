The function `multiply` takes two arguments `a` and `b`. It calculates the absolute value of the remainder of `a` divided by 10 (`abs(a % 10)`) and the absolute value of the remainder of `b` divided by 10 (`abs(b % 10)`). It then returns the product of these two values.

To determine the output of executing the function `multiply` on the inputs 76 and 67, we need to calculate the product of the last digits of 76 and 67.

- The last digit of 76 is 6 (`76 % 10 = 6`), and the last digit of 67 is 7 (`67 % 10 = 7`).
- The absolute values of these last digits are 6 and 7 respectively.
- The product of these absolute values is 6 * 7 = 42.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `multiply` on the inputs 76 and 67 is 42.
