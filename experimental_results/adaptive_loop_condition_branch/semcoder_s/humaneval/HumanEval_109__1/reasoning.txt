The function `move_one_ball` is called with ( arr = [3, 5, 4, 1, 2] ).

First Condition:
    - The length of the array is not 0, so we proceed to the next step.
Second Step:
    - The sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Third Step:
    - The minimum value in the array is 1, and its index is 3.
    - The new array becomes [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].
Fourth Step:
    - The loop iterates over the indices of the array.
    - The condition `my_arr[i] != sorted_array[i]` is checked for each index.
    - The first index where the condition is true is 2, so the function returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])` is False.
