The function `encrypt` is called with ( s = 'hi' ).
Inside the function, a variable `d` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
A variable `out` is initialized as an empty string.
The loop iterates over each character in the input string 'hi'.
First Iteration (c = 'h'):
   - The character 'h' is in the string `d`, so it gets encrypted.
   - The encrypted character is calculated as `d[(d.index(c)+2*2) % 26]`, which is 'j'.
   - 'j' is added to `out`.
Second Iteration (c = 'i'):
   - The character 'i' is in the string `d`, so it gets encrypted.
   - The encrypted character is calculated as `d[(d.index(c)+2*2) % 26]`, which is 'k'.
   - 'k' is added to `out`.
The encrypted string is 'jk'.
