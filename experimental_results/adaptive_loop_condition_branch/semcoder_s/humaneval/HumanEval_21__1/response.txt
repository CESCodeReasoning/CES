<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    min_number = min(numbers)
    max_number = max(numbers)
    return [(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number) for x in numbers]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
rescale_to_unit([2.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0])
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is rescaled to the range [0, 1] based on the minimum and maximum values in the input list.

1. Calculate the minimum and maximum values in the input list.
2. Subtract the minimum value from each number in the input list to shift the values to the positive side.
3. Divide each shifted number by the range of the input list to rescale it to the range [0, 1].

For the input list `[2.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0]`:
- The minimum value is `1.0`.
- The maximum value is `5.0`.
- The shifted values are `[2.0-1.0, 1.0-1.0, 5.0-1.0, 3.0-1.0, 4.0-1.0] = [1.0, 0.0, 4.0, 2.0, 3.0]`.
- The rescaled values are `[1.0/4.0, 0.0/4.0, 4.0/4.0, 2.0/4.0, 3.0/4.0] = [0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75]`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `rescale_to_unit` on the input list `[2.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0]` is `[0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75]`.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    min_number = min(numbers)  # ??
    max_number = max(numbers)  # ??
    return [(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number) for x in numbers]  # ??
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
[0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75]
[/OUTPUT]
