<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    smallest = list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, lst))
    largest = list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, lst))
    return (max(smallest) if smallest else None, min(largest) if largest else None)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]) 
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `largest_smallest_integers` takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer in the list.

- The function first filters out all negative numbers from the list and assigns them to the variable `smallest`.
- It then filters out all positive numbers from the list and assigns them to the variable `largest`.
- The function returns a tuple containing the maximum value from `smallest` if `smallest` is not empty, otherwise it returns `None`.
- Similarly, it returns a tuple containing the minimum value from `largest` if `largest` is not empty, otherwise it returns `None`.

For the input `[2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]`, the function will return `(None, 1)` because there are no negative numbers in the list and the smallest positive number is 1.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    smallest = list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, lst))  # Filters out negative numbers from the list
    largest = list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, lst))  # Filters out positive numbers from the list
    return (max(smallest) if smallest else None, min(largest) if largest else None)  # Returns a tuple with the largest negative number and smallest positive number
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7])  # Returns (None, 1)
[/OUTPUT]
