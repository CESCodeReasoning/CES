The function `largest_prime_factor` is called with ( n = 63 ).
Inside the function, a variable `largest` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 2 through 63 (since ( n = 63 )).
Iteration 1:
    -The number 2 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 3 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 3.
Iteration 5:
    -The number 5 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 5.
Iteration 7:
    -The number 7 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 7.
Iteration 11:
    -The number 11 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 11.
Iteration 13:
    -The number 13 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 13.
Iteration 17:
    -The number 17 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 17.
Iteration 19:
    -The number 19 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 19.
Iteration 23:
    -The number 23 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 23.
Iteration 29:
    -The number 29 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 29.
Iteration 31:
    -The number 31 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 31.
Iteration 37:
    -The number 37 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 37.
Iteration 41:
    -The number 41 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 41.
Iteration 43:
    -The number 43 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 43.
Iteration 47:
    -The number 47 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 47.
Iteration 53:
    -The number 53 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 53.
Iteration 59:
    -The number 59 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 59.
Iteration 61:
    -The number 61 is a factor of 63 and is prime, so largest becomes 61.

Therefore, the final output of the function `largest_prime_factor(63)` is 61.
