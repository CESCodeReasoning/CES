The function `next_smallest` takes a list of integers as input and returns the second smallest element in the list.

- The list `[5, 1, 4, 3, 2]` is sorted and converted to a set to remove duplicates, resulting in `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
- The sorted set is converted back to a list, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- The function checks if the length of the list is less than 2, which is False in this case.
- The function returns the element at index 1 of the list, which is `2`.
