The function `median` is called with ( l = [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20] ).
The list `l` is sorted to become [-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000].
The length of the list is 6, which is even.
The median is calculated as the average of the two middle elements: (10 + 20) / 2.0 = 15.0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])` is 15.0.
