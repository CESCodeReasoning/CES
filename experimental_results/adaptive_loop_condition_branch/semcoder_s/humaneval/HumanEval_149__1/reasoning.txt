The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted.
A new empty list `new_lst` is initialized.
The loop iterates over each element in the sorted `lst`.
Iteration 1:
    -The element 'AI' has an even length, so it is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 'asdf' has an even length, so it is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The element 'b' has an even length, so it is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 4:
    -The element 'school' has an even length, so it is appended to `new_lst`.
Finally, the function returns the sorted `new_lst` based on the length of the elements.
