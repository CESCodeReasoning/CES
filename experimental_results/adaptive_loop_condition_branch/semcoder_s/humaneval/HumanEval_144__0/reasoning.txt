The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "2/4", n = "8/4" ).
The function splits the input strings `x` and `n` by "/" resulting in `a=2`, `b=4`, `c=8`, `d=4`.
It then calculates the `numerator` as `2 * 8 = 16` and `denom` as `4 * 4 = 16`.
The condition `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` is checked.
Since `16 / 16 == 16 / 16`, the condition is true.
The function returns True.
