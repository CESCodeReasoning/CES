The function `minPath` takes a grid and a value `k` as input.
The function initializes a variable `val` to `n * n + 1`, where `n` is the length of the grid.
The function then iterates over each element in the grid.
If the element is 1, it checks the elements above, below, left, and right of it (if they exist) and stores the minimum value in `temp`.
Then, it updates `val` to the minimum value in `temp`.
After that, it initializes an empty list `ans`.
Then, it iterates `k` times, and for each iteration, it appends 1 to `ans` if the iteration is even, otherwise it appends `val` to `ans`.
Finally, it returns `ans`.
