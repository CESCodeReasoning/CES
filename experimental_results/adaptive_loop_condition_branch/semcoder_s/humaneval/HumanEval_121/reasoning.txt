The function `solution` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of elements at even indices in the list that are odd numbers.

- The list `[5, 8, 7, 1]` is given as input.
- The function iterates over the elements of the list along with their indices using `enumerate`.
- For the list `[5, 8, 7, 1]`, the elements and their indices are `(5, 0)`, `(8, 1)`, `(7, 2)`, `(1, 3)`.
- It checks if the index is even (`idx%2==0`) and the element is odd (`x%2==1`).
- For the given list, the elements at even indices that are odd are `5` and `1`.
- Therefore, the function returns the sum of `5` and `1`, which is `6`.
