<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def next_smallest(lst):
    lst = sorted(set(lst))
    return None if len(lst) < 2 else lst[1]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
next_smallest([])
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `next_smallest` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the second smallest element in the list.

- The list `lst` is sorted and duplicates are removed.
- If the length of the list is less than 2, the function returns `None` as there are not enough elements to find the second smallest one.
- Otherwise, the function returns the second element of the sorted list, which is the second smallest element in the original list.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def next_smallest(lst):
    lst = sorted(set(lst))  # [STATE]: The list is sorted and duplicates are removed. The sorted list is `lst`.
    return None if len(lst) < 2 else lst[1]  # [STATE]: The function returns the second element of the sorted list if the length of the list is at least 2. Otherwise, it returns `None`.
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
None
[/OUTPUT]
