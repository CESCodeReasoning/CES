The function `next_smallest` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the second smallest element in the list.

- The list `lst` is sorted and duplicates are removed.
- If the length of the list is less than 2, the function returns `None` as there are not enough elements to find the second smallest one.
- Otherwise, the function returns the second element of the sorted list, which is the second smallest element in the original list.
