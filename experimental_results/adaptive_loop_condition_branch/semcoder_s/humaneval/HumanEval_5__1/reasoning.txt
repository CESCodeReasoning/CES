The function `intersperse` is called with ( numbers = [2, 2, 2], delimeter = 2 ).
The condition `not numbers` is `False` since the list is not empty.
The `result` list is initialized as an empty list.
The loop iterates over all elements in `numbers` except the last one.
First Iteration (n = 2):
    - `result.append(n)` appends 2 to `result`, making `result = [2]`.
    - `result.append(delimeter)` appends 2 (delimeter) to `result`, making `result = [2, 2]`.
Second Iteration (n = 2):
    - `result.append(n)` appends 2 to `result`, making `result = [2, 2, 2]`.
    - `result.append(delimeter)` appends 2 (delimeter) to `result`, making `result = [2, 2, 2, 2]`.
After the loop completes, the last element (numbers[-1]) is appended to `result`, making `result = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`.
The function returns `result`, which is `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`.
