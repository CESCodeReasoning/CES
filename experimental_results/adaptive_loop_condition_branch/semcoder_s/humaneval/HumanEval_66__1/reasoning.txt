The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "aAaaaXa" ).
The condition `s == ""` is false, so we move to the return statement.
The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each character in the string "aAaaaXa".
For each character, if it is an uppercase letter, its ASCII value is returned, otherwise 0 is returned.
The sum of these values is calculated and returned.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digitSum("aAaaaXa")` is the sum of ASCII values of uppercase letters in the string "aAaaaXa", which is 0 (since there are no uppercase letters).
