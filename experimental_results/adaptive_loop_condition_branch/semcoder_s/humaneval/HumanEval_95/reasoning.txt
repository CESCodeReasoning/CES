The function `check_dict_case` is called with ( dict = {"p":"pineapple", "b":"banana"} ).
Inside the function, a variable `state` is initialized to "start".

Iteration 1:
    -The key 'p' is a string and is not uppercase, so `state` remains "start".
Iteration 2:
    -The key 'b' is a string and is not uppercase, so `state` remains "start".

The loop ends as there are no more keys to iterate over.

The function returns the result of the condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"`, which is `False` as `state` is still "start".
