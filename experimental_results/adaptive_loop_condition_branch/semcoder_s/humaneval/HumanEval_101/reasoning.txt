The function `words_string` is called with ( s = "Hi, my name is John" ).
Iteration 1:
    -The character 'H' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'i' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ',' is equal to ',', so a space is appended to s_list.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ' ' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 'm' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 6:
    -The character 'y' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ' ' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 8:
    -The character 'n' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 9:
    -The character 'a' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 10:
    -The character 'm' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 11:
    -The character 'e' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 12:
    -The character ' ' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 13:
    -The character 'i' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 14:
    -The character 's' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 15:
    -The character ' ' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 16:
    -The character 'J' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 17:
    -The character 'o' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 18:
    -The character 'h' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.
Iteration 19:
    -The character 'n' is not equal to ',', so it is appended to s_list.

Finally, s_list is joined and split by spaces, resulting in ['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John'].
