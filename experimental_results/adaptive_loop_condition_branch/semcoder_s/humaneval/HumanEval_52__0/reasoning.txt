The function `below_threshold` is called with ( l = [1, 8, 4, 10] , t = 11 ).
The function iterates over each element in the list.
First Iteration (e = 1)
   - `e` is 1, which is not greater than or equal to 11.
Second Iteration (e = 8)
   - `e` is 8, which is greater than 11.
   - The condition `e >= t` is false, so the function returns False.
