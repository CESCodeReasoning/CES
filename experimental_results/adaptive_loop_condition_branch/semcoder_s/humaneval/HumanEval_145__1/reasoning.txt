The function `order_by_points` is called with an empty list `[]`.
The function `digits_sum` is defined within `order_by_points` to calculate the sum of digits of a number.
The `sorted` function is used to sort the input list `nums` based on the sum of its digits calculated by `digits_sum`.
Since the input list is empty, the sorted list will also be empty.
