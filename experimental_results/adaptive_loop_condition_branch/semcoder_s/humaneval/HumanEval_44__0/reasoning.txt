The function `change_base` is called with ( x = 234, base = 2 ).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized as an empty string.
First Iteration:
    - x = 234, x % base = 0, ret = "0"
    - x //= base updates x to 117 ( 234 // 2 = 117 ).
Second Iteration:
    - x = 117, x % base = 1, ret = "10"
    - x //= base updates x to 58 ( 117 // 2 = 58 ).
Third Iteration:
    - x = 58, x % base = 0, ret = "010"
    - x //= base updates x to 29 ( 58 // 2 = 29 ).
Fourth Iteration:
    - x = 29, x % base = 1, ret = "110"
    - x //= base updates x to 14 ( 29 // 2 = 14 ).
Fifth Iteration:
    - x = 14, x % base = 0, ret = "0110"
    - x //= base updates x to 7 ( 14 // 2 = 7 ).
Sixth Iteration:
    - x = 7, x % base = 1, ret = "111"
    - x //= base updates x to 3 ( 7 // 2 = 3 ).
Seventh Iteration:
    - x = 3, x % base = 1, ret = "1011"
    - x //= base updates x to 1 ( 3 // 2 = 1 ).
Eighth Iteration:
    - x = 1, x % base = 1, ret = "11011"
    - x //= base updates x to 0 ( 1 // 2 = 0 ).
x is now 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `ret`, which is now "11011".
