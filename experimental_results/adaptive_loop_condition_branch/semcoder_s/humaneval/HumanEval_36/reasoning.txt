The function `fizz_buzz` is called with ( n = 50 ).
Inside the function, an empty list `ns` is initialized.
The loop iterates from 0 through 49 (since ( n = 50 )).
Iteration 0:
    - The condition `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` is true (since 0 is divisible by both 11 and 13).
    - Action: 0 is appended to `ns`.
Iteration 1:
    - The condition is false.
Iteration 2:
    - The condition is false.
...
Iteration 49:
    - The condition is true (since 49 is divisible by 11).
    - Action: 49 is appended to `ns`.
After the loop, `ns` contains [0, 11, 13, 22, 33, 44].
The list `ns` is converted to a string `s` using `map` and `join`, resulting in `s = '01113223344'`.
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
Iteration over each character in `s`:
    - The character '0' is not '7', so no change in `ans`.
    - The character '1' is not '7', so no change in `ans`.
    - The character '1' is not '7', so no change in `ans`.
    - The character '3' is not '7', so no change in `ans`.
    - The character '2' is not '7', so no change in `ans`.
