The function unique takes a list l as input and returns a new list that contains only unique elements from the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1], we need to remove duplicates from the input list.

1. Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates.
2. Convert the set back to a list to maintain the order of elements.
3. Sort the list to ensure the output list is in ascending order.

Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1] is [1, 2].
