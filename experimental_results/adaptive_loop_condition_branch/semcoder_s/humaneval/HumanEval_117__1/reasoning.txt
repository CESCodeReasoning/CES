The function select_words(s, n) takes a string `s` and an integer `n` as its parameters.
The function splits the string `s` into words and iterates through each word.
For each word, it counts the number of consonants.
If the number of consonants in a word is equal to `n`, it appends the word to the result list.
Finally, it returns the list of words that have exactly `n` consonants.

First Iteration (word="Mary"):
    - The word "Mary" has 2 consonants, so it is not appended to the result list.
Second Iteration (word="had"):
    - The word "had" has 1 consonant, so it is not appended to the result list.
Third Iteration (word="a"):
    - The word "a" has 0 consonants, so it is not appended to the result list.
Fourth Iteration (word="little"):
    - The word "little" has 3 consonants, so it is appended to the result list.
Fifth Iteration (word="lamb"):
    - The word "lamb" has 3 consonants, so it is appended to the result list.
