The function `do_algebra` is called with (operator = ['//', '*'], operand = [7, 3, 4]).
Inside the function, a variable `expression` is initialized to '7'.
The loop iterates over the operator and operand lists.
First Iteration (oprt = '//', oprn = 3):
    expression += '//' + str(3) updates `expression` to '7//3'.
Second Iteration (oprt = '*', oprn = 4):
    expression += '*' + str(4) updates `expression` to '7//3*4'.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `expression`, which is now '7//3*4'.

The `eval` function is used to evaluate the expression '7//3*4', which equals 2.
