The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['()(', ')'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `val` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `val` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `val` becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `val` becomes 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `val` becomes 0.

Since `val` is 0 after all characters are processed, the function returns 'Yes'.
