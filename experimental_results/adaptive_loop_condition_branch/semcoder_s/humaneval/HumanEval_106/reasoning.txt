The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
If the current number is even, calculate the factorial of the number and append it to the list ret.
If the current number is odd, calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to the current number and append it to the list ret.
First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, the condition `i%2 == 0` is False, so the else branch is taken.
    - `x` is initialized to 0, then for j in the range from 1 to 1 (i.e., no iteration as range(1, 1) is empty), x remains 0.
    - Append 0 to ret.
Second Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, the condition `i%2 == 0` is True, so the if branch is taken.
    - `x` is initialized to 1, then for j in the range from 1 to 2 (i.e., j=1), x is multiplied by 1.
    - Append 1 to ret.
Third Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, the condition `i%2 == 0` is False, so the else branch is taken.
    - `x` is initialized to 0, then for j in the range from 1 to 3 (i.e., j=1, 2), x is incremented by 1 and 2.
    - Append 3 to ret.
Fourth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, the condition `i%2 == 0` is True, so the if branch is taken.
    - `x` is initialized to 1, then for j in the range from 1 to 4 (i.e., j=1, 2, 3), x is multiplied by 1, 2, 6.
    - Append 6 to ret.
Fifth Iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, the condition `i%2 == 0` is False, so the else branch is taken.
    - `x` is initialized to 0, then for j in the range from 1 to 5 (i.e., j=1, 2, 3, 4), x is incremented by 1, 2, 3, 4.
    - Append 10 to ret.
