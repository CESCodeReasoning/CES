The function `generate_integers(a, b)` takes two parameters `a` and `b`. It first calculates the `lower` bound by taking the maximum of 2 and the minimum of `a` and `b`. It then calculates the `upper` bound by taking the minimum of 8 and the maximum of `a` and `b`.

Next, it generates a list of integers from `lower` to `upper` (inclusive) using a list comprehension. The condition `if i % 2 == 0` filters out odd numbers from the generated list.

Finally, it returns the filtered list of even integers.

Given the input `generate_integers(17, 89)`, the function will generate a list of even integers between 8 and 89 (inclusive) and return it.

Therefore, the output of `generate_integers(17, 89)` will be `[8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88]`.
