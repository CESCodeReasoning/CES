The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 12, shift = 1 ).
The variable `x` is 12, and `shift` is 1.
The function converts `x` to a string and stores it in `s`.
The condition `shift > len(s)` is checked. Since `shift` is 1 and `len(s)` is 2, the condition is false.
The `else` block is executed.
The function returns the result of `s[len(s) - shift:] + s[:len(s) - shift]`.
This means it returns the string `s` with the last character (`s[len(s) - shift:]`) moved to the front (`s[:len(s) - shift]`).

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(12, 1)` is '21'.
