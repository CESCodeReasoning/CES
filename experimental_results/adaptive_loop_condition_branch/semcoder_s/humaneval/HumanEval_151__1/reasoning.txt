The function `double_the_difference` takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the squares of all positive odd integers in the list that do not contain the decimal point.

- The list is empty, so there are no elements to iterate over.
- The sum of the squares of positive odd integers that do not contain the decimal point is 0.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `double_the_difference` on the empty list is 0.
