The function `change_base` is called with ( x = 8, base = 3 ).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized as an empty string.
First Iteration:
    - x = 8, x % base = 2, ret = "2" ( "2" + "" = "2" ).
    - x //= base updates x to 2 ( 8 // 3 = 2 ).
Second Iteration:
    - x = 2, x % base = 0, ret = "02" ( "0" + "2" = "02" ).
    - x //= base updates x to 0 ( 2 // 3 = 0 ).
The loop terminates as x is no longer greater than 0. The function returns the value of `ret`, which is now "02".
