The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a string `txt` as input and checks if the last character in the string is a letter.

- The function splits the input string `txt` by space and selects the last element using `split(' ')[-1]`. This gives us the last word in the string.
- It then checks if the length of the last word is 1 and if the ASCII value of the lowercase version of the last character falls within the range of lowercase letters (97 to 122).
- If both conditions are met, it returns `True`, indicating that the last character is a letter. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Now, let's determine the output of the function for the input "apple pi e ":
- The last word in the input string is "e".
- The length of the last word is 1.
- The ASCII value of 'e' is 101, which falls within the range of lowercase letters.
- Therefore, the function returns `True`.
