The function `count_nums` is called with ( arr = [1, 6, 9, -6, 0, 1, 5] ).
The inner function `digits_sum` is defined to calculate the sum of digits of a number.
The list comprehension `[digits_sum(i) for i in arr]` calculates the sum of digits for each number in the input list.
The `filter` function filters out the positive numbers from the list of sums.
The `len` function returns the count of positive numbers.

Therefore, the final output of the function `count_nums([1, 6, 9, -6, 0, 1, 5])` is 5.
