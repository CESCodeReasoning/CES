<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def sum_of_integer(N, K):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1): ## [STATE]i=??[/STATE][STATE]range(1,N+1)=??[/STATE][STATE]N+1=??[/STATE]
        sum += i
    if sum > K: ## [CONDITION](sum > K)=??[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return True
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return False
[/CODE]
[INPUT]
sum_of_integer(5, 10)
[/INPUT]

[ANSWER]
def sum_of_integer(N, K):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1): ## [STATE]i=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5][/STATE][STATE]range(1,N+1)=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5][/STATE][STATE]N+1=[6][/STATE]
        sum += i
    if sum > K: ## [CONDITION](sum > K)=[True] [/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return True
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return False
[/ANSWER]

[REASONING]
The function `sum_of_integer` is called with ( N = 5, K=10).
Inside the function, a variable `sum` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( N = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 3 ( 1 + 2 = 3 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 6 ( 3 + 3 = 6 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 10 ( 6 + 4 = 10 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
    `sum += i` updates `sum` to 15 ( 10 + 5 = 1 ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( sum > K ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `True` as the output.
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
True
[/OUTPUT]


[CODE]
def sum_elements(elements, K):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(elements)): ## [STATE]i=??[/STATE][STATE]len(elements)=??[/STATE][STATE]range(len(elements))=??[/STATE]
        total += elements[i]
    if total > K: ## [CONDITION](total > K)=??[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return True
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return False
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sum_elements([10, 20, 30, 40, 50], 100)
[/INPUT]


[REASONING]
The function `sum_elements` is called with ( elements = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], K = 100 ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 0 through 4 (since ( len(elements) = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    elements[i] = 10, `total += elements[i]` updates `total` to 1 ( 0 + 10 = 10 ).
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    elements[i] = 20, `total += elements[i]` updates `total` to 30 ( 10 + 20 = 30 ).
Third Iteration (i = 2)
    elements[i] = 30, `total += elements[i]` updates `total` to 60 ( 30 + 30 = 60 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
    elements[i] = 40, `total += elements[i]` updates `total` to 100 ( 60 + 40 = 100 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
    elements[i] = 50, `total += elements[i]` updates `total` to 150 ( 100 + 50 = 150 ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( total > K ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `True` as the output.

[INPUT]
rounded_avg(560,851)
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[SCRACHPAD]
[REASONING]
The function `rounded_avg` is called with ( n = 560, m = 851 ).
The condition `m < n` is not satisfied, so the else branch is taken.
The loop iterates from 560 through 851 (since ( n = 560, m = 851 )).
The summation of all numbers from 560 to 851 inclusive is calculated.
The average is calculated by dividing the summation by the count of numbers from 560 to 851 inclusive.
The average is then rounded and converted to binary representation.
The binary representation of the rounded average is returned.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if m < n: ## [CONDITION](m < n)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return -1
    summation = 0
    for i in range(n, m + 1): ## [STATE]i=[560, 561, ..., 851][/STATE][STATE]range(n, (m + 1))=[560, 561, ..., 851][/STATE][STATE]n=[560][/STATE][STATE](m + 1)=[852][/STATE]
        summation += i
    return bin(round(summation / (m - n + 1)))
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
'0b1010000001'
[/OUTPUT]
