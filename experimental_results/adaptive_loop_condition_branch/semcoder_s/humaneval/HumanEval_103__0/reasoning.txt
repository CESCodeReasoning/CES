The function `rounded_avg` is called with ( n = 560, m = 851 ).
The condition `m < n` is not satisfied, so the else branch is taken.
The loop iterates from 560 through 851 (since ( n = 560, m = 851 )).
The summation of all numbers from 560 to 851 inclusive is calculated.
The average is calculated by dividing the summation by the count of numbers from 560 to 851 inclusive.
The average is then rounded and converted to binary representation.
The binary representation of the rounded average is returned.
