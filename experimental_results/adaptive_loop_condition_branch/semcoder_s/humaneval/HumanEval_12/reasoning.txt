The function `longest` is called with ( strings = ['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc'] ).
The condition `not strings` is `False`, so we proceed to the next line.
The `maxlen` variable is assigned the maximum length of strings in the list, which is 4 in this case.
Iteration 1:
    -The string 'x' has a length of 1, which is not equal to `maxlen`.
Iteration 2:
    -The string 'yyy' has a length of 3, which is not equal to `maxlen`.
Iteration 3:
    -The string 'zzzz' has a length of 4, which is equal to `maxlen`.
    -The function returns 'zzzz'.
