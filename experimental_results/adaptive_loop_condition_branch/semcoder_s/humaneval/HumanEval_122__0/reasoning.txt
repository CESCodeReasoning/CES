The function `add_elements` takes two arguments: a list `arr` of integers and an integer `k`. It calculates the sum of the first `k` elements in the list `arr` that have a length of 1 or 2 digits.

- The first `k=4` elements of `arr` are `[111, 21, 3, 4000]`.
- The elements `111` and `21` are selected because they have 1 or 2 digits.
- The sum of these selected elements is `111 + 21 = 132`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `add_elements([111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], 4)` is `132`.
