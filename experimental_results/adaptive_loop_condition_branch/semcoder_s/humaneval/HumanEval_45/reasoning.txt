The function `triangle_area` calculates the area of a triangle given its base `a` and height `h`. The formula for calculating the area of a triangle is `1/2 * base * height`.
To calculate the area of a triangle with base 5 and height 3, we substitute these values into the formula: `1/2 * 5 * 3 = 7.5`.
