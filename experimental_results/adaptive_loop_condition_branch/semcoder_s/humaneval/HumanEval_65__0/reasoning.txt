The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 97, shift = 8 ).
The variable `s` is assigned the string representation of `x`, which is "97".
The condition `shift > len(s)` is checked. Since `shift = 8` and `len(s) = 2`, the condition is false.
Therefore, the `else` block is executed.
The function returns the result of `s[len(s) - shift:] + s[:len(s) - shift]`.
This is equivalent to `s[2-8:] + s[:2-8]` which is `s[0:] + s[:0]` which is `s + ""`.
Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(97, 8)` is "97".
