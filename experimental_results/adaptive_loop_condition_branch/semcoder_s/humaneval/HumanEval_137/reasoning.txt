The function `compare_one` is called with ( a = 1, b = 2 ).
Two temporary variables `temp_a` and `temp_b` are created and assigned the values of `a` and `b` respectively.
The condition checks if `temp_a` is a string. Since it's not, this condition is false.
The condition checks if `temp_b` is a string. Since it's not, this condition is false.
The condition checks if `temp_a` and `temp_b` are equal after converting them to floats. Since they are not equal, this condition is false.
The function returns `a` if `temp_a` is greater than `temp_b`, otherwise it returns `b`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one(1, 2)` is 2.
