The function `choose_num` is called with ( x = 12, y = 15 ).
First Condition ( x > y ) is not satisfied ( 12 > 15 )
Second Condition ( y % 2 == 0 ) is not satisfied ( 15 % 2 = 1 )
Third Condition ( x == y ) is not satisfied ( 12 == 15 )
Therefore, the function returns `y - 1`, which is `15 - 1 = 14`.
