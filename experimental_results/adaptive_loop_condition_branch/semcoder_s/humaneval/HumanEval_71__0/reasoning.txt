The function `triangle_area` is called with ( a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ).
The condition `a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a` is checked.
Since `1 + 2 <= 3` is False, the condition is not met.
The condition `b + c <= a` is checked.
Since `2 + 3 <= 1` is False, the condition is not met.
The condition `a + c <= b` is checked.
Since `1 + 3 <= 2` is False, the condition is not met.
The condition `a + b <= c` is checked.
Since `1 + 2 <= 3` is False, the condition is not met.
The condition is not met for any of the conditions, so the `if` block is not executed.
The semi-perimeter `s` is calculated as `(a + b + c) / 2 = 1.5`.
The area of the triangle is calculated using Heron's formula as `area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5`.
The area is then rounded to 2 decimal places using `area = round(area, 2)`.
The function returns the calculated area, which is `1.5`.
