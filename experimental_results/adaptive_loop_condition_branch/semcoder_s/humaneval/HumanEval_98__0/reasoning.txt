The function `count_upper` is called with ( s = 'dBBE' ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the characters of the string 'dBBE' with a step of 2.
Iteration 1:
    - The character at index 0 is 'd', which is not in "AEIOU".
Iteration 2:
    - The character at index 2 is 'B', which is not in "AEIOU".
Iteration 3:
    - The character at index 4 is 'E', which is not in "AEIOU".
The loop ends as it has iterated over all characters in the string.
The function returns the value of `count`, which is 0.
