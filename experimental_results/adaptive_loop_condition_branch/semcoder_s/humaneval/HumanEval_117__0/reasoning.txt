The function select_words(s, n) takes a string `s` and an integer `n` as its parameters.
The function splits the string `s` into words and iterates through each word.
For each word, it counts the number of consonants.
If the number of consonants in a word is equal to `n`, it appends the word to the result list.
Finally, it returns the list of words that have `n` consonants.

First Iteration (word="Hello"):
    - The word "Hello" has 3 consonants (H, l, l).
    - The condition `n_consonants == n` is False.
Second Iteration (word="world"):
    - The word "world" has 3 consonants (w, r, l).
    - The condition `n_consonants == n` is False.
