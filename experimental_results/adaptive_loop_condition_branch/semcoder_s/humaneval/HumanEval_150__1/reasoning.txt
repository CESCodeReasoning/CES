The function `x_or_y` is called with ( n = 91, x = 56, y = 129 ).

Iteration 1:
    -The condition `n == 1` is false.
Iteration 2:
    -The loop iterates from 2 to 90 (since n = 91).
    -For i = 2, 3, 4, ..., 34, 35, ..., 64, 65, ..., 90, the condition `n % i == 0` is false.
    -The loop continues until i = 90.
    -At the end of the loop, the `else` block is executed.
    -The function returns `x`, which is 56.

Therefore, the final output of the function `x_or_y(91, 56, 129)` is 56.
