The function `move_one_ball` is called with ( arr = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] ).
The function checks if the length of the array is 0.
If the length is 0, it returns True.
If the length is not 0, it sorts the array and stores it in `sorted_array`.
It then finds the minimum value in the array and its index.
It creates a new array `my_arr` by appending the elements from the index of the minimum value to the end of the array, followed by the elements from the beginning to the index of the minimum value.
The function then iterates over the array and checks if each element in `my_arr` is equal to the corresponding element in `sorted_array`.
If any element is not equal, it returns False.
If all elements are equal, it returns True.

For the input [3, 4, 5, 1, 2], the sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The minimum value is 1 at index 3.
The new array becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Since the new array is equal to the sorted array, the function returns True.
