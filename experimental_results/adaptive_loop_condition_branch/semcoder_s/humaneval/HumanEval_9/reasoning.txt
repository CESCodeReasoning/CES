The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [3,2,3,100,3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None and an empty list `result` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The current number is 3, so running_max is updated to 3.
    -The running maximum (3) is appended to the result list.
Iteration 2:
    -The current number is 2, which is less than the running maximum (3).
    -The running maximum remains 3.
    -The running maximum (3) is appended to the result list.
Iteration 3:
    -The current number is 3, which is equal to the running maximum (3).
    -The running maximum remains 3.
    -The running maximum (3) is appended to the result list.
Iteration 4:
    -The current number is 100, which is greater than the running maximum (3).
    -The running maximum is updated to 100.
    -The running maximum (100) is appended to the result list.
Iteration 5:
    -The current number is 3, which is less than the running maximum (100).
    -The running maximum remains 100.
    -The running maximum (100) is appended to the result list.

Therefore, the final output of the function `rolling_max([3,2,3,100,3])` is [3, 3, 3, 100, 100].
