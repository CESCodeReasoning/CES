The function `simplify` is called with ( x = "5/1", n = "3/1" ).
The function splits the input strings `x` and `n` by "/" resulting in `a=5`, `b=1`, `c=3`, `d=1`.
The numerator is calculated as `int(a) * int(c) = 5 * 3 = 15`.
The denominator is calculated as `int(b) * int(d) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
The condition `numerator / denom == int(numerator / denom)` is checked.
Since `15 / 1 == 15`, the condition is true and the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("5/1", "3/1")` is True.
