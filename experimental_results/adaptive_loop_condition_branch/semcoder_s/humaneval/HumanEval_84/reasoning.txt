The function `solve` takes an integer `N` as input and returns the binary representation of the sum of the digits of `N`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. Convert the integer `N` to a string to easily access each digit.
2. Convert each digit back to an integer and sum them up.
3. Convert the sum to binary using the `bin` function. The `[2:]` slice is used to remove the '0b' prefix from the binary representation.
4. Return the binary representation.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `solve` on the input `1000` is `'1001'`.
