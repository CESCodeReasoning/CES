The function `is_sorted` is called with ( lst = [3, 2, 1] ).
A dictionary `count_digit` is initialized with keys from `lst` and values as 0.
The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
First Iteration (i = 3):
    count_digit[3] is incremented by 1.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    count_digit[2] is incremented by 1.
Third Iteration (i = 1):
    count_digit[1] is incremented by 1.
After the loop completes, the condition `any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst)` is checked. Since all counts are less than or equal to 1, this condition is `False`.
The condition `all(lst[i - 1] <= lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst)))` is checked. This condition is `False` as 3 is greater than 2.
Therefore, the function returns `False` as the output.
