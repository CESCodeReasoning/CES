The function `intersection` is called with ( interval1 = (1, 2) , interval2 = (2, 3) ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is assigned the maximum value between the start of interval1 and interval2, and a variable `r` is assigned the minimum value between the end of interval1 and interval2.
The variable `length` is calculated as the difference between `r` and `l`.
The function `is_prime` is defined to check if a number is prime.
The condition `length > 0 and is_prime(length)` is checked.
   - If the length is greater than 0 and the length is a prime number, then "YES" is returned.
   - Otherwise, "NO" is returned.

In this case, the length is 1 (2 - 1), which is a prime number (2). Therefore, the function returns "YES".
