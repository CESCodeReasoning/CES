The function `is_multiply_prime(a)` is called with ( a = 3 * 6 * 7 ).
Inside the function, a nested function `is_prime(n)` is defined to check if a number is prime.
The outer loop iterates from 2 to 100 (since the range is 101).
The inner loops iterate from 2 to 100 (since the range is 101).
The innermost loop iterates from 2 to 100 (since the range is 101).
First Iteration (i = 2):
   - `i` is 2, which is a prime number.
   - The condition `not is_prime(i)` is False.
   - The inner loop starts with j = 2.
     - `j` is 2, which is a prime number.
     - The condition `not is_prime(j)` is False.
     - The innermost loop starts with k = 2.
       - `k` is 2, which is a prime number.
       - The condition `not is_prime(k)` is False.
       - The condition `i * j * k == a` is False.
       - The innermost loop continues with k = 3.
         - `k` is 3, which is a prime number.
         - The condition `not is_prime(k)` is False.
         - The condition `i * j * k == a` is False.
         - The innermost loop continues with k = 4.
           - `k` is 4, which is not a prime number.
           - The condition `not is_prime(k)` is True.
           - The innermost loop continues with k = 5.
             - `k` is 5, which is a prime number.
             - The condition `not is_prime(k)` is False.
             - The condition `i * j * k == a` is False.
             - The innermost loop continues with k = 6.
               - `k` is 6, which is not a prime number.
               - The condition `not is_prime(k)` is True.
               - The innermost loop continues with k = 7.
                 - `k` is 7, which is a prime number.
                 - The condition `not is_prime(k)` is False.
                 - The condition `i * j * k == a` is True.
                 - The function returns True.
