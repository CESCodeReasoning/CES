The function triples_sum_to_zero(l) takes a list of integers as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
In the innermost loop, for each pair of elements indexed by j and k in the inner loop, check if their sum equals 0.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - For each j, compare with every element that comes after it in the list.
    - For j = 1 (l[j]=4), k in the innermost loop is 2, 3, 4, 5.
    - For each k, check if l[i] + l[j] + l[k] equals 0.
    - When k = 2 (l[k]=-5), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When k = 3 (l[k]=3), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When k = 4 (l[k]=9), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When k = 5 (l[k]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - For each j, compare with every element that comes after it in the list.
    - For j = 2 (l[j]=-5), k in the innermost loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - For each k, check if l[i] + l[j] + l[k] equals 0.
    - When k = 3 (l[k]=3), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When k = 4 (l[k]=9), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When k = 5 (l[k]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
    - For each j, compare with every element that comes after it in the list.
    - For j = 3 (l[j]=3), k in the innermost loop is 4, 5.
    - For each k, check if l[i] + l[j] + l[k] equals 0.
    - When k = 4 (l[k]=9), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When k = 5 (l[k]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
    - For each j, compare with every element that comes after it in the list.
    - For j = 4 (l[j]=9), k in the innermost loop is 5.
    - For each k, check if l[i] + l[j] + l[k] equals 0.
    - When k = 5 (l[k]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - For each j, compare with every element that comes after it in the list.
    - For j = 5 (l[j]=7), k in the innermost loop is 5.
    - For each k, check if l[i] + l[j] + l[k] equals 0.
    - When k = 5 (l[k]=7), the condition `l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.
