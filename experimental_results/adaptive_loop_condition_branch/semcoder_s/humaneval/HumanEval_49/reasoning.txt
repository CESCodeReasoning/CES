The function `modp` is called with (n = 3, p = 5).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates 3 times (since n = 3).
First Iteration (i = 0):
    `ret = (2 * 1) % 5` updates `ret` to 2 ( 1 * 2 % 5 = 2 ).
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    `ret = (2 * 2) % 5` updates `ret` to 4 ( 2 * 2 % 5 = 4 ).
Third Iteration (i = 2)
    `ret = (2 * 4) % 5` updates `ret` to 2 ( 4 * 2 % 5 = 2 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ret`, which is now 2.
