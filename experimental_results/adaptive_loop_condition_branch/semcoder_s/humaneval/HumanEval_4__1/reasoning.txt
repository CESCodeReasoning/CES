The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers.

1. Calculate the mean of the numbers by summing all the numbers and dividing by the total number of elements.
2. Calculate the absolute deviation for each number by subtracting the mean and taking the absolute value.
3. Sum up all the absolute deviations and divide by the total number of elements to get the mean absolute deviation.

For the input `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]`:
- The mean is calculated as `(1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0 + 4.0 + 5.0) / 5.0 = 3.0`.
- The absolute deviations are calculated as `abs(1.0 - 3.0) = 2.0`, `abs(2.0 - 3.0) = 1.0`, `abs(3.0 - 3.0) = 0.0`, `abs(4.0 - 3.0) = 1.0`, `abs(5.0 - 3.0) = 2.0`.
- The sum of absolute deviations is `2.0 + 1.0 + 0.0 + 1.0 + 2.0 = 6.0`.
- The mean absolute deviation is `6.0 / 5.0 = 1.2`.

Therefore, the output of `mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])` is `1.2`.
