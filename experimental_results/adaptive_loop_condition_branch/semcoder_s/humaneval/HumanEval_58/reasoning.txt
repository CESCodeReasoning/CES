The function common(l1, l2) takes two lists, l1 and l2, as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each element in l1 to compare it against the elements in l2.
In the inner loop, for each element e1 in l1, compare it with every element e2 in l2.
First Iteration:
    - e1=1, e2 in l2=[5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]
    - When e2 = 5, the condition e1 == e2 is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When e2 = 7, the condition e1 == e2 is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When e2 = 1, the condition e1 == e2 is True, the if branch is taken. Add 1 to ret.
    - When e2 = 5, the condition e1 == e2 is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When e2 = 9, the condition e1 == e2 is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When e2 = 653, the condition e1 == e2 is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When e2 = 121, the condition e1 == e2 is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration:

    - When e2 = 7, the condition e1 == e2 is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When e2 = 1, the condition e1 == e2 is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When e2 = 5, the condition e1 == e2 is False, the if branch is not taken.

    - When e2 = 5, the condition e1 == e2 is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When e2 = 9, the condition e1 == e2 is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When e2 = 653, the condition e1 == e2 is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - When e2 = 121, the condition e1 == e2 is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration:
    - e1=653, e2 in l2=[5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]
    - When e2 = 5, the condition e1 == e2 is False, the if branch is not taken.
