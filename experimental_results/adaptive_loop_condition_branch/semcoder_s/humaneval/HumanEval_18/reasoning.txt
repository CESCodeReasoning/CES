The function `how_many_times` is called with ( string = '', substring = 'x' ).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0.

The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `len(string) - len(substring) + 1`, which is `range(0, 1)`.

Since the length of the string is 0 and the length of the substring is 1, the loop does not execute as there are no characters to check for the substring 'x'.

Therefore, the function returns the value of `times`, which is 0.
