The function `compare_one` is called with ( a = "1", b = "2" ).
Two temporary variables `temp_a` and `temp_b` are created and assigned the values of `a` and `b` respectively.
Checking if `temp_a` is a string:
   - The condition `isinstance(temp_a, str)` is true (as "1" is a string).
   - Action: `temp_a` is updated to "1" after replacing ',' with '.'.
Checking if `temp_b` is a string:
   - The condition `isinstance(temp_b, str)` is true (as "2" is a string).
   - Action: `temp_b` is updated to "2" after replacing ',' with '.'.
Comparing the float values of `temp_a` and `temp_b`:
   - The condition `float(temp_a) == float(temp_b)` is false (as 1.0 != 2.0).
   - Since the condition is false, the function returns `a` if `temp_a` is greater than `temp_b`, which is not the case here.

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one("1", "2")` is "1".
