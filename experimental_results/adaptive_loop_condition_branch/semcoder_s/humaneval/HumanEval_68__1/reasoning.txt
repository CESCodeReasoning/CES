The function `pluck` is called with ( arr = [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2] ).
First, we check if the length of the array `arr` is 0.
   - The length of `arr` is 6, so this condition is false.
Next, we filter the even numbers from the array using a lambda function and store them in `evens`.
   - The even numbers in `arr` are 0, 0, 4, 2, so `evens` becomes [0, 0, 4, 2].
Then, we check if `evens` is an empty list.
   - `evens` is not an empty list, so this condition is false.
Finally, we return a list containing the minimum value from `evens` and its index in the original array.
   - The minimum value in `evens` is 0, and its index in `arr` is 1.
Therefore, the final output of the function `pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])` is [0, 1].
