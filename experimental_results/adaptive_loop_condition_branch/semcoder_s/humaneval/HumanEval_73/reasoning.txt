The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the first half of the array.
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - The condition `arr[0] != arr[len(arr) - 0 - 1]` checks if the first element (1) is not equal to the last element (6).
   - Since they are not equal, `ans` is incremented by 1.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - The condition `arr[1] != arr[len(arr) - 1 - 1]` checks if the second element (2) is not equal to the second last element (5).
   - Since they are not equal, `ans` is incremented by 1.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - The condition `arr[2] != arr[len(arr) - 2 - 1]` checks if the third element (3) is not equal to the third last element (4).
   - Since they are not equal, `ans` is incremented by 1.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - The condition `arr[3] != arr[len(arr) - 3 - 1]` checks if the fourth element (5) is not equal to the fourth last element (7).
   - Since they are equal, `ans` remains unchanged.
The loop ends here.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is now 3.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6])` is 3.
