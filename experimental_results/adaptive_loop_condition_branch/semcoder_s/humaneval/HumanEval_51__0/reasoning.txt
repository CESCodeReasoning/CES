The function `remove_vowels` takes a string `text` as input and returns a new string with all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) removed.

- The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character `s` in the input `text`.
- It checks if the lowercase version of the character `s` is not in the list of vowels.
- If the character is not a vowel, it is included in the new string.
- If the character is a vowel, it is not included in the new string.
- The function then joins all the non-vowel characters together to form the new string.

Since the input is an empty string, there are no vowels to remove, so the output will be an empty string as well.
