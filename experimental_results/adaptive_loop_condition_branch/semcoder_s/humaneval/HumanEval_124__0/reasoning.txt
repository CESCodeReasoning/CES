The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '01-01-2007' ).
The date is stripped of leading and trailing whitespaces.
The date is then split into month, day, and year parts.
The month, day, and year are converted to integers.
The function checks if the month is less than 1 or greater than 12. If it is, the function returns False.
The function checks if the day is not within the valid range for the given month. If it is not, the function returns False.
The function checks if the month is February and the day is not within the valid range for February. If it is not, the function returns False.
If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns True, indicating a valid date.
