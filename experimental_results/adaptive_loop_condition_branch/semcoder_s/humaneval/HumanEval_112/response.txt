<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def reverse_delete(s,c):
    s = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in c])
    return (s,s[::-1] == s)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
reverse_delete("abcde","ae") 
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `reverse_delete` takes two arguments `s` and `c`. `s` is a string and `c` is a string of characters to be removed from `s`.

- The function first creates a new string by iterating over each character in `s` and only keeping characters that are not in `c`. This is done using a list comprehension and the `join` method to convert the list back into a string.
- The function then checks if the reversed string is equal to the original string. If they are equal, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Given the input `reverse_delete("abcde","ae")`, the function will remove the characters 'a' and 'e' from the string "abcde", resulting in "bcd". Then it will check if the reversed string "dcb" is equal to the original string "bcd", which is `False`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `reverse_delete("abcde","ae")` is `("bcd", False)`.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def reverse_delete(s,c):
    s = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in c])
    return (s,s[::-1] == s)
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
("bcd", False)
[/OUTPUT]
