The function `is_simple_power` is called with ( x = 128, n = 4 ).
The condition `(n == 1)` is checked. Since `n` is not equal to 1, the if branch is not taken.
The loop iterates until `power` is greater than or equal to `x`.
First Iteration (power = 1):
    - power * n = 1 * 4 = 4
Second Iteration (power = 4):
    - power * n = 4 * 4 = 16
Third Iteration (power = 16):
    - power * n = 16 * 4 = 64
Fourth Iteration (power = 64):
    - power * n = 64 * 4 = 256
Fifth Iteration (power = 256):
    - power * n = 256 * 4 = 1024
After the loop completes, `power` is equal to `x`, so the function returns `True`.
