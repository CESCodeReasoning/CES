The function `histogram` is called with ( test = 'b b b b a' ).
Inside the function, a dictionary `dict1` is initialized.
The input string is split into a list of words: `['b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'a']`.

Iteration 1:
    - The word 'b' appears 4 times, which is greater than the current maximum frequency `t` (which is initially 0).
    - Update `t` to 4.
Iteration 2:
    - The word 'a' appears 1 time, which is not greater than the current maximum frequency `t` (which is 4).
    - No update is made to `t`.

Since `t` is 4, the condition `t > 0` is true.
Iteration 3:
    - The word 'b' appears 4 times, which is equal to the current maximum frequency `t`.
    - Add 'b' to the dictionary `dict1` with a frequency of 4.

The final dictionary `dict1` is `{'b': 4}`.
