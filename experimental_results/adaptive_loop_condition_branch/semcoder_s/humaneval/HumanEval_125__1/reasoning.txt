The function `split_words` is called with ( txt = "Hello world,!" ).
The condition `" " in txt` is False, the first branch is not taken.
The condition `"," in txt` is True, the second branch is taken.
The `txt.replace(',', ' ')` replaces the comma with a space, resulting in "Hello world !".
The `split()` method splits the string into a list of words, resulting in `["Hello", "world", "!"]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `split_words("Hello world,!")` is `["Hello", "world", "!"]`.
