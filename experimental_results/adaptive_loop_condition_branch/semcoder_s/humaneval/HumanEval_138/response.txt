<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    return n%2 == 0 and n >= 8
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
is_equal_to_sum_even(4) 
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` takes an integer `n` as input and checks if `n` is even (i.e., `n % 2 == 0`) and greater than or equal to 8. If both conditions are true, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

To determine the output of executing the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` on the input 4, we need to check if 4 is both even and greater than or equal to 8.

Since 4 is even (4 % 2 == 0), but not greater than or equal to 8, the function will return `False`.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    return n%2 == 0 and n >= 8
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
False
[/OUTPUT]
