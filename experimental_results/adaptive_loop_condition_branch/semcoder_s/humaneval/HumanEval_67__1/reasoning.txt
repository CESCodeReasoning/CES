The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "5 apples and 6 oranges", n = 21 ).
Inside the function, a list `lis` is initialized.
The loop iterates over each word in the string after splitting it by space.
First Iteration (i = "5"):
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is true for "5".
   - Action: "5" is converted to an integer and appended to `lis`.
Second Iteration (i = "apples"):
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false for "apples".
   - Action: "apples" is not added to `lis`.
Third Iteration (i = "and"):
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false for "and".
   - Action: "and" is not added to `lis`.
Fourth Iteration (i = "6"):
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is true for "6".
   - Action: "6" is converted to an integer and appended to `lis`.
Fifth Iteration (i = "oranges"):
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false for "oranges".
   - Action: "oranges" is not added to `lis`.
After the loop, the function returns the difference between `n` and the sum of the elements in `lis`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges",21)` is 21 - (5 + 6) = 21 - 11 = 10.
