The function `parse_nested_parens` is called with ( paren_string = '((()))' ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_depth` is initialized to 0.
The `parse_paren_group` function is defined to calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses.
The `for` loop iterates over each character in the input string.
First Iteration (Character '('):
   - The character '(' is encountered, so `depth` is incremented to 1 and `max_depth` is updated to 1.
Second Iteration (Character '('):
   - The character '(' is encountered, so `depth` is incremented to 2 and `max_depth` remains 1.
Third Iteration (Character ')'):
   - The character ')' is encountered, so `depth` is decremented to 1.
Fourth Iteration (Character '('):
   - The character '(' is encountered, so `depth` is incremented to 2 and `max_depth` is updated to 2.
Fifth Iteration (Character ')'):
   - The character ')' is encountered, so `depth` is decremented to 1.
Sixth Iteration (Character ')'):
   - The character ')' is encountered, so `depth` is decremented to 0.
The loop ends, and the function returns `max_depth`, which is 2.
