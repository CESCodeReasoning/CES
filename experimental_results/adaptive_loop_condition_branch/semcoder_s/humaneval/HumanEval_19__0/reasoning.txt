The function `sort_numbers` takes a string of space-separated numbers in words as input and returns the numbers sorted in numerical order.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. A dictionary `value_map` is created to map the word numbers to their corresponding numerical values.
2. The input string is split by space and filtered to remove any empty strings.
3. The list of numbers is sorted based on the corresponding numerical value of each word number using the `sorted` function and a lambda function as the key.
4. The sorted list of numbers is joined back into a string with spaces and returned as the output.

Since the input string is empty, the output will also be an empty string.
