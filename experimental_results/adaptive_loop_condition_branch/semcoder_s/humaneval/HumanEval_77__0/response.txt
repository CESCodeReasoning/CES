<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def iscube(a):
    a = abs(a)
    return int(round(a ** (1. / 3))) ** 3 == a
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
iscube(2)
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `iscube(a)` checks if a number is a cube of an integer.

- The function first takes the absolute value of the input number `a`.
- It then calculates the cube root of `a` by cubing the result of rounding `a` to the nearest third power.
- It checks if the cube of this cube root is equal to `a`.
- If the above condition is true, it returns `True`, indicating that `a` is a cube of an integer. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

For the input `2`, the absolute value of `2` is `2`. The cube root of `2` is `round(2 ** (1. / 3))` which is `round(1.2599210498948732)` which is `1`. The cube of `1` is `1`, which is not equal to `2`. Therefore, the function returns `False`.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def iscube(a: Union[int, float]) -> bool:
    a = abs(a)  # [STATE]: The absolute value of the input number `a` is calculated.
    return int(round(a ** (1. / 3))) ** 3 == a  # [CONDITION]: The condition `int(round(a ** (1. / 3))) ** 3 == a` is checked.
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
False
[/OUTPUT]
