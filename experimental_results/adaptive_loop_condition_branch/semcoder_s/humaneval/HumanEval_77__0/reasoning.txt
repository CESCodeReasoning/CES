The function `iscube(a)` checks if a number is a cube of an integer.

- The function first takes the absolute value of the input number `a`.
- It then calculates the cube root of `a` by cubing the result of rounding `a` to the nearest third power.
- It checks if the cube of this cube root is equal to `a`.
- If the above condition is true, it returns `True`, indicating that `a` is a cube of an integer. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

For the input `2`, the absolute value of `2` is `2`. The cube root of `2` is `round(2 ** (1. / 3))` which is `round(1.2599210498948732)` which is `1`. The cube of `1` is `1`, which is not equal to `2`. Therefore, the function returns `False`.
