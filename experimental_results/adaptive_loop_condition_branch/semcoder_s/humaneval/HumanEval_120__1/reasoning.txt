The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [123, -123, 20, 0 , 1, 2, -3] , k = 3 ).
The condition `k == 0` is false (since k = 3).
The `if` condition is skipped.
The `arr.sort()` method is called, sorting the array `[123, -123, 20, 0 , 1, 2, -3]` to `[-123, -3, 0, 1, 2, 20, 123]`.
The last `k = 3` elements are selected from the sorted array, resulting in `[20, 123, 1]`.
The function returns this list.

Therefore, the final output of the function `maximum([123, -123, 20, 0 , 1, 2, -3], 3)` is `[20, 123, 1]`.
