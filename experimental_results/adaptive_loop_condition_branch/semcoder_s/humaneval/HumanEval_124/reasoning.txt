The function `valid_date` is called with ( date = '03-11-2000' ).
The date is stripped of leading and trailing whitespaces.
The date is split into month, day, and year parts.
The month, day, and year are converted to integers.
The month is checked to be within the range of 1 to 12.
If the month is not in the range, the function returns False.
If the month is in [1,3,5,7,8,10,12], it checks if the day is within the range of 1 to 31.
If the day is not within the range, the function returns False.
If the month is in [4,6,9,11], it checks if the day is within the range of 1 to 30.
If the day is not within the range, the function returns False.
If the month is 2, it checks if the day is within the range of 1 to 29.
If the day is not within the range, the function returns False.
If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('03-11-2000')` is True.
