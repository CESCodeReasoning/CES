The function `sum_to_n` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive.
To determine the output of executing the function `sum_to_n` on the input 6, we need to calculate the sum of numbers from 0 to 6.
0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21
Therefore, the output of executing the function `sum_to_n` on the input 6 is 21.
