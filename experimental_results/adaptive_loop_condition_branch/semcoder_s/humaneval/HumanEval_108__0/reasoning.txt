The function `count_nums` is called with ( arr = [1] ).
Inside the function, a nested function `digits_sum` is defined to calculate the sum of digits of a number.
The outer function iterates over the elements of the input list `arr`.
For the first element (i = 1), the `digits_sum` function is called.
   - The condition `n < 0` is not met (as 1 is not less than 0).
   - The number is converted to a list of digits: [1].
   - The first digit is multiplied by the negative sign (as it's not negative), resulting in [1].
   - The sum of digits is calculated: 1.
   - The condition `x > 0` is true (as 1 is greater than 0).
   - The count is incremented by 1.
After iterating over all elements, the function returns the count, which is 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `count_nums([1])` is 1.
