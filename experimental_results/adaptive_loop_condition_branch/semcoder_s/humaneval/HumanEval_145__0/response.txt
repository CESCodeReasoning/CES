<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def sum_of_integer(N):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1): ## [STATE]i=??[/STATE][STATE]range(1,N+1)=??[/STATE][STATE]N+1=??[/STATE]

            sum_1 += 1
        elif i < 5: ## [CONDITION](i<5)=??[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
            sum_1+= 2
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
	        sum_1 *= 4
    return sum_1
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sum_of_integer(5)
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function `sum_of_integer` is called with ( N = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `sum_1` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( N = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which satisfies ( 1 <= i < 3 ).
   - The condition `i >= 1 and i < 3` is true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 1` results in `sum_1 = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which still satisfies ( 1 <=i < 3 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 1` updates `sum_1` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which now satisfies ( 3 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `i < 5` is true (while the first condition `i >= 1 and i < 3` is false).
   - Action: `sum_1 += 2` updates `sum_1` to 4 (`2 + 2 = 4`).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, also satisfying ( 3 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `i < 5` is still true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 2` updates `sum_1` to 6 (`4 + 2 = 6`).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, now outside the previous conditions, falling into the `else` block.
   - The `else` block's action: `sum_1 *= 4` updates `sum_1` to 24 (`6 * 4 = 24`).
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `sum_1`, which is now 24.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_of_integer(5)` is 24.

    return sum_1
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
24
[/OUTPUT]

[CODE]
def check_integer(i)
    if i >= 1 and i <3: ## [CONDITION](i>=1) = ??[/CONDITION][CONDITION](i <3) = ??[/CONDITION][CONDITION](i >= 1 and i <3)=??[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return True
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return False
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
check_integer(2)
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function `check_integer` is called with ( i = 2 ).
`i` is 2, which satisfies ( 1 <= i < 3 ).
The condition `i >= 1` and `i < 3` is true, therefore the if branch is taken and the method returns True

Therefore, the final output of the function `check_integer(2)` is True.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def check_integer(i)
    if i >= 1 and i <3: ## [CONDITION](i>=1) = [True][/CONDITION][CONDITION](i <3) = [True][/CONDITION][CONDITION](i >= 1 and i <3)=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return True
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return False

[OUTPUT]
True

[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[SCRACHPAD]
[REASONING]
The function `order_by_points` takes a list of integers as input and sorts them based on the sum of their digits.

The helper function `digits_sum` calculates the sum of the digits of a number.

For each number in the input list, the `digits_sum` function is applied to calculate the sum of its digits. The numbers are then sorted based on these sums.

The sorted list is then returned as the output.
[/REASONING]

            n, neg = -1 * n, -1
        n = [int(i) for i in str(n)]
        n[0] = n[0] * neg
        return sum(n)
    return sorted(nums, key=digits_sum)
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
[0, 2, 3, 56, 6, 37, 423, 423, 423, 1234, 145, 3457, 46, 463, 53]
