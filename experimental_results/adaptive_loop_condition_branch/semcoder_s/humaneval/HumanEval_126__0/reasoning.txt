The function `is_sorted` is called with ( lst = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
A dictionary `count_digit` is initialized with keys from `lst` and values as 0.
The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
First Iteration (i = 1):
    count_digit[1] is incremented by 1.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    count_digit[2] is incremented by 1.
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    count_digit[3] is incremented by 1.
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
    count_digit[4] is incremented by 1.
After the loop completes, the condition `any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst)` is not satisfied as all counts are less than or equal to 1.
The condition `all(lst[i - 1] <= lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst)))` is satisfied as the list is sorted in ascending order.
Therefore, the if branch is taken and the function returns `True` as the output.
