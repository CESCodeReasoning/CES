The function `sort_array` takes an array `arr` as input and returns the array sorted in ascending order. The array is sorted first based on the natural order, and then based on the number of 1's in the binary representation of each element.

To determine the output of executing the function `sort_array` on the input `[]` (an empty array), we need to sort an empty array. Since the array is empty, the output will be an empty array.
