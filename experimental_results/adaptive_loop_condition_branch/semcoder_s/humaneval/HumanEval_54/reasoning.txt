The function `same_chars` takes two strings `s0` and `s1` as input and returns `True` if the characters in `s0` and `s1` are the same, ignoring the order and duplicates.

To determine the output of executing the function `same_chars` on the input `'eabcdzzzz'` and `'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc'`, we need to compare the unique characters in both strings while ignoring duplicates and the order.

- The unique characters in `'eabcdzzzz'` are `'eabcdz'`.
- The unique characters in `'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc'` are `'dedabz'`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `same_chars` on the input `'eabcdzzzz'` and `'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc'` is `False`.
