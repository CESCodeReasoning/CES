The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['())(', '()'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `val` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `val` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `val` becomes 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `val` becomes 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `val` becomes 0.

The function returns 'Yes' because the final value of `val` is 0, which means the parentheses are balanced.
