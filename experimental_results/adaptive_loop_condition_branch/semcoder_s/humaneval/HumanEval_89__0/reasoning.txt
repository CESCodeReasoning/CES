The function `encrypt` is called with ( s = 'et' ).
Inside the function, a variable `d` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
A variable `out` is initialized as an empty string.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'e' is in `d`, so it is encrypted by shifting 2 places to the right.
    -The encrypted character is 'g'.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 't' is in `d`, so it is encrypted by shifting 2 places to the right.
    -The encrypted character is 'v'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `encrypt('et')` is 'gv'.
