The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [0] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `result` is initialized.
The loop iterates over the indices of the input list `[0]`.
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true (since 0 is divisible by 3).
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` appends the square of the element at index 0 (0**2 = 0) to `result`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the sum of the elements in `result`, which is 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_squares([0])` is 0.
