The function `sum_product` is called with an empty list `[]`.
Inside the function, two variables `sum_value` and `prod_value` are initialized to 0 and 1 respectively.
Since the input list is empty, the loop does not execute.
The function returns a tuple containing `sum_value` and `prod_value`, which are both 0 and 1 respectively.
