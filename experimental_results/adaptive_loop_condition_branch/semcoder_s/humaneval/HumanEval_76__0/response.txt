<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def sum_up_to_n(n, k):
    total = 0
    current_number = 1
    while current_number <= n: ## [STATE]current_number=??[/STATE][STATE]n=??[/STATE]
        total += current_number
        current_number += 1
    if total > k: ## [CONDITION](sum > k)=??[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return True
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return False
    return total
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sum_up_to_n(5, 10)
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function `sum_up_to_n` is called with ( n = 5, k = 10 ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( n = 5 )).
First Iteration (current_number = 1):
    - current_number <= 5 when current_number=1
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (current_number = 2):
    - current_number <= 5 when current_number=2
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 3 ( 1 + 2 = 3 ).
Third Iteration (current_number = 3)
    - current_number <= 5 when current_number=3
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 6 ( 3 + 3 = 6 ).
Fourth Iteration (current_number = 4)
    -current_number <= 5 when current_number=4
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 10 ( 6 + 4 = 10 ).
Fifth Iteration (current_number = 5)
    -   current_number <= 5 when current_number=5
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 15 ( 10 + 5 = 15 ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( total > k ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `True` as the output.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def sum_up_to_n(n):
    total = 0
    current_number = 1
    while current_number <= n: ## [STATE]current_number=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5][/STATE][STATE]n=[5][/STATE]
        total += current_number
        current_number += 1
    if total > k: ## [CONDITION](sum > k)=??[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return True
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return False
    return total
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
True
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def is_simple_power(x, n):
    if (n == 1): ## [CONDITION](n == 1)=??[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return (x == 1)
    power = 1
    while (power < x): ## [STATE](power < x)=??[/STATE][STATE]power=??[/STATE][STATE]x=??[/STATE]
        power = power * n
    return (power == x)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
is_simple_power(1, 1)
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
