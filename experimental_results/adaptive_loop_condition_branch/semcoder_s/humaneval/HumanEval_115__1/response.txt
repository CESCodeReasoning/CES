<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
import math


def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    return sum([math.ceil(sum(arr) / capacity) for arr in grid])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
max_fill([[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], 2)
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `max_fill` calculates the maximum number of times a bucket can be filled with water such that the total amount of water does not exceed the capacity of the bucket.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The function takes a 2D list `grid` representing the amount of water in each glass and an integer `capacity` representing the capacity of the bucket.
2. It calculates the total amount of water in each row using `sum(arr)` for each row `arr` in the `grid`.
3. It divides the total amount of water in each row by the `capacity` to get the quantity of water that can be filled in one fill operation.
4. It rounds up the result of the division using `math.ceil()` to ensure that at least one fill operation is performed if the total water is less than the capacity.
5. It sums up all the ceil values obtained from step 4 to get the total number of fill operations that can be performed.
6. The function returns this total number.

Therefore, the output of `max_fill([[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], 2)` is the sum of ceil values of the divisions, which is `2 + 2 = 4`.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    return sum([math.ceil(sum(arr) / capacity) for arr in grid])
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
4
[/OUTPUT]
