The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "yogurt" ).
The condition `len(word) < 3` is false, so we proceed to the loop.
The loop iterates from the second last character to the first character of the word.
Iteration 1:
    -The character 'u' is a vowel, so we check the next and previous characters.
    -The next character is 'r', which is also a vowel.
    -The previous character is 'o', which is also a vowel.
    -Since both next and previous characters are vowels, we return the current character 'u'.
