The function `tri(n)` is called with ( n = 3 ).
The first condition checks if n is 0. Since n is not 0, we proceed to the next step.
We initialize `my_tri` with `[1, 3]`.
The loop iterates from 2 to 3 (since n = 3).
Iteration 2:
   - `i` is 2, which is even.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(2 / 2 + 1)` results in `my_tri = [1, 3, 2]`.
Iteration 3:
   - `i` is 3, which is odd.
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[3 - 1] + my_tri[3 - 2] + (3 + 3) / 2)` results in `my_tri = [1, 3, 2, 4]`.
The loop ends here.
The function returns `my_tri`, which is `[1, 3, 2, 4]`.
