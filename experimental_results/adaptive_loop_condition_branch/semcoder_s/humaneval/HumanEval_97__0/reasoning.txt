The function `multiply` takes two arguments `a` and `b`. It calculates the absolute value of the remainder of `a` divided by 10 (`abs(a % 10)`) and the absolute value of the remainder of `b` divided by 10 (`abs(b % 10)`). It then returns the product of these two values.

To determine the output of executing the function `multiply` on the input `(2020, 1851)`, we need to calculate the product of the last digits of `2020` and `1851`.

- The last digit of `2020` is `0` and the last digit of `1851` is `1`.
- The product of `0` and `1` is `0`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `multiply` on the input `(2020, 1851)` is `0`.
