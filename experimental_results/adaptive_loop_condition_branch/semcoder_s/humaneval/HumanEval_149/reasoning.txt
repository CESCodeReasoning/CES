The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["aa", "a", "aaa"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted to ["a", "aa", "aaa"].
A new empty list `new_lst` is initialized.
Iteration 1:
    -The string 'a' has length 1, which is odd.
Iteration 2:
    -The string 'aa' has length 2, which is even, so it is appended to `new_lst`.
Iteration 3:
    -The string 'aaa' has length 3, which is odd.
After the loop, `new_lst` contains ["aa"].
Finally, the function returns the sorted `new_lst` based on the length of the strings, which is ["aa"].
