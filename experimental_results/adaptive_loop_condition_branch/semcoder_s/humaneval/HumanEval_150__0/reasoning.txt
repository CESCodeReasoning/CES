The function `x_or_y` is called with ( n = 3, x = 33, y = 5212 ).
The condition `n == 1` is false, so we move to the loop.
The loop iterates from 2 to 3 (since n = 3).
   - The condition `n % i == 0` is not satisfied for i = 2.
   - The loop ends without returning `y`.
   - The `else` block is executed, and `x` is returned.
Therefore, the final output of the function `x_or_y(3, 33, 5212)` is 33.
