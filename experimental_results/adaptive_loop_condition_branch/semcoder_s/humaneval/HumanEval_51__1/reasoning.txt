The function `remove_vowels` takes a string `text` as input and returns a new string with all vowels removed.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character `s` in the input text.
It checks if the lowercase version of the character is not in the list of vowels (a, e, i, o, u).
If the character is not a vowel, it is included in the new string.
If the character is a vowel, it is not included in the new string.
The `join` method is used to concatenate all the non-vowel characters into a single string.

For the input 'ybcd', the function will remove the vowels and return 'ybcd', as there are no vowels in the input string.
