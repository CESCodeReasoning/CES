The function `maximum` is called with ( arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3 ).
The condition `k == 0` is false (since k = 3).
The `if` condition is skipped.
The `arr.sort()` method is called, sorting the list `[-3, -4, 5]` to `[-4, -3, 5]`.
The last `k` elements of the sorted list are taken, which are `[5]`.
Therefore, the final output of the function `maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3)` is `[5]`.
