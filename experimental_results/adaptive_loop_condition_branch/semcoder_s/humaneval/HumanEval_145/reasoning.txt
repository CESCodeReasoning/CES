The function `order_by_points` is called with ( nums = [1, 11, -1, -11, -12] ).
The function `digits_sum` is defined within `order_by_points`.
The `sorted` function is used to sort the `nums` list based on the `digits_sum` function.
The `digits_sum` function calculates the sum of the digits of a number.
For each number in `nums`, the `digits_sum` function is applied to calculate the sum of its digits.
The `sorted` function uses this sum to sort the numbers in `nums`.
The sorted list is returned as the output.

Therefore, the final output of the function `order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12])` is the sorted list of the numbers based on the sum of their digits.
