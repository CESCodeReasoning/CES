The function `digits` is called with ( n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1 and `odd_count` to 0.
The loop iterates over the digits of `n` (which is 5).
Iteration 1:
    -The digit '5' is converted to an integer (5).
    -5 is not odd, so no action is taken.
Iteration 2:
    -The loop ends as there are no more digits.
The condition `odd_count == 0` is false (`odd_count` is 0), so the `else` block is executed.
The function returns 0 as `odd_count` is 0.
