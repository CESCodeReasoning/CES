The function `exchange` is called with ( lst1 = [3, 2, 6, 1, 8, 9] , lst2 = [3, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1] ).
Inside the function, two variables `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 3 in lst1 is odd, so odd becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 2 in lst1 is even, so even becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 6 in lst1 is even, so even becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 1 in lst1 is odd, so odd becomes 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 8 in lst1 is even, so even becomes 3.
Iteration 6:
    -The character 9 in lst1 is odd, so odd becomes 3.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 3 in lst2 is odd, so odd becomes 3.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 5 in lst2 is odd, so odd becomes 4.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 5 in lst2 is odd, so odd becomes 5.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 1 in lst2 is odd, so odd becomes 6.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 1 in lst2 is odd, so odd becomes 7.
Iteration 6:
    -The character 1 in lst2 is odd, so odd becomes 8.

The condition `even >= odd` is checked. Since 8 >= 7, the function returns "YES".
