The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
If the current number i is even:
    - Calculate the factorial of i by multiplying all numbers from 1 to i.
    - Append the calculated factorial to the result list ret.
If the current number i is odd:
    - Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to i.
    - Append the calculated sum to the result list ret.
Finally, return the result list ret.
