The function `sum_to_n` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive.
To calculate the sum of all numbers from 0 to 100, we need to sum all numbers from 0 to 100 inclusive.
This can be calculated using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`.
Therefore, the sum of all numbers from 0 to 100 is `100*101/2 = 5050`.
