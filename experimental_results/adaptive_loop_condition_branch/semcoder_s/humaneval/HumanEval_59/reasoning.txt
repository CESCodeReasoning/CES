The function `largest_prime_factor` is called with ( n = 15 ).
Inside the function, a variable `largest` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 2 through 15 (since ( n = 15 )).
Iteration 1 (j = 2)
   - `n` is divisible by 2 and 2 is a prime number (True).
   - Action: `largest` is updated to 2.
Iteration 2 (j = 3)
   - `n` is divisible by 3 and 3 is a prime number (True).
   - Action: `largest` is updated to 3.
Iteration 3 (j = 4)
   - `n` is not divisible by 4.
Iteration 4 (j = 5)
   - `n` is divisible by 5 and 5 is a prime number (True).
   - Action: `largest` is updated to 5.
Iteration 5 (j = 6)
   - `n` is not divisible by 6.
Iteration 6 (j = 7)
   - `n` is divisible by 7 and 7 is a prime number (True).
   - Action: `largest` is updated to 7.
Iteration 7 (j = 8)
   - `n` is not divisible by 8.
Iteration 8 (j = 9)
   - `n` is not divisible by 9.
Iteration 9 (j = 10)
   - `n` is not divisible by 10.
Iteration 10 (j = 11)
   - `n` is divisible by 11 and 11 is a prime number (True).
   - Action: `largest` is updated to 11.
Iteration 11 (j = 12)
   - `n` is not divisible by 12.
Iteration 12 (j = 13)
   - `n` is divisible by 13 and 13 is a prime number (True).
   - Action: `largest` is updated to 13.
Iteration 13 (j = 14)
   - `n` is not divisible by 14.
Iteration 14 (j = 15)
   - `n` is not divisible by 15.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `largest`, which is now 13.

Therefore, the final output of the function `largest_prime_factor(15)` is 13.
