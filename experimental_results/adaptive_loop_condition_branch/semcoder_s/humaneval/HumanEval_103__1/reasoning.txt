The function `rounded_avg` is called with ( n = 350, m = 902 ).
The condition `m < n` is not satisfied ( 902 > 350 ), so the if branch is not taken.
The loop iterates from 350 through 902 (since ( n = 350, m = 902 )).
The summation of the numbers in this range is calculated.
The average is calculated by dividing the summation by the count of numbers in the range ( m - n + 1 = 902 - 350 + 1 = 552 ).
The average is then rounded and converted to binary using the `bin` function.
The binary representation of the rounded average is returned.
