<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def add_elements(arr, k):
    return sum(elem for elem in arr[:k] if len(str(elem)) <= 2)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
add_elements([11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9], 4)
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `add_elements` takes two arguments: a list `arr` of integers and an integer `k`. It calculates the sum of the first `k` elements in the list `arr` that have a length of 1 or 2 digits.

- The first `k=4` elements of `arr` are `[11, 21, 3, 90]`.
- The elements `11` and `21` have 2 digits, so they are included in the sum.
- The element `3` has 1 digit, so it is included in the sum.
- The element `90` has 2 digits, so it is included in the sum.
- The sum of these elements is `11 + 21 + 3 + 90 = 125`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `add_elements([11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9], 4)` is `125`.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def add_elements(arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    return sum(elem for elem in arr[:k] if len(str(elem)) <= 2)
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
125
[/OUTPUT]
