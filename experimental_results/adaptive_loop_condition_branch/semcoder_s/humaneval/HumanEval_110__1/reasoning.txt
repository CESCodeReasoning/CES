The function `exchange` is called with ( lst1 = [100, 200] , lst2 = [200, 200] ).
Inside the function, two variables `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '100' is even, so even becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '200' is even, so even becomes 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '200' is even, so even becomes 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '200' is even, so even becomes 4.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '100' is odd, so odd becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '200' is even, so even becomes 5.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '200' is even, so even becomes 6.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '200' is even, so even becomes 7.

The condition `even >= odd` (7 >= 1) is true, so the function returns "YES".
