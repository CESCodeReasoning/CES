The function `filter_by_substring` takes a list of strings and a substring as input and returns a new list containing only the strings that contain the specified substring.

- The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input list.
- For each string, it checks if the substring is present in the string using the `in` operator.
- If the substring is found in the string, the string is included in the new list.
- Finally, the function returns the new list containing strings that contain the specified substring.

Since the input list is empty, the output list will also be empty.
