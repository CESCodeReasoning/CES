The function `file_name_check` is called with ( file_name = '@this1_is6_valid.exe' ).
The list `suf` contains the valid suffixes: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'].
The file name is split by '.' and stored in `lst`.
First Condition (len(lst) != 2)
   - The length of `lst` is 3, so the condition is False.
Second Condition (not lst[1] in suf)
   - The suffix 'exe' is in `suf`, so the condition is False.
Third Condition (len(lst[0]) == 0)
   - The length of the first part of the split file name is 0, so the condition is False.
Fourth Condition (not lst[0][0].isalpha())
   - The first character of the first part of the split file name is '@', which is not an alphabet, so the condition is False.
Fifth Condition (t > 3)
   - The count of digits in the first part of the split file name is 3, which is not greater than 3, so this condition is not executed.
Since none of the conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `file_name_check('@this1_is6_valid.exe')` is 'Yes'.
