<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return string.swapcase()
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
flip_case('These violent delights have violent ends')
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function flip_case takes a string as input and returns the string with the case of each character flipped.
To determine the output of executing the function flip_case on the input 'These violent delights have violent ends', we need to flip the case of each character in the input string.
The string 'These violent delights have violent ends' becomes 'tHISe VIOLENT dElIGHTS hAvE vIOLENT eNds'.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return string.swapcase()
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
'tHISe VIOLENT dElIGHTS hAvE vIOLENT eNds'
[/OUTPUT]
