<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def unique(l: list):
    return sorted(list(set(l)))
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) 
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function unique takes a list l as input and returns a new list that contains only unique elements from the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input list [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], we need to remove duplicates from the list.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates.
2. Convert the set back to a list to maintain the order of elements.
3. Sort the list to ensure the elements are in ascending order.

Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input list [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123] is [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123].
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
from typing import *
def unique(l: list):
    return sorted(list(set(l)))
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
[/OUTPUT]
