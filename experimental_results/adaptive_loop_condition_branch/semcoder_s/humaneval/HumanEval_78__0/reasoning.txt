The function `hex_key` is called with ( num = "2020" ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the characters in the string "2020".
First Iteration (i = 0):
   - The character '2' is in the `primes` tuple, so `total` is incremented by 1.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
   - The character '0' is not in the `primes` tuple.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
   - The character '2' is in the `primes` tuple, so `total` is incremented by 1.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
   - The character '0' is not in the `primes` tuple.
The loop ends, and the function returns the value of `total`, which is 2.
