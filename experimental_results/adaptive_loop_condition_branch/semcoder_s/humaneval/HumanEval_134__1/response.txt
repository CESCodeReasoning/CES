<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):

    check = txt.split(' ')[-1]
    return True if len(check) == 1 and (
        97 <= ord(check.lower()) <= 122) else False
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("A")
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a string `txt` as input and checks if the last character in the string is a letter.

- The function splits the input string `txt` by space and selects the last element using `split(' ')[-1]`.
- It then checks if the length of the selected element is 1 and if the ASCII value of the lowercase version of the selected element falls within the range of lowercase letters (97 to 122).
- If both conditions are met, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Given the input "A", the function will split the string into ["A"] and check if the length of the last element "A" is 1 and if the ASCII value of the lowercase version of "A" (97) falls within the range of lowercase letters (97 to 122). Since both conditions are met, the function will return `True`.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):

    check = txt.split(' ')[-1]  # ??
    return True if len(check) == 1 and (
        97 <= ord(check.lower()) <= 122) else False  # ??
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
True
[/OUTPUT]
