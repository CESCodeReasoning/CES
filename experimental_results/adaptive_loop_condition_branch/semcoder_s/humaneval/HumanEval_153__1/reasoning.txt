The function `Strongest_Extension` is called with ( class_name = 'finNNalLLly', extensions = ['Die', 'NowW', 'Wow', 'WoW'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `strong` is initialized to the first element of the `extensions` list, which is 'Die'.
A variable `my_val` is calculated by counting the number of uppercase letters minus the number of lowercase letters in the first extension 'Die'.

Iteration 1:
    -The extension 'Die' has 0 uppercase letters and 3 lowercase letters, so `val = 0 - 3 = -3`.
Iteration 2:
    -The extension 'NowW' has 2 uppercase letters and 2 lowercase letters, so `val = 2 - 2 = 0`.
Iteration 3:
    -The extension 'Wow' has 1 uppercase letter and 2 lowercase letters, so `val = 1 - 2 = -1`.
Iteration 4:
    -The extension 'WoW' has 1 uppercase letter and 2 lowercase letters, so `val = 1 - 2 = -1`.

Since 'Die' has the most uppercase letters, it is selected as the strongest extension.

The final output is 'finNNalLLly.Die'.
