The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'xywzx' ).
The loop iterates over the indices of the characters in the string.
First Iteration (i = 0):
   - The characters at indices 0 and (len(text) - 1 - 0) = 5 - 1 - 0 = 4 are 'x' and 'x'.
   - They are equal, so the condition is False.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
   - The characters at indices 1 and (len(text) - 1 - 1) = 5 - 1 - 1 = 3 are 'y' and 'z'.
   - They are not equal, so the condition is True, and the function returns False.
