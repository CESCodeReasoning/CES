The function `bf` is called with ( planet1 = "Earth", planet2 = "Earth" ).
The `if` condition checks if either `planet1` or `planet2` is not in `planet_names` or if they are the same.
Since both `planet1` and `planet2` are "Earth", the condition is False, and the function proceeds.
`planet1_index` is assigned the index of "Earth" in `planet_names`, which is 2.
`planet2_index` is assigned the index of "Earth" in `planet_names`, which is 2.
Since `planet1_index` is equal to `planet2_index`, the `else` block is executed.
The function returns an empty tuple `()`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `bf("Earth", "Earth")` is an empty tuple `()`.
