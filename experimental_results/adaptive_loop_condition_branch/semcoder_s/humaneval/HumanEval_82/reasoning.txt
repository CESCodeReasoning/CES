The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Hello' ).
The length of the string 'Hello' is 5.
The function checks if the length is 0 or 1, which is not the case here.
The function then iterates from 2 to 5 (length of the string).
   - For i = 2, 3, and 4, it checks if 5 is divisible by i (2, 3, and 4).
   - Since 5 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 4, the function returns True.
Therefore, the function `prime_length('Hello')` returns True.
