The function `solution` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of elements at even indices that are odd numbers in the list.

- The list `[30, 13, 23, 32]` is given as input.
- The function iterates over the elements of the list along with their indices using `enumerate`.
- For the given list, the elements at even indices are at 0, 2 indices. The elements are 30, 23.
- 30 is an odd number, so it is included in the sum.
- 23 is an odd number, so it is included in the sum.
- The sum of the odd numbers at even indices is 30 + 23 = 53.
