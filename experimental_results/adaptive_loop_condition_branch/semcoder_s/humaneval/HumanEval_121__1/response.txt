<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def solution(lst):
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx % 2 == 0 and x % 2 == 1])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
solution([30, 13, 23, 32])
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `solution` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of elements at even indices that are odd numbers in the list.

- The list `[30, 13, 23, 32]` is given as input.
- The function iterates over the elements of the list along with their indices using `enumerate`.
- For the given list, the elements at even indices are at 0, 2 indices. The elements are 30, 23.
- 30 is an odd number, so it is included in the sum.
- 23 is an odd number, so it is included in the sum.
- The sum of the odd numbers at even indices is 30 + 23 = 53.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def solution(lst):
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx % 2 == 0 and x % 2 == 1])
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
53
[/OUTPUT]
