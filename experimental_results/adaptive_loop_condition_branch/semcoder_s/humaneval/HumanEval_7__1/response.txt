<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if substring in x]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
filter_by_substring(['xxx', 'asd', 'aaaxxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xx')
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `filter_by_substring` takes a list of strings and a substring as input and returns a new list containing only the strings that contain the specified substring.

- The list comprehension `[x for x in strings if substring in x]` iterates over each string in the input list and includes it in the output list only if the substring is found in that string.
- For the input `filter_by_substring(['xxx', 'asd', 'aaaxxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xx')`, the strings 'xxx', 'xxxAAA', and 'xxx' contain the substring 'xx', so they will be included in the output list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `filter_by_substring(['xxx', 'asd', 'aaaxxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xx')` will be `['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']`.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if substring in x]
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']
[/OUTPUT]
