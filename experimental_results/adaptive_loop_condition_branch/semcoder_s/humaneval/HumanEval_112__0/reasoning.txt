The function `reverse_delete` takes two arguments `s` and `c`. It first removes all occurrences of characters in `c` from `s`. Then, it checks if the resulting string `s` is the same when reversed as it is forward.

For the input `reverse_delete("abcdedcba","v")`:
- The string `s` after removing characters in `c` is `"abcdedcba"`.
- The reversed string `s[::-1]` is also `"abcdedcba"`.
- Therefore, the second element of the tuple returned by the function is `True`.

So, the output of the function `reverse_delete("abcdedcba","v")` is `("abcdedcba", True)`.
