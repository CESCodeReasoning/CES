The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "<<><>>" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '<' is encountered, so depth is incremented to 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '<' is encountered, so depth is incremented to 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '>' is encountered, so depth is decremented to 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '>' is encountered, so depth is decremented to 0.

After the loop, the function checks if `depth` is 0. Since it is, the function returns True.
