The function select_words(s, n) takes a string `s` and an integer `n` as its parameters.
The function splits the string `s` into words and iterates through each word.
For each word, it counts the number of consonants.
If the number of consonants in a word is equal to `n`, the word is appended to the result list.
Finally, the function returns the list of words that have `n` consonants.
