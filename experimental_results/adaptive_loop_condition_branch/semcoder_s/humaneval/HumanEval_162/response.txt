<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def string_to_md5(text):
    import hashlib
    return hashlib.md5(text.encode('ascii')).hexdigest() if text else None
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
string_to_md5('Hello world') 
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `string_to_md5` takes a string as input and returns the MD5 hash of the input string.
To calculate the MD5 hash of 'Hello world', we need to:
1. Import the `hashlib` module.
2. Encode the input string 'Hello world' to bytes using ASCII encoding.
3. Calculate the MD5 hash of the encoded bytes.
4. Return the hexadecimal representation of the MD5 hash.

Therefore, the MD5 hash of 'Hello world' is '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text):
    return hashlib.md5(text.encode('ascii')).hexdigest() if text else None
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
'3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'
[/OUTPUT]
