The function `is_happy` is called with ( s = "aabb" ).
The length of the string "aabb" is 4, which is not less than 3, so the first condition is not met.
The loop iterates over the indices of the string from 0 to 2.
Iteration 1 (i = 0):
   - The characters at indices 0, 1, and 2 are 'a', 'a', and 'b'.
   - The condition `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]` is true for the first pair 'a' and 'a'.
   - The function returns False.
