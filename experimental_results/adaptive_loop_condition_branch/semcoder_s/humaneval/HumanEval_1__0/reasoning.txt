The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with ( paren_string = '(()(())((())))' ).
Inside the function, an empty list `result` is initialized to store the separate groups, an empty list `current_string` is initialized to store the characters of the current group, and `current_depth` is initialized to 0 to track the depth of parentheses.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
