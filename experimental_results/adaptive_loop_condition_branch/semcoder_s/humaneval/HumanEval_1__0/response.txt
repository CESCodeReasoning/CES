[INPUT]
sum_of_integer(5)
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function `sum_of_integer` is called with ( N = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `sum_1` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( N = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which satisfies ( 1 <= i < 3 ).
   - The condition `i >= 1 and i < 3` is true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 1` results in `sum_1 = 1`.
Second Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which still satisfies ( 1 <=i < 3 ).
   - The same condition is true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 1` updates `sum_1` to 2 (`1 + 1 = 2`).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which now satisfies ( 3 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `i < 5` is true (while the first condition `i >= 1 and i < 3` is false).
   - Action: `sum_1 += 2` updates `sum_1` to 4 (`2 + 2 = 4`).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, also satisfying ( 3 <= i < 5 ).
   - The condition `i < 5` is still true.
   - Action: `sum_1 += 2` updates `sum_1` to 6 (`4 + 2 = 6`).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
   - `i` is 5, now outside the previous conditions, falling into the `else` block.
   - The `else` block's action: `sum_1 *= 4` updates `sum_1` to 24 (`6 * 4 = 24`).
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `sum_1`, which is now 24.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_of_integer(5)` is 24.

[SCRACHPAD]
[REASONING]
The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with ( paren_string = '(()(())((())))' ).
Inside the function, an empty list `result` is initialized to store the separate groups, an empty list `current_string` is initialized to store the characters of the current group, and `current_depth` is initialized to 0 to track the depth of parentheses.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 2 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 2 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 2 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 8:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` becomes 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 9:
