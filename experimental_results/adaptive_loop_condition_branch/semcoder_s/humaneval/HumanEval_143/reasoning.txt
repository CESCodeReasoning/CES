The function words_in_sentence(sentence) takes a sentence as its parameter.
The for loop iterates through each word in the sentence after splitting it.
For each word, check if its length is 1 or 2. If it is, set the flag `flg` to 1.
If the length of the word is greater than 2, iterate from 2 to the length of the word and check if the length of the word is divisible by the current index. If it is, set the flag `flg` to 1.
If the flag `flg` is still 0 or the length of the word is 2, append the word to the new list `new_lst`.
Finally, join the words in the new list with a space and return the result.
