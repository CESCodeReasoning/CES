The function `all_prefixes` is called with (string = '').
Inside the function, an empty list `result` is initialized.
`len(string)` = 0 since the input string is empty.
The loop iterates from 0 to 0 since `range(len(string))` = [0].

First Iteration(i = 0):
    string[:i + 1] = string[:1] = ''
    result = ['']

The loop ends as there are no more iterations.

The function returns the list `result`, which contains the prefixes of the empty string, which is ['']
