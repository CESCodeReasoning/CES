<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    note_map = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}
    return [note_map[x] for x in music_string.split(' ') if x]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
parse_music('o| .| o| .| o o| o o|')
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `parse_music` takes a string `music_string` as input and returns a list of integers representing the notes in the music string.

- The `note_map` dictionary maps note symbols to their corresponding integer values.
- The `split(' ')` method splits the `music_string` into a list of notes separated by spaces.
- The list comprehension `[note_map[x] for x in music_string.split(' ') if x]` iterates over the list of notes, mapping each note to its corresponding integer value using `note_map` and filters out any empty strings.
- The resulting list of integers is returned as the output of the function.

For the input `'o| .| o| .| o o| o o|'`, the function will return the list `[2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4]`.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    note_map = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}  # Maps note symbols to their corresponding integer values
    return [note_map[x] for x in music_string.split(' ') if x]  # Returns a list of integers representing the notes in the music string
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
[2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4]
[/OUTPUT]
