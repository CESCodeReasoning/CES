The function `eat` is called with ( number = 2, need = 11, remaining = 5 ).
The condition `(need <= remaining)` is evaluated as ( 11 <= 5 ) which is False.
Therefore, the `else` block is executed.
Action: `return [number + remaining, 0]` updates the list to `[2 + 5, 0] = [7, 0]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `eat(2, 11, 5)` is [7, 0].
