The function `decimal_to_binary` takes an integer `decimal` as input and returns the binary representation of the decimal number as a string.

- The function uses the built-in `bin` function to convert the decimal number to binary.
- The binary representation is returned as a string prefixed with "db" and suffixed with "db".

Therefore, the output of executing the function `decimal_to_binary(0)` is "db0db".
