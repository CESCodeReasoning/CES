The function `sort_array` takes an array `arr` as input and returns the array sorted in ascending order. The array is sorted first based on the natural order, and then based on the number of 1's in the binary representation of each element.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the input `[3,6,44,12,32,5]`:
1. The array `[3,6,44,12,32,5]` is passed to the `sorted` function, which sorts the array in ascending order based on the natural order. The sorted array becomes `[3, 5, 6, 12, 32, 44]`.
2. The sorted array `[3, 5, 6, 12, 32, 44]` is passed again to the `sorted` function, but this time we use a custom key function that counts the number of 1's in the binary representation of each element. The binary representation of each element is obtained by converting the decimal number to binary using the `bin` function. The count of 1's in the binary representation is used as the key for sorting.
3. The sorted array based on the count of 1's in the binary representation is `[3, 5, 6, 12, 32, 44]`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `sort_array` on the input `[3,6,44,12,32,5]` is `[3, 5, 6, 12, 32, 44]`.
