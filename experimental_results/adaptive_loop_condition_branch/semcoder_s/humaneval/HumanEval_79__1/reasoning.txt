The function `decimal_to_binary` takes an integer `decimal` as input and returns the binary representation of the decimal number as a string.
To determine the binary representation of the decimal number 103, we need to convert 103 from decimal to binary.
103 in binary is 1100111, so the output of executing the function `decimal_to_binary(103)` is "db1100111db".
