The function `strange_sort_list` is called with ( lst = [111111]).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized as an empty list and `switch` is initialized as True.
First Iteration:
    - lst = [111111], min(lst) = 111111.
    -`res.append(min(lst) if switch else max(lst))` appends 111111 to `res`.
    - lst.remove(res[-1]) removes 111111 from lst.
    - switch is toggled to False.
The while loop terminates as lst is empty. The function returns the value of `res`, which is now [111111].
