The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "abcCd" ).
The condition `s == ""` is false (since s is not an empty string).
The function proceeds to calculate the sum of ASCII values of uppercase characters in the string "abcCd".
The ASCII values of uppercase characters in "abcCd" are 97 (for 'a'), 98 (for 'b'), 99 (for 'c'), 67 (for 'C'), and 100 (for 'd').
The sum of these ASCII values is 97 + 98 + 99 + 67 + 100 = 459.
Therefore, the final output of the function `digitSum("abcCd")` is 459.
