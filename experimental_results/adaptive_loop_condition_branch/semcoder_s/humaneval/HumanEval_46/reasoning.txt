The function `fib4` is called with ( n = 5 ).
The `results` list is initialized with [0, 0, 2, 0].
The condition ( n < 4 ) is not satisfied, so we proceed to the loop.
The loop iterates from 4 to 5 (since ( n = 5 )).
First Iteration (_ = 4):
    results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates results to [0, 2, 0, 2, 2].
    results.pop(0) removes the first element from the list, making it [2, 0, 2, 2].
Second Iteration (_ = 5):
    results.append(results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]) updates results to [2, 0, 2, 2, 4].
    results.pop(0) removes the first element from the list, making it [0, 2, 2, 4].
After the loop completes, the function returns the last element of the results list, which is 4.
