<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    min_number = min(numbers)
    max_number = max(numbers)
    return [(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number) for x in numbers]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
rescale_to_unit([2.0, 49.9]) 
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is rescaled to the range [0, 1] based on the minimum and maximum values in the input list.

1. `min_number = min(numbers)`: Finds the minimum number in the input list.
2. `max_number = max(numbers)`: Finds the maximum number in the input list.
3. `return [(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number) for x in numbers]`: Rescales each number in the input list to the range [0, 1] based on the minimum and maximum values.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `rescale_to_unit([2.0, 49.9])` is `[0.0, 1.0]`.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
from typing import *
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    min_number = min(numbers)  # min_number is 2.0
    max_number = max(numbers)  # max_number is 49.9
    return [(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number) for x in numbers]  # rescaled numbers are [0.0, 1.0]
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
[0.0, 1.0]
[/OUTPUT]
