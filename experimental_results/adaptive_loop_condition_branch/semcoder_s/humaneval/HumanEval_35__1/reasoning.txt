The function `max_element` is called with ( l = [3, 2, -3.5, 0] ).
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list, which is 3.

Iteration 1:
    -The element 3 is not greater than the current maximum (3), so no change.
Iteration 2:
    -The element 2 is not greater than the current maximum (3), so no change.
Iteration 3:
    -The element -3.5 is less than the current maximum (3), so no change.
Iteration 4:
    -The element 0 is less than the current maximum (3), so no change.

Therefore, the final output of the function `max_element([3, 2, -3.5, 0])` is 3.
