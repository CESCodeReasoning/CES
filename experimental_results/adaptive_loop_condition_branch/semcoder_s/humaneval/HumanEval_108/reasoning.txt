The function `count_nums` is called with ( arr = [1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5] ).
The inner function `digits_sum` is defined to calculate the sum of digits of a number.
The outer function iterates over the elements of the input list.
For each element, the `digits_sum` function is applied to get the sum of its digits.
If the sum is greater than 0, it is added to the count.
Finally, the function returns the count of numbers for which the sum of digits is greater than 0.

The `digits_sum` function:
- If the input number is negative, it multiplies the first digit by -1 to keep track of the sign and makes the number positive for processing.
- Converts the number to a list of digits.
- Updates the first digit by multiplying it with the sign.
- Returns the sum of the digits.

Therefore, the final output of the function `count_nums([1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5])` is 5.
