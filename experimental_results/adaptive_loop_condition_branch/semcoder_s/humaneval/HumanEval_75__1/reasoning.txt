The function `is_multiply_prime(a)` is called with ( a = 125 ).
Inside the function, a nested function `is_prime(n)` is defined to check if a number is prime.
The outer loop iterates from 2 to 100 (since the range is 101).
The inner loop iterates from 2 to 100.
The innermost loop iterates from 2 to 100.
