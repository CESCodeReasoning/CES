The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [1,2,3] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `result` is initialized.
The loop iterates over the indices of the input list.
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - The condition `i %3 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` appends the square of the element at index 0 (1**2 = 1) to `result`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - The condition `i %3 == 0` is false.
   - The condition `i % 4 == 0 and i%3 != 0` is false.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i])` appends the element at index 1 (2) to `result`.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - The condition `i %3 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` appends the square of the element at index 2 (3**2 = 9) to `result`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the sum of the elements in `result`, which is 1 + 2 + 9 = 12.
