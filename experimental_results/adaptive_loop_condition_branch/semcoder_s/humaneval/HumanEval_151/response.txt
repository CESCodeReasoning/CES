<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def double_the_difference(lst):
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i%2!=0 and "." not in str(i)])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
double_the_difference([0.2, 3, 5]) 
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `double_the_difference` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of all positive odd integers in the list that do not contain a decimal point.

- For the input list `[0.2, 3, 5]`:
  - The number `0.2` is not a positive odd integer or contains a decimal point, so it is skipped.
  - The number `3` is a positive odd integer and does not contain a decimal point, so it is included in the sum of squares.
  - The number `5` is a positive odd integer and does not contain a decimal point, so it is included in the sum of squares.
- The sum of squares of `3` and `5` is `3^2 + 5^2 = 9 + 25 = 34`.
- Therefore, the function returns `34`.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def double_the_difference(lst):
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i%2!=0 and "." not in str(i)])
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
double_the_difference([0.2, 3, 5]) 
34
[/OUTPUT]
