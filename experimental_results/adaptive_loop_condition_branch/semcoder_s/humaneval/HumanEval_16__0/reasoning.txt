The function `count_distinct_characters` takes a string as input and returns the count of distinct characters in the string.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The input string 'abcde' is converted to lowercase, resulting in 'abcde'.
2. The set function is used to get the unique characters from the string, resulting in {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}.
3. The length of the set is calculated, resulting in 5.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `count_distinct_characters('abcde')` is 5.
