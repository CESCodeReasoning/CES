The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = 'aaaaa' ).
The loop iterates over the indices of the characters in the string 'aaaaa'.
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - The characters at indices 0 and (len(text) - 1 - 0) = 4 are 'a' and 'a'.
   - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - The characters at indices 1 and (len(text) - 1 - 1) = 3 are 'a' and 'a'.
   - The condition is false.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - The characters at indices 2 and (len(text) - 1 - 2) = 2 are 'a' and 'a'.
   - The condition is false.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - The characters at indices 3 and (len(text) - 1 - 3) = 1 are 'a' and 'a'.
   - The condition is false.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4)
   - The characters at indices 4 and (len(text) - 1 - 4) = 0 are 'a' and 'a'.
   - The condition is false.
The loop completes without returning False, so the function returns True.
