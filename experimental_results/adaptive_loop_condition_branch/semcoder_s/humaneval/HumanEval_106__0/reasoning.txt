The function f(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
If the current number is even, calculate the factorial of the number and append it to the list ret.
If the current number is odd, calculate the sum of all numbers up to the current number and append it to the list ret.
First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, the condition `i % 2 == 0` is False, so the else branch is taken.
    - `x` is initialized to 0, then for j in the range from 1 to 2 (inclusive), x is incremented by j, so x = 0 + 1 = 1.
    - The list ret is appended with [1].
Second Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, the condition `i % 2 == 0` is True, so the if branch is taken.
    - `x` is initialized to 1, then for j in the range from 1 to 3 (inclusive), x is multiplied by j, so x = 1 * 2 = 2.
    - The list ret is appended with [2].
Third Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, the condition `i % 2 == 0` is False, so the else branch is taken.
    - `x` is initialized to 0, then for j in the range from 1 to 4 (inclusive), x is incremented by j, so x = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
    - The list ret is appended with [6].
