The function `strange_sort_list` is called with ( lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized as an empty list and `switch` is initialized as True.
First Iteration:
    - lst = [1, 2, 3, 4], min(lst) = 1.
    -`res.append(min(lst) if switch else max(lst))` appends 1 to `res`.
    - lst.remove(1) removes 1 from lst.
    - switch is now False.
Second Iteration:
    - lst = [2, 3, 4], max(lst) = 4.
    -`res.append(min(lst) if switch else max(lst))` appends 4 to `res`.
    - lst.remove(4) removes 4 from lst.
    - switch is now True.
Third Iteration:
    - lst = [2, 3], min(lst) = 2.
    -`res.append(min(lst) if switch else max(lst))` appends 2 to `res`.
    - lst.remove(2) removes 2 from lst.
    - switch is now False.
Fourth Iteration:
    - lst = [3], max(lst) = 3.
    -`res.append(min(lst) if switch else max(lst))` appends 3 to `res`.
    - lst.remove(3) removes 3 from lst.
    - switch is now True.
lst is empty, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `res`, which is now [1, 4, 2, 3].
