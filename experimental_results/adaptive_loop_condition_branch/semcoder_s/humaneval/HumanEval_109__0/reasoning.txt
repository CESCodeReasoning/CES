The function `move_one_ball` is called with ( arr = [4, 3, 1, 2] ).

Initial Conditions:
- The initial array `arr` is [4, 3, 1, 2].
- The sorted array `sorted_array` is [1, 2, 3, 4].
- The minimum value in `arr` is 1, and its index is 2.
- The new array `my_arr` is created by moving the elements from index 2 to the end and then the elements from the beginning to index 2. So, `my_arr` becomes [1, 2, 4, 3].

Iteration 1:
    - The elements at index 1 in `my_arr` and `sorted_array` are 2 and 2 respectively, so they are equal.
Iteration 2:
    - The elements at index 2 in `my_arr` and `sorted_array` are 4 and 3 respectively, so they are not equal.
    - The function returns False.
