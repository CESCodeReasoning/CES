The function `iscube(a)` checks if a number is a cube of another number.

- The function takes an input `a`.
- The absolute value of `a` is taken and stored back in `a`.
- The cube root of `a` is calculated and rounded to the nearest integer.
- The result is cubed and compared with the original number `a`.
- If the result is equal to `a`, then `a` is a cube number, otherwise it is not.

Therefore, the function `iscube(a)` returns `True` if `a` is a cube number and `False` otherwise.
