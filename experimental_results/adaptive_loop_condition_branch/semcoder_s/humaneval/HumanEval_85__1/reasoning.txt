The function add takes a list lst as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list at odd indices.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 4, 6, 8], we need to sum all even numbers at odd indices.
The even numbers at odd indices in the list [4, 4, 6, 8] are 4 and 6.
Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 4, 6, 8] is 10.
