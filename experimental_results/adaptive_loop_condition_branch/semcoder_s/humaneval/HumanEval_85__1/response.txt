<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def add(lst):
    return sum([lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
add([4, 4, 6, 8])
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function add takes a list lst as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list at odd indices.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 4, 6, 8], we need to sum all even numbers at odd indices.
The even numbers at odd indices in the list [4, 4, 6, 8] are 4 and 6.
Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 4, 6, 8] is 10.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def add(lst):
    return sum([lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0])
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
10
[/OUTPUT]
