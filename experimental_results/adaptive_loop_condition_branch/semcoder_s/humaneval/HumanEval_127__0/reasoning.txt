The function `intersection` is called with ( interval1 = [-2, -2], interval2 = [-3, -2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is assigned the maximum value between the start points of the two intervals, and `r` is assigned the minimum value between the end points of the two intervals.
The length of the intersection is calculated as `r - l`, which is `-2 - (-3) = 1`.
The function `is_prime` is called with ( num = 1 ).
Since 1 is neither 0 nor 1, the function checks if it is divisible by any number from 2 to 1 (exclusive), which is not the case.
Therefore, `is_prime(1)` returns `False`.
The condition `length > 0 and is_prime(length)` is `False` since `length` is 1 and `is_prime(1)` is `False`.
Therefore, the function returns "NO".
