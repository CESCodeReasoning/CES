The function `sort_numbers` takes a string of space-separated numbers in words as input and returns a string of the same numbers in words sorted based on their numerical value.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. A dictionary `value_map` is created to map the word numbers to their corresponding numerical values.
2. The input string is split by space and each word is converted to its corresponding numerical value using the `value_map`.
3. The list of numerical values is sorted in ascending order.
4. The sorted list of numerical values is joined back into a string with words separated by spaces.

For the input 'five zero four seven nine eight', the numerical values are [5, 0, 4, 7, 9, 8]. After sorting, the list becomes [0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]. The corresponding words are ['zero', 'four', 'five', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine'].

Therefore, the output of executing the function `sort_numbers` on the input 'five zero four seven nine eight' is 'zero four five seven eight nine'.
