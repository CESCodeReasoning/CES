<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    import collections
    c = collections.Counter(numbers)
    return [n for n in numbers if c[n] <= 1]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) 
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `remove_duplicates` takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers where all duplicates have been removed.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. Import the `collections` module to use the `Counter` class to count the occurrences of each number in the input list.
2. Create a Counter object `c` that counts the occurrences of each number in the input list `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]`.
3. Use a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and only keep the numbers that have a count of 1 or less.
4. The function returns a list of numbers that have a count of 1 or less, which removes all duplicates from the input list.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
from typing import *
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    import collections
    c = collections.Counter(numbers)  # Count the occurrences of each number in the input list
    return [n for n in numbers if c[n] <= 1]  # Return a list of numbers with duplicates removed
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5])  # Input list
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Output list after removing duplicates
[/OUTPUT]
