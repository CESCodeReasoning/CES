The function `encode` takes a message as input and performs the following operations:
1. It creates a dictionary `vowels_replace` that maps each vowel to its ASCII character after adding 2.
2. It swaps the case of all characters in the message.
3. It iterates over each character in the message and replaces it with its encoded value from the dictionary if it is a vowel, otherwise it keeps the character as it is.
4. Finally, it joins all the encoded characters together to form the encoded message and returns it.

For the input 'YES':
- The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and their encoded values are 'c', 'g', 'k', 'q', 'u'.
- The message 'YES' becomes 'yes' after swapping the case.
- The encoded message is obtained by replacing 'y' with 'c', 'e' with 'g', 's' with 'k'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `encode` on the input 'YES' is 'cgk'.
