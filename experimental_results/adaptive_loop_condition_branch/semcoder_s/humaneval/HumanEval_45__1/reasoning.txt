The function `triangle_area` calculates the area of a triangle given its base `a` and height `h`. The formula for the area of a triangle is `1/2 * base * height`.
To calculate the area of a triangle with base 2 and height 2, we need to substitute these values into the formula and evaluate it.
Therefore, the area of the triangle is `1/2 * 2 * 2 = 2.0`.
