<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def sort_array(arr):
    return sorted(sorted(arr), key=lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1'))
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sort_array([1,5,2,3,4]) 
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `sort_array` takes an array `arr` as input and returns the array sorted in ascending order. The sorting is done in two steps:
1. Sort the array based on the binary representation of each element.
2. Sort the array based on the count of '1's in the binary representation.

To determine the output of executing the function `sort_array` on the input `[1,5,2,3,4]`, we need to follow these steps:
1. Convert each element of the array to its binary representation.
2. Sort the array based on the count of '1's in the binary representation.
3. Return the sorted array.

The binary representation of 1 is '1', the binary representation of 5 is '101', the binary representation of 2 is '10', the binary representation of 3 is '11', and the binary representation of 4 is '100'.
After sorting based on the count of '1's in the binary representation, the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

Therefore, the output of executing the function `sort_array` on the input `[1,5,2,3,4]` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def sort_array(arr):
    return sorted(sorted(arr), key=lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1'))
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[/OUTPUT]
