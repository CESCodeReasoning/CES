The function `sort_array` takes an array `arr` as input and returns the array sorted in ascending order. The sorting is done in two steps:
1. Sort the array based on the binary representation of each element.
2. Sort the array based on the count of '1's in the binary representation.

To determine the output of executing the function `sort_array` on the input `[1,5,2,3,4]`, we need to follow these steps:
1. Convert each element of the array to its binary representation.
2. Sort the array based on the count of '1's in the binary representation.
3. Return the sorted array.

The binary representation of 1 is '1', the binary representation of 5 is '101', the binary representation of 2 is '10', the binary representation of 3 is '11', and the binary representation of 4 is '100'.
After sorting based on the count of '1's in the binary representation, the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

Therefore, the output of executing the function `sort_array` on the input `[1,5,2,3,4]` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
