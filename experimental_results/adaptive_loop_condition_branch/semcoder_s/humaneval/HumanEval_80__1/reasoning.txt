The function `is_happy` is called with ( s = "xyy" ).
The length of the string "xyy" is 3, which is not less than 3, so the first condition is not met.
The loop iterates over the indices of the string "xyy" (0, 1, 2).
Iteration 1 (i = 0):
   - The characters at indices 0, 1, and 2 are 'x', 'y', and 'y' respectively.
   - The condition `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]` is not met.
Iteration 2 (i = 1):
   - The characters at indices 1, 2, and 3 are 'y', 'y', and 'y' respectively.
   - The condition `s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2] or s[i] == s[i + 2]` is met, so the function returns False.

Therefore, the final output of the function `is_happy("xyy")` is False.
