The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
It initializes a list A with the values of the expression i^2 - i + 1 for i in the range from 1 to n.
Then it initializes an empty list ans to store the triples that satisfy the condition.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list A to consider it as the first element of the triple.
The middle loop iterates through each element that comes after the first element to consider it as the second element of the triple.
The inner loop iterates through each element that comes after the second element to consider it as the third element of the triple.
For each triple (A[i], A[j], A[k]), it checks if the sum of the elements is divisible by 3.
If the sum is divisible by 3, it appends the triple to the list ans.
Finally, it returns the length of the list ans, which represents the number of triples that satisfy the condition.
