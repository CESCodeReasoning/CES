The function `numerical_letter_grade` is called with ( grades = [4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `letter_grade` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The grade 4.0 is equal to 4.0, so it appends "A+" to `letter_grade`.
Iteration 2:
    -The grade 3 is not equal to 4.0, so it checks the next condition.
    -The grade 3 is greater than 3.7, so it appends "A" to `letter_grade`.
Iteration 3:
    -The grade 1.7 is not greater than 3.7, so it checks the next condition.
    -The grade 1.7 is greater than 3.3, so it appends "A-" to `letter_grade`.
Iteration 4:
    -The grade 2 is not greater than 3.3, so it checks the next condition.
    -The grade 2 is greater than 3.0, so it appends "B+" to `letter_grade`.
Iteration 5:
    -The grade 3.5 is not greater than 3.0, so it checks the next condition.
    -The grade 3.5 is greater than 2.7, so it appends "B" to `letter_grade`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5])` is ['A+', 'A', 'A-', 'B+', 'B'].
