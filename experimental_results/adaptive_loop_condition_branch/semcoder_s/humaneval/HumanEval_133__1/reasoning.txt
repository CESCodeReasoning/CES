The function `sum_squares` is called with (lst = [-2.4, 1, 1]).
Inside the function, a variable `squared` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over each element in the list.
First Iteration (i = -2.4):
    math.ceil(-2.4) = -2
    -2**2 = 4
    squared = 0 + 4 = 4
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    math.ceil(1) = 1
    1**2 = 1
    squared = 4 + 1 = 5
Third Iteration (i = 1):
    math.ceil(1) = 1
    1**2 = 1
    squared = 5 + 1 = 6
