The function `median` is called with ( l = [8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7] ).
The list `l` is sorted to [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 9].
The length of the list is 7, which is odd.
The median is the middle element of the sorted list, which is 7.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([8, 1, 3, 9, 9, 2, 7])` is 7.
