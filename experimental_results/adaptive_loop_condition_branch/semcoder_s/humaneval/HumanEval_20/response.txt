[INPUT]
find_all_duplicate([3, 5, 4, 3, 7, 4])
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function find_all_duplicate(numbers) takes a list of numbers([3, 5, 4, 3, 7, 4]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterats through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=3: compare with 5, 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 1 (numbers[j]=5), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 3 to duplicates.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken. 
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=5: compare with 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=4: compare with 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 4 to duplicates
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=3, Compare with 7, 4:
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - numbers[i] = 7, compare with 4:
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.

First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).

[REASONING]
The function find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float] takes a list of floating-point numbers as its parameter.
The function iterates through each element in the list to compare it with every other element in the list.
For each pair of elements, calculate the absolute difference and check if it is less than the current minimum distance. If it is, update the closest pair and the distance.
First Iteration (idx=0, elem=1.0):
    - Compare with all other elements: (1.0, 2.0), (1.0, 3.9), (1.0, 4.0), (1.0, 5.0), (1.0, 2.2)
        - When idx2 = 1 (elem2=2.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 2 (elem2=3.9), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 3 (elem2=4.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 4 (elem2=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 5 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (idx=1, elem=2.0):
    - Compare with all other elements: (2.0, 3.9), (2.0, 4.0), (2.0, 5.0), (2.0, 2.2)
        - When idx2 = 2 (elem2=3.9), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 3 (elem2=4.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 4 (elem2=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 5 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (idx=2, elem=3.9):
    - Compare with all other elements: (3.9, 4.0), (3.9, 5.0), (3.9, 2.2)
        - When idx2 = 3 (elem2=4.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 4 (elem2=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 5 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (idx=3, elem=4.0):
    - Compare with all other elements: (4.0, 5.0), (4.0, 2.2)
        - When idx2 = 4 (elem2=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 5 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (idx=4, elem=5.0):
    - Compare with all other elements: (5.0, 2.2)
        - When idx2 = 5 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth Iteration (idx=5, elem=2.2):
    - Compare with all other elements: (2.2, 2.2)
        - When idx2 = 5 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is False, the if branch is not taken.
