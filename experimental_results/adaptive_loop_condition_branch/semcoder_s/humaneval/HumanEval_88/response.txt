<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def sort_array(array):
    return [] if len(array) == 0 else sorted(array, reverse= (array[0]+array[-1]) % 2 == 0) 
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sort_array([15, 42, 87, 32 ,11, 0]) 
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `sort_array` takes an array as input and returns a new array. If the input array is empty, it returns an empty array. Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, and in descending order if the sum is odd.

For the input `[15, 42, 87, 32 ,11, 0]`, the sum of the first and last elements is `15 + 0 = 15`, which is odd. Therefore, the array will be sorted in descending order.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
from typing import *
def sort_array(array):
    return [] if len(array) == 0 else sorted(array, reverse= (array[0]+array[-1]) % 2 == 0) 
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
sort_array([15, 42, 87, 32 ,11, 0]) 
[/OUTPUT]
