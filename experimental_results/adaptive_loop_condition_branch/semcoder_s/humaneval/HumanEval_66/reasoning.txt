The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "You arE Very Smart" ).
The condition `s == ""` is false, so we move to the return statement.
The expression `sum(ord(char) if char.isupper() else 0 for char in s)` is evaluated.
This expression uses a generator comprehension to iterate over each character in the string "You arE Very Smart".
For each character:
   - If the character is an uppercase letter (`char.isupper()`), its ASCII value (`ord(char)`) is added to the sum.
   - If the character is not an uppercase letter, 0 is added to the sum.
The sum of ASCII values of uppercase letters in the string "You arE Very Smart" is calculated.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digitSum("You arE Very Smart")` is the sum of ASCII values of uppercase letters in the string "You arE Very Smart".
