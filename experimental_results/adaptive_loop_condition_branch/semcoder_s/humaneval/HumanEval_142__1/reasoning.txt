The function `sum_squares` is called with ( lst = [-16, -9, -2, 36, 36, 26, -20, 25, -40, 20, -4, 12, -26, 35, 37] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `result` is initialized.
The loop iterates over the indices of the input list.
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is true.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i]**2)` appends the square of the first element (-16) to `result`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is false.
   - The condition `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` is false.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i])` appends the second element (-9) to `result`.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is false.
   - The condition `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` is false.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i])` appends the third element (-2) to `result`.
... (similar steps for the rest of the elements)
Seventeenth Iteration (i = 14)
   - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is false.
   - The condition `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` is false.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[i])` appends the last element (37) to `result`.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the sum of all elements in `result`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_squares([-16, -9, -2, 36, 36, 26, -20, 25, -40, 20, -4, 12, -26, 35, 37])` is the sum of squares of all elements in the input list.
