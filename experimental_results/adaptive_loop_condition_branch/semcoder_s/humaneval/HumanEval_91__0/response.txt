<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def is_bored(S):
    import re
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)
    return sum(sentence[0:2] == 'I ' for sentence in sentences)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
is_bored("You and I are going for a walk")
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `is_bored` takes a string `S` as input and checks the number of sentences in it that start with "I ".

- The `re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)` method is used to split the string `S` into a list of sentences. The regular expression `[.?!]` matches any of the characters ., ?, or !, and `\s*` matches any number of whitespace characters.
- The list comprehension `sentence[0:2] == 'I ' for sentence in sentences` generates a list of boolean values indicating whether each sentence starts with "I ".
- The `sum` function adds up the boolean values in the list, resulting in the total count of sentences that start with "I ".
- The function returns this count as the output.

For the input "You and I are going for a walk", there is one sentence that starts with "I ", so the output of the function `is_bored("You and I are going for a walk")` is 1.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def is_bored(S):
    import re
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)  # Splits the input string into a list of sentences
    return sum(sentence[0:2] == 'I ' for sentence in sentences)  # Counts the number of sentences that start with 'I '
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
1
[/OUTPUT]
