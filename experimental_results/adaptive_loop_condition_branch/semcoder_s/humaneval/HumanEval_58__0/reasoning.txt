The function common(l1, l2) takes two lists l1 and l2 as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each element in l1 to compare it against the elements in l2.
In the inner loop, for each element e1 in l1, compare it with every element e2 in l2.
First Iteration:
    - `e1` is 4, `e2` in the inner loop is 3, 2, 8.
    - 4 is not equal to 3, 2, 8.
    - `e1` is 3, `e2` in the inner loop is 2, 8.
    - 3 is not equal to 2, 8.
    - `e1` is 2, `e2` in the inner loop is 8.
    - 2 is not equal to 8.
    - `e1` is 8, `e2` in the inner loop is no more elements.
Second Iteration:
    - `e1` is 3, `e2` in the inner loop is 2, 8.
    - 3 is not equal to 2, 8.
    - `e1` is 2, `e2` in the inner loop is 8.
    - 2 is equal to 2, so add 2 to the set ret.
    - `e1` is 8, `e2` in the inner loop is no more elements.
Third Iteration:
    - `e1` is 4, `e2` in the inner loop is 3, 2, 8.
    - 4 is equal to 4, so add 4 to the set ret.
    - `e1` is 3, `e2` in the inner loop is 2, 8.
    - 3 is not equal to 2, 8.
    - `e1` is 2, `e2` in the inner loop is 8.
    - 2 is not equal to 8.
    - `e1` is 8, `e2` in the inner loop is no more elements.
