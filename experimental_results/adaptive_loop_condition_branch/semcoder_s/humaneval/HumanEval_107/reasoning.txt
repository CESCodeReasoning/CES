The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with ( n = 123 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number 1 is odd and a palindrome, so odd_palindrome_count becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The number 2 is even but not a palindrome, so no count changes.
Iteration 3:
    -The number 3 is odd and a palindrome, so odd_palindrome_count becomes 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_palindrome(123)` is (0, 2).
