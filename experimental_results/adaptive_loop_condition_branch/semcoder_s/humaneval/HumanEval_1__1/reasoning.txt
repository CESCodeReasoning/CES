The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with ( paren_string = '()()((((()()((()))))()()()))' ).
Inside the function, an empty list `result` is initialized to store the separate groups, an empty list `current_string` is initialized to store the characters of the current group, and `current_depth` is initialized to 0 to track the depth of parentheses.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` is incremented to 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` is decremented to 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since `current_depth` is now 0, the condition `current_depth == 0` is true.
    -The current group '()' is added to `result` and `current_string` is cleared.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` is incremented to 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` is incremented to 2 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` is incremented to 3 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` is decremented to 2 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` is incremented to 3 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 8:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` is decremented to 2 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 9:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` is decremented to 1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since `current_depth` is now 0, the condition `current_depth == 0` is true.
    -The current group '((((()()((()))))()()()))' is added to `result` and `current_string` is cleared.

Therefore, the final output of the function `separate_paren_groups('()()((((()()((()))))()()()))')` is ['()', '((((()()((()))))()()()))'].
