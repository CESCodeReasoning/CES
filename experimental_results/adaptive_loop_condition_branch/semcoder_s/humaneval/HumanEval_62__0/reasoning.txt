The function `derivative` takes a list of numbers `xs` as input and returns a list of derivatives of the input list.
The derivative of a list of numbers is calculated by multiplying each element by its index and then removing the first element of the resulting list.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the derivative of the list is calculated as follows:
- The derivative of `[1, 2, 3]` is `[1*0, 2*1, 3*2]` which is `[0, 2, 6]`.
- Removing the first element, we get `[2, 6]`.

Therefore, the output of `derivative([1, 2, 3])` is `[2, 6]`.
