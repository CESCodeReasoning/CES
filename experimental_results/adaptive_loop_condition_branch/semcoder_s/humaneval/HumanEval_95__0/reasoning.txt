The function `check_dict_case` is called with ( dict = {"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345" } ).
Inside the function, a variable `state` is initialized to "start".

Iteration 1:
    -The key "STATE" is a string and is in uppercase, so `state` is updated to "upper".
Iteration 2:
    -The key "ZIP" is a string and is not in uppercase, so `state` is updated to "mixed".

The function returns `state == "upper" or state == "lower"`, which is `False` in this case.
