The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = 'Wow' ).
The length of the string 'Wow' is 3.
The function checks if the length is 0 or 1, which it is not.
The function then iterates from 2 to 3 (since the length is 3).
The loop checks if 3 is divisible by 2, which it is not.
The loop ends without returning False.
Therefore, the function returns True.
