The function `fib` is called with ( n = 12 ).
The function checks if `n` is 0, 1, or neither.
Since `n` is 12, it does not satisfy either condition, so the function proceeds to calculate `fib(12)` using the recursive formula `fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)`.

To calculate `fib(12)`, it first calculates `fib(11)` and `fib(10)`.
To calculate `fib(11)`, it first calculates `fib(10)` and `fib(9)`.
To calculate `fib(10)`, it first calculates `fib(9)` and `fib(8)`.
This pattern continues until it reaches the base cases (`n = 0` and `n = 1`).

After calculating all the necessary fibonacci numbers, it sums them up and returns the result.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fib(12)` is the 12th fibonacci number, which is 144.
