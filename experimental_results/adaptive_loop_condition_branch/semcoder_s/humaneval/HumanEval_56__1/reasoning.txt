The function `correct_bracketing` is called with ( brackets = "<<<><>>>>" ).
Inside the function, a variable `depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '<' is encountered, so depth is incremented to 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '<' is encountered, so depth is incremented to 2.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '<' is encountered, so depth is incremented to 3.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '>' is encountered, so depth is decremented to 2.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '<' is encountered, so depth is decremented to 1.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '>' is encountered, so depth is decremented to 0.
Iteration 7:
    -The character '>' is encountered, so depth is decremented to -1.
Iteration 8:
    -The character '>' is encountered, so depth is decremented to -2.
Iteration 9:
    -The character '>' is encountered, so depth is decremented to -3.
Iteration 10:
    -The character '>' is encountered, so depth is decremented to -4.
    -The depth is now less than 0, so the function returns False.
