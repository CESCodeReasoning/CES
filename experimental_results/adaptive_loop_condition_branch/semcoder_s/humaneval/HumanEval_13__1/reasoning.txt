The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with ( a = 144, b = 60 ).
Inside the function, a while loop is used to iterate until b becomes 0.
First Iteration (b = 60):
    - a, b = 60, 144 % 60 = 0.
    - a, b = 0, 60.
Second Iteration (b = 60):
    - a, b = 60, 0 % 60 = 0.
    - a, b = 0, 60.
Third Iteration (b = 0):
    - The loop terminates as b is now 0.
The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 0.
