<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def anti_shuffle(s):
    return ' '.join([''.join(sorted(list(i))) for i in s.split(' ')])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
anti_shuffle('')
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `anti_shuffle` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string where the characters in each word are shuffled in alphabetical order.

To implement this, we can follow these steps:
1. Split the input string `s` into a list of words using the `split(' ')` method.
2. For each word in the list, convert it into a list of characters, sort the list of characters, and then join them back into a string.
3. Join all the sorted words back into a single string with spaces in between.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `anti_shuffle` on the input `''` (an empty string) is an empty string `''`.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def anti_shuffle(s):
    return ' '.join([''.join(sorted(list(i))) for i in s.split(' ')])
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
''
[/OUTPUT]
