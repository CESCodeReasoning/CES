The function has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool takes a list of numbers([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]) and a threshold value (0.3) as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by idx in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (idx=0, elem=1.0):
    - `idx` is 0, `idx2` in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - elem=1.0: compare with 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2:
        - When idx2 = 1 (elem2=2.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance: abs(1.0 - 2.0) = 1.0 < threshold (0.3) is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 2 (elem2=3.9), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance: abs(1.0 - 3.9) = 2.9 < threshold (0.3) is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 3 (elem2=4.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance: abs(1.0 - 4.0) = 3.0 < threshold (0.3) is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 4 (elem2=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance: abs(1.0 - 5.0) = 4.0 < threshold (0.3) is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 5 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance: abs(1.0 - 2.2) = 1.2 < threshold (0.3) is True, the if branch is taken. Return True.
Second Iteration (idx=1, elem=2.0):
    - `idx` is 1, `idx2` in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - elem=2.0: compare with 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2:
        - When idx2 = 2 (elem2=3.9), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance: abs(2.0 - 3.9) = 1.9 < threshold (0.3) is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 3 (elem2=4.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance: abs(2.0 - 4.0) = 2.0 < threshold (0.3) is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 4 (elem2=5.0), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance: abs(2.0 - 5.0) = 3.0 < threshold (0.3) is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When idx2 = 5 (elem2=2.2), the condition `idx != idx2` is True, the if branch is taken.
            - Calculate the distance: abs(2.0 - 2.2) = 0.2 < threshold (0.3) is True, the if branch is taken. Return True.
