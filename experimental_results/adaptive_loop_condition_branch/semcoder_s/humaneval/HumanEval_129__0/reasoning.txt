The function `minPath` takes a grid and a value `k` as input.
The function initializes a variable `val` to `n * n + 1`, where `n` is the length of the grid.
The outer loop iterates over each element in the grid.
For each element, if the element is equal to 1, it checks the elements above, below, to the left, and to the right of it.
If any of these elements are not out of bounds, they are added to a list `temp`.
The minimum value in `temp` is then assigned to `val`.

The inner loop iterates `k` times.
If `i` is even, 1 is appended to the `ans` list.
If `i` is odd, `val` is appended to the `ans` list.

Finally, the function returns the `ans` list.
