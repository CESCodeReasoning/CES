The function `tri(n)` is called with ( n = 8 ).
The first condition checks if `n` is 0. Since `n` is not 0, we proceed to the next step.
A list `my_tri` is initialized with the values [1, 3].
The loop iterates from 2 to 8 (inclusive).
Iteration 2:
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true (since 2 is even).
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` appends `2 / 2 + 1 = 1.5` to `my_tri`.
Iteration 3:
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false (since 3 is odd).
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` appends `my_tri[3 - 1] + my_tri[3 - 2] + (3 + 3) / 2 = 1 + 3 + 3.5 = 7.5` to `my_tri`.
Iteration 4:
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true (since 4 is even).
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` appends `4 / 2 + 1 = 3.5` to `my_tri`.
Iteration 5:
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false (since 5 is odd).
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` appends `my_tri[5 - 1] + my_tri[5 - 2] + (5 + 3) / 2 = 3.5 + 7.5 + 6 = 14` to `my_tri`.
Iteration 6:
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true (since 6 is even).
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` appends `6 / 2 + 1 = 4.5` to `my_tri`.
Iteration 7:
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is false (since 7 is odd).
   - Action: `my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)` appends `my_tri[7 - 1] + my_tri[7 - 2] + (7 + 3) / 2 = 14 + 4.5 + 7 = 25.5` to `my_tri`.
Iteration 8:
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true (since 8 is even).
   - Action: `my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)` appends `8 / 2 + 1 = 5.5` to `my_tri`.
The loop ends and the function returns `my_tri`, which is `[1, 3, 1.5, 7.5, 14, 4.5, 25.5, 5.5]`.
