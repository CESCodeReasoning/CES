The function `sort_third` takes a list `l` as input and sorts every third element in the list.

- The list `l` is copied to a new list to avoid modifying the original list.
- The step `l[::3] = sorted(l[::3])` sorts every third element in the list. The `::3` slice notation means "every third element", and `sorted` sorts the elements in ascending order.
- The sorted list is returned.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `sort_third` on the input `[5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]` is `[5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]`.
