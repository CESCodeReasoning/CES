The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None and an empty list `result` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The current number is 1, so running_max is updated to 1.
    -1 is appended to the result list.
Iteration 2:
    -The current number is 2, so running_max is updated to the maximum of 1 and 2, which is 2.
    -2 is appended to the result list.
Iteration 3:
    -The current number is 3, so running_max is updated to the maximum of 2 and 3, which is 3.
    -3 is appended to the result list.
Iteration 4:
    -The current number is 4, so running_max is updated to the maximum of 3 and 4, which is 4.
    -4 is appended to the result list.

Therefore, the final output of the function `rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 4])` is [1, 2, 3, 4].
