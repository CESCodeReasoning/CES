The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['(()(())', '())())'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `S1` is formed by concatenating the first two characters of the first string in `lst`, and `S2` is formed by concatenating the first two characters of the second string in `lst`.

The `check` function is defined to validate if the parentheses in a string are balanced.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `val` is incremented to 1.
    -The character '(' is encountered again, so `val` is incremented to 2.
    -The character '(' is encountered again, so `val` is incremented to 3.
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `val` is decremented to 2.
    -The character ')' is encountered again, so `val` is decremented to 1.
    -The character ')' is encountered again, so `val` is decremented to 0.
    -The loop ends, and `val` is 0, so the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `match_parens(['(()(())', '())())'])` is 'Yes'.
