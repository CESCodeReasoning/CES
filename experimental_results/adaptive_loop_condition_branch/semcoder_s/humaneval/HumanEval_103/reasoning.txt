The function `rounded_avg` is called with ( n = 1, m = 5 ).
The condition ( m < n ) is not satisfied, so the else branch is taken.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( n = 1, m = 5 )).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    summation += i updates summation to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    summation += i updates summation to 3 ( 1 + 2 = 3 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    summation += i updates summation to 6 ( 3 + 3 = 6 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
    summation += i updates summation to 10 ( 6 + 4 = 10 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
    summation += i updates summation to 15 ( 10 + 5 = 15 ).
After the loop completes, the summation is divided by ( m - n + 1 ) which is ( 5 - 1 + 1 = 5 ), resulting in 3.0.
The `round` function is applied to 3.0, resulting in 3.
The `bin` function is applied to 3, resulting in '0b11'.
The function returns '0b11' as the output.
