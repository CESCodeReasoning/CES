The function `even_odd_count` is called with ( num = -78 ).
Inside the function, a variable `even_count` and `odd_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The absolute value of -78 is 78.
    -The string representation of 78 is '78'.
    -The first character '7' is not even, so odd_count becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '8' is even, so even_count becomes 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_count(-78)` is (1, 1).
