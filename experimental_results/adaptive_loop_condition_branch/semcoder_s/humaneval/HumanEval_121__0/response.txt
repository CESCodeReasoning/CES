<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def solution(lst):
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx % 2 == 0 and x % 2 == 1])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
solution([2, 4, 8])
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function `solution` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of elements at even indices in the list that are odd numbers.

- The list `[2, 4, 8]` is given as input.
- The function iterates over the elements of the list along with their indices.
- For the list `[2, 4, 8]`, the elements and their indices are (2, 0), (4, 1), and (8, 2).
- The function filters out the elements that are at even indices and are odd numbers.
- In this case, the only element that satisfies both conditions is `2` at index `0`.
- Therefore, the sum of the single odd number at an even index is `2`.
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def solution(lst):
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx % 2 == 0 and x % 2 == 1])
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
2
[/OUTPUT]
