The function `solution` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of elements at even indices in the list that are odd numbers.

- The list `[2, 4, 8]` is given as input.
- The function iterates over the elements of the list along with their indices.
- For the list `[2, 4, 8]`, the elements and their indices are (2, 0), (4, 1), and (8, 2).
- The function filters out the elements that are at even indices and are odd numbers.
- In this case, the only element that satisfies both conditions is `2` at index `0`.
- Therefore, the sum of the single odd number at an even index is `2`.
