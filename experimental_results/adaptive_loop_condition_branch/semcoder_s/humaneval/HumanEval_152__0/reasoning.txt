The function compare takes two lists game and guess as input. It returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements of game and guess.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the inputs ([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4]), we need to calculate the absolute differences between the elements of the two lists.

- The absolute differences between the first elements of the two lists are abs(1 - (-1)) = 2.
- The absolute differences between the second elements of the two lists are abs(2 - 2) = 0.
- The absolute differences between the third elements of the two lists are abs(3 - 3) = 0.
- The absolute differences between the fourth elements of the two lists are abs(5 - 4) = 1.

Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the inputs ([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4]) is [2, 0, 0, 1].
