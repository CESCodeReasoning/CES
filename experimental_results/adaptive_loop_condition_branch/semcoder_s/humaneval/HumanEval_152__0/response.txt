<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
2. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
3. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
4. Enclose the annotated code with [ANSWER] AND [/ANSWER]
5. Think step by step and print you reasoning process of the code execution.
6. Print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def compare(game, guess):
    return [abs(x - y) for x, y in zip(game, guess)]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
compare([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4])
[/INPUT]

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[REASONING]
The function compare takes two lists game and guess as input. It returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements of game and guess.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the inputs ([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4]), we need to calculate the absolute differences between the elements of the two lists.

- The absolute differences between the first elements of the two lists are abs(1 - (-1)) = 2.
- The absolute differences between the second elements of the two lists are abs(2 - 2) = 0.
- The absolute differences between the third elements of the two lists are abs(3 - 3) = 0.
- The absolute differences between the fourth elements of the two lists are abs(5 - 4) = 1.

Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the inputs ([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4]) is [2, 0, 0, 1].
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
def compare(game: List[int], guess: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return [abs(x - y) for x, y in zip(game, guess)]
[/PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
[2, 0, 0, 1]
[/OUTPUT]
