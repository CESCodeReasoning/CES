The function `check_dict_case` is called with ( dict = {"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"} ).
Inside the function, the condition `len(dict.keys()) == 0` is checked. Since the dictionary is not empty, the `else` block is executed.

The variable `state` is initialized to "start".

Iteration 1:
    - The key "Name" is a string and is checked for being uppercase. Since "Name" is not uppercase, `state` is set to "lower".
Iteration 2:
    - The key "Age" is a string and is checked for being uppercase. Since "Age" is not uppercase, `state` remains "lower".
Iteration 3:
    - The key "City" is a string and is checked for being uppercase. Since "City" is not uppercase, `state` remains "lower".

The loop ends, and the function returns the result of the condition `state == "upper" or state == "lower"`, which is `False`.
