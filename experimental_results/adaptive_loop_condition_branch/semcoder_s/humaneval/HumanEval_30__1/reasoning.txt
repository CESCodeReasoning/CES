The function get_positive takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the positive integers from the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2], we need to filter out the positive integers from the input list.
Since both -1 and -2 are negative integers, they will be filtered out and the output will be an empty list.
