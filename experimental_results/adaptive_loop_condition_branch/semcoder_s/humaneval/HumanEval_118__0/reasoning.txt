The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "full" ).
The condition `len(word) < 3` is false (as the length of "full" is 4).
The loop iterates from the second last character to the first character of the word.
Iteration 1:
    -The character 'l' is not a vowel.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'u' is a vowel.
    -The condition `(word[i + 1] not in vowels) and (word[i - 1] not in vowels)` is true (as both the characters before and after 'u' are not vowels).
    -Return 'u'.
