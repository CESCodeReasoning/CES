The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [4, 3, 2, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to None and an empty list `result` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The current number is 4. Since `running_max` is None, it is updated to 4. The running maximum is 4, so 4 is appended to the result list.
Iteration 2:
    -The current number is 3. The running maximum is 4, so the maximum of 4 and 3 is taken, which is 4. 4 is appended to the result list.
Iteration 3:
    -The current number is 2. The running maximum is 4, so the maximum of 4 and 2 is taken, which is 4. 4 is appended to the result list.
Iteration 4:
    -The current number is 1. The running maximum is 4, so the maximum of 4 and 1 is taken, which is 4. 4 is appended to the result list.

Therefore, the final output of the function `rolling_max([4, 3, 2, 1])` is [4, 4, 4, 4].
