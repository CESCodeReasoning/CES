The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with ( paren_string = '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())' ).
Inside the function, an empty list `result` is initialized to store the separate groups, an empty list `current_string` is initialized to store the characters of the current group, and `current_depth` is initialized to 0 to track the depth of parentheses.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` is incremented to 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` is incremented to 2 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` is decremented to 1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ' ' is encountered, so no action is taken.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` is incremented to 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` is decremented to 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ' ' is encountered, so no action is taken.
Iteration 8:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` is incremented to 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 9:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` is incremented to 2 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 10:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` is decremented to 1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 11:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` is decremented to 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 12:
    -The character ' ' is encountered, so no action is taken.
Iteration 13:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` is incremented to 1 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 14:
    -The character '(' is encountered, so `current_depth` is incremented to 2 and '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 15:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` is decremented to 1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 16:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` is decremented to 0 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 17:
    -The character ' ' is encountered, so no action is taken.
Iteration 18:
    -The character ')' is encountered, so `current_depth` is decremented to -1 and ')' is appended to `current_string`.

The loop ends, and the function returns the list `result` containing the separate groups: ['()()', '(())', '()', '(())()'].
