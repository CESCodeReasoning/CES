The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [15, 33, 1422, 1] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `odd_digit_elements` is initialized.
The loop iterates over each element in the list `x`.
First Iteration (i = 15)
   - The condition `all (int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))` checks if all digits in `i` are odd.
   - Since 15 contains even digit (5), the condition is false.
Second Iteration (i = 33)
   - The condition is false for 33 as it contains even digit (3).
Third Iteration (i = 1422)
   - The condition is false for 1422 as it contains even digit (4).
Fourth Iteration (i = 1)
   - The condition is true for 1 as it contains only odd digit (1).
   - Action: 1 is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the sorted list `odd_digit_elements`, which is [1].
