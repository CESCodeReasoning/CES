The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
It first calculates a list A of n elements using a list comprehension where each element is calculated as i^2 - i + 1 for i in the range from 1 to n.
Then, it iterates through the list A using three nested loops to find all possible triples (i, j, k) such that i, j, and k are distinct indices in the list A.
For each triple, it checks if the sum of the elements at indices i, j, and k is divisible by 3. If it is, it adds the triple to the list ans.
Finally, it returns the length of the list ans, which represents the number of triples that satisfy the condition.
