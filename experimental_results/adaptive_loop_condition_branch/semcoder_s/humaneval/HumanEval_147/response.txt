    return duplicates
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
find_all_duplicate([3, 5, 4, 3, 7, 4])
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function find_all_duplicate(numbers) takes a list of numbers([3, 5, 4, 3, 7, 4]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterats through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=3: compare with 5, 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 1 (numbers[j]=5), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 3 to duplicates.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken. 
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=5: compare with 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=4: compare with 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 4 to duplicates
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=3, Compare with 7, 4:
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - numbers[i] = 7, compare with 4:
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.

First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]).
Replace all the '??' in comments with proper states/values/symbols.
[/QUESTION]
[SCRACHPAD]
[REASONING]
The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
It first calculates a list A of n elements using a list comprehension where each element is calculated as i^2 - i + 1 for i in the range from 1 to n.
Then, it iterates through the list A using three nested loops to find all possible triples (i, j, k) such that i, j, and k are distinct indices in the list A.
For each triple, it checks if the sum of the elements at indices i, j, and k is divisible by 3. If it is, it adds the triple to the list ans.
Finally, it returns the length of the list ans, which represents the number of triples that satisfy the condition.
