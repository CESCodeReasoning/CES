The function compare takes two lists game and guess as input. It returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements of game and guess.

To determine the output of executing the function compare on the inputs ([0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]), we need to calculate the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists.

- The absolute differences between the first elements of the two lists are 0 (0 - 0)
- The absolute differences between the second elements of the two lists are 0 (0 - 0)
- The absolute differences between the third elements of the two lists are 0 (0 - 0)
- The absolute differences between the fourth elements of the two lists are 0 (0 - 0)
- The absolute differences between the fifth elements of the two lists are 0 (0 - 0)
- The absolute differences between the sixth elements of the two lists are 0 (0 - 0)

Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the inputs ([0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]) is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
