The function `sort_third` takes a list `l` as input and sorts every third element in the list.

- The list `l` is copied to a new list to avoid modifying the original list.
- The step `l[::3] = sorted(l[::3])` sorts every third element in the list. The `::3` slice notation means "every third element", and `sorted` sorts the elements in ascending order.
- The sorted list is returned.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `sort_third([1, 2, 3])` is `[1, 2, 3]`.
