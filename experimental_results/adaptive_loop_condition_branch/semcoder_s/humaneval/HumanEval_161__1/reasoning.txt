The function `solve` is called with ( s = "ab" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` is initialized to 0 and `idx` to 0.
A new list `new_str` is created from the input string `s`.
The first loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
First Iteration (i = 'a'):
   - The character 'a' is an alphabet.
   - Action: `new_str[idx] = i.swapcase()` updates the character to 'A' and `flg` to 1.
Second Iteration (i = 'b'):
   - The character 'b' is an alphabet.
   - Action: `new_str[idx] = i.swapcase()` updates the character to 'B' and `flg` to 1.
The second loop concatenates the characters in `new_str` to form a new string `s`.
Since `flg` is 1, the condition `flg == 0` is false, and the function returns the reversed string `s`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `solve("ab")` is "BA".
