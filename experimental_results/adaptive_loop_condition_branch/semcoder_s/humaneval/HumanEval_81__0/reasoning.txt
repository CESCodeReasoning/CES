The function `numerical_letter_grade` is called with ( grades = [1.2] ).
Inside the function, an empty list `letter_grade` is initialized.

Iteration 1:
    -The grade 1.2 is not equal to 4.0, so it moves to the next condition.
    -The grade is not greater than 3.7, so it moves to the next condition.
    -The grade is not greater than 3.3, so it moves to the next condition.
    -The grade is not greater than 3.0, so it moves to the next condition.
    -The grade is not greater than 2.7, so it moves to the next condition.
    -The grade is not greater than 2.3, so it moves to the next condition.
    -The grade is not greater than 2.0, so it moves to the next condition.
    -The grade is not greater than 1.7, so it moves to the next condition.
    -The grade is not greater than 1.3, so it moves to the next condition.
    -The grade is not greater than 1.0, so it moves to the next condition.
    -The grade is not greater than 0.7, so it moves to the next condition.
    -The grade is greater than 0.0, so it appends "D" to `letter_grade`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `numerical_letter_grade([1.2])` is ["D"].
