The function add takes a list lst as input and returns the sum of all elements at odd indices in the list that are even numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88], we need to sum the even number 4 at the odd index 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88] is 4.
