The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, -1, 2, -2, 5, -5, 4, -4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The operation 1 is added to balance, making it 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The operation -1 is subtracted from balance, making it 0.
Iteration 3:
    -The operation 2 is added to balance, making it 2.
Iteration 4:
    -The operation -2 is subtracted from balance, making it 0.
Iteration 5:
    -The operation 5 is added to balance, making it 5.
Iteration 6:
    -The operation -5 is subtracted from balance, making it 0.
Iteration 7:
    -The operation 4 is added to balance, making it 4.
Iteration 8:
    -The operation -4 is subtracted from balance, making it 0.

Since the balance never goes below zero, the function returns False.
