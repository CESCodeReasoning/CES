The function `bf` is called with ( planet1 = "Mercury", planet2 = "Uranus" ).
The `planet_names` tuple contains the names of the planets in order.
The condition checks if either of the planets is not in the `planet_names` list or if `planet1` is equal to `planet2`.
Since both conditions are false, the if branch is not taken.
`planet1_index` is the index of "Mercury" in `planet_names`, which is 0.
`planet2_index` is the index of "Uranus" in `planet_names`, which is 6.
Since `planet1_index` (0) is less than `planet2_index` (6), the condition `planet1_index < planet2_index` is true.
The function returns a list of planets between "Mercury" and "Uranus", which are ["Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn"].

Therefore, the final output of the function `bf("Mercury", "Uranus")` is ("Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn").
