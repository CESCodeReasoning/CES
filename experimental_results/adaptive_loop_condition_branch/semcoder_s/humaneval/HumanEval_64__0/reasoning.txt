The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "bYe" ).
A string `vowels` is defined as "aeiouAEIOU".
The count of vowels in the string `s` is calculated using a generator expression that checks if each character `c` in `s` is in the string `vowels`.
The last character of the string `s` is checked.
   - The last character is 'e', which does not equal 'y' or 'Y'.
   - The condition `s[-1] == 'y' or s[-1] == 'Y'` is false.
   - The `else` branch is executed, and `n_vowels` remains unchanged.
The function returns the count of vowels, which is 1 (for 'b').
