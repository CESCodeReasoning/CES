The function `find_max` takes a list of words as input and returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters in descending order. In case of a tie, the word with the lexicographically smallest order is returned.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `sorted` function is used to sort the list of words based on two criteria:
   - The first criteria is the length of the set of unique characters in descending order. The `-len(set(x))` is used to sort in descending order.
   - The second criteria is the lexicographical order of the words.
2. The sorted list is then indexed with `[0]` to get the first (and in this case, the only) element, which is the word with the maximum number of unique characters in descending order.

For the input `["name", "enam", "game"]`, the words are sorted based on the two criteria mentioned above. The sorted list is `["name", "enam", "game"]`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `find_max` on the input `["name", "enam", "game"]` is `"name"`.
