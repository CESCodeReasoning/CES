The function `filter_integers` takes a list of values as input and returns a new list containing only the integers from the input list.

- The list comprehension `[x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]` iterates over each value in the input list.
- For each value, it checks if the value is an instance of the `int` class using the `isinstance` function.
- If the value is an integer, it is included in the new list.
- If the value is not an integer, it is skipped.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `filter_integers` on the input list `[4, {}, [], 23.2, 9, 'adasd']` is `[4, 9]`.
