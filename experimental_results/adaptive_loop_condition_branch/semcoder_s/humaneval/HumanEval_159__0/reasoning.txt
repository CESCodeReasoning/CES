The function `eat` is called with ( number = 4, need = 5, remaining = 1 ).
The condition `need <= remaining` is checked. Since ( need = 5 > remaining = 1 ) is False, the `else` block is executed.
Action: `return [number + remaining, 0]` updates the values to `[4 + 1, 0]` which is `[5, 0]`.
Therefore, the final output of the function `eat(4, 5, 1)` is `[5, 0]`.
