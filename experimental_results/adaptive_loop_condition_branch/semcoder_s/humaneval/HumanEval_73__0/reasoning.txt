The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1, 4, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over the first half of the array.
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - The condition `arr[0] != arr[len(arr) - 0 - 1]` is `True` (1 != 2).
   - Action: `ans += 1` updates `ans` to 1.
The loop ends as the array has only 3 elements, so it only iterates once.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is now 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1, 4, 2])` is 1.
