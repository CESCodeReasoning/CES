[REASONING]
The function `encode` takes a string `message` as input. The first step in the function is to define a string `vowels` containing all lowercase and uppercase vowels. Next, a dictionary `vowels_replace` is created where each vowel is mapped to a character that is two positions ahead in the ASCII table. For example, 'a' becomes 'c', 'A' becomes 'C', etc.

The `message` is then converted by swapping its case using the `swapcase()` method. This means all uppercase letters in the original message become lowercase and vice versa.

Finally, the function constructs a new string by iterating over each character in the swapped case message. If the character is a vowel (as per the `vowels_replace` dictionary), it is replaced by its corresponding value in the dictionary. If it is not a vowel, it remains unchanged. The resulting characters are joined together to form the final encoded message.

For the input 'TEST', the steps are as follows:
1. Convert 'TEST' to 'test' using `swapcase()`.
2. 'test' contains no vowels as per the `vowels_replace` dictionary, so no replacements are made.
3. The final encoded message is 'test'.

from typing import *

def encode(message: str) -> str:
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"  # [STATE] vowels = "aeiouAEIOU" [/STATE]
    vowels_replace = dict([(i, chr(ord(i) + 2)) for i in vowels])  # [STATE] vowels_replace = {'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 's', 'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'S'} [/STATE]
    message = message.swapcase()  # [STATE] message = "test" [/STATE]
    return ''.join([vowels_replace[i] if i in vowels else i for i in message])  # [STATE] return value = "test" [/STATE]
[/PYTHON]
