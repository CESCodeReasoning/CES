[REASONING]
The function `prime_length` is called with the input string 'Wow'.
1. The length `l` of the string 'Wow' is calculated to be 3.
2. The function checks if `l` is either 0 or 1. Since `l` is 3, this condition is false.
3. The function then enters a loop that checks if `l` (which is 3) is a prime number. It does this by checking if there are any divisors of `l` from 2 up to `l-1`.
4. The loop iterates with `i` taking values from 2 to 2 (since `range(2, l)` translates to `range(2, 3)` which includes only 2).
5. For `i = 2`, the condition `l % i == 0` is checked. Since 3 % 2 is not 0, the condition is false.
6. Since no divisors are found in the loop, the function concludes that the length 3 is a prime number.
7. The function returns `True` indicating that the length of the string is a prime number.
