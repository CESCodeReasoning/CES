[REASONING]
The function `sum_squares` is called with the list `[1, 3, 5, 7]`.
Inside the function, a variable `squared` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates over each element in the list `[1, 3, 5, 7]`.

First Iteration (i = 1):
    `math.ceil(i)` is 1 (since `i` is already an integer).
    `squared += 1**2` updates `squared` to 1 (0 + 1 = 1).

Second Iteration (i = 3):
    `math.ceil(i)` is 3.
    `squared += 3**2` updates `squared` to 10 (1 + 9 = 10).

Third Iteration (i = 5):
    `math.ceil(i)` is 5.
    `squared += 5**2` updates `squared` to 35 (10 + 25 = 35).

Fourth Iteration (i = 7):
    `math.ceil(i)` is 7.
    `squared += 7**2` updates `squared` to 84 (35 + 49 = 84).

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `squared`, which is now 84.
