The function `max_element` is called with the list `[-5, 2, 48, 9, 4, 0, 6, 7]`.
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list, which is `-5`.

Iteration 1:
    - The element `-5` is compared with `m` (`-5`). Since `-5` is not greater than `-5`, `m` remains `-5`.
Iteration 2:
    - The element `2` is compared with `m` (`-5`). Since `2` is greater than `-5`, `m` is updated to `2`.
Iteration 3:
    - The element `48` is compared with `m` (`2`). Since `48` is greater than `2`, `m` is updated to `48`.
Iteration 4:
    - The element `9` is compared with `m` (`48`). Since `9` is not greater than `48`, `m` remains `48`.
Iteration 5:
    - The element `4` is compared with `m` (`48`). Since `4` is not greater than `48`, `m` remains `48`.
Iteration 6:
    - The element `0` is compared with `m` (`48`). Since `0` is not greater than `48`, `m` remains `48`.
Iteration 7:
    - The element `6` is compared with `m` (`48`). Since `6` is not greater than `48`, `m` remains `48`.
Iteration 8:
    - The element `7` is compared with `m` (`48`). Since `7` is not greater than `48`, `m` remains `48`.

After all iterations, the maximum value found in the list is `48`.
