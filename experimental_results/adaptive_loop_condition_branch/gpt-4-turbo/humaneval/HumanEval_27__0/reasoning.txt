The function `flip_case` takes a string as input and returns a new string where each character's case is flipped (uppercase becomes lowercase and vice versa). The method `swapcase()` is used to perform this operation.
To determine the output of executing the function `flip_case` on the input '', we need to consider the behavior of `swapcase()` when applied to an empty string. Since there are no characters in an empty string, flipping the case will still result in an empty string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `flip_case` on the input '' is ''.
