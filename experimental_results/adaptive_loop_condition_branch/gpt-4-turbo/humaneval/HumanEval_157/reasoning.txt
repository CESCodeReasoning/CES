The function `right_angle_triangle` checks if the given sides (a, b, c) can form a right-angled triangle. According to the Pythagorean theorem, a triangle is right-angled if the square of the length of the longest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The function checks all combinations:
1. If \(a^2\) is equal to \(b^2 + c^2\).
2. If \(b^2\) is equal to \(a^2 + c^2\).
3. If \(c^2\) is equal to \(a^2 + b^2\).

For the input values 3, 4, and 5:
- \(3^2 = 9\)
- \(4^2 = 16\)
- \(5^2 = 25\)

The function checks:
1. \(3^2\) (9) is not equal to \(4^2 + 5^2\) (16 + 25 = 41) [CONDITION: False]
2. \(4^2\) (16) is not equal to \(3^2 + 5^2\) (9 + 25 = 34) [CONDITION: False]
3. \(5^2\) (25) is equal to \(3^2 + 4^2\) (9 + 16 = 25) [CONDITION: True]

Since the third condition is true, the function returns True, indicating that the sides can form a right-angled triangle.
