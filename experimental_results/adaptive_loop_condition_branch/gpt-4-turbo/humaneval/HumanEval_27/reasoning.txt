The function `flip_case` takes a string as input and returns a new string where each uppercase letter in the original string is converted to lowercase, and each lowercase letter is converted to uppercase. This is achieved using the `swapcase()` method of the string class in Python.
To determine the output of executing the function `flip_case` on the input "Hello!", we need to apply the `swapcase()` method:
- 'H' (uppercase) becomes 'h' (lowercase)
- 'e' (lowercase) becomes 'E' (uppercase)
- 'l' (lowercase) becomes 'L' (uppercase)
- 'l' (lowercase) becomes 'L' (uppercase)
- 'o' (lowercase) becomes 'O' (uppercase)
- '!' remains unchanged as it is not a letter.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `flip_case` on the input "Hello!" is "hELLO!".
