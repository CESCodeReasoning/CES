The function `prime_length` is called with the string "Hello".
1. The length of the string "Hello" is calculated to be 5.
2. The function checks if the length `l` is either 0 or 1. Since `l` is 5, this condition is false.
3. The function then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `l-1` (i.e., from 2 to 4 in this case).
   - For `i = 2`, the condition `l % i == 0` checks if 5 is divisible by 2. It is not, so the loop continues.
   - For `i = 3`, the condition `l % i == 0` checks if 5 is divisible by 3. It is not, so the loop continues.
   - For `i = 4`, the condition `l % i == 0` checks if 5 is divisible by 4. It is not, so the loop continues.
4. Since no divisors were found in the loop, the function concludes that the length 5 is a prime number.
5. The function returns `True` indicating that the length of the string is a prime number.
