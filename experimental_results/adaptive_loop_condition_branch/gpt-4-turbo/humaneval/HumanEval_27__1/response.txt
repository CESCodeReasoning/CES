[REASONING]
The function `flip_case` takes a string as input and returns a new string where the case of each character in the input string is flipped. This is achieved using the `swapcase()` method of the string class in Python, which converts all lowercase letters to uppercase and all uppercase letters to lowercase.
To determine the output of executing the function `flip_case` on the input "These violent delights have violent ends", we apply the `swapcase()` method:
- 'T' becomes 't'
- 'h' becomes 'H'
- 'e' becomes 'E'
- 's' becomes 'S'
- 'e' becomes 'E'
- ' ' remains ' '
- 'v' becomes 'V'
- 'i' becomes 'I'
- 'o' becomes 'O'
- 'l' becomes 'L'
- 'e' becomes 'E'
- 'n' becomes 'N'
- 't' becomes 'T'
- ' ' remains ' '
- 'd' becomes 'D'
- 'e' becomes 'E'
- 'l' becomes 'L'
- 'i' becomes 'I'
- 'g' becomes 'G'
- 'h' becomes 'H'
- 't' becomes 'T'
- 's' becomes 'S'
- ' ' remains ' '
- 'h' becomes 'H'
- 'a' becomes 'A'
- 'v' becomes 'V'
- 'e' becomes 'E'
- ' ' remains ' '
- 'v' becomes 'V'
- 'i' becomes 'I'
- 'o' becomes 'O'
- 'l' becomes 'L'
- 'e' becomes 'E'
- 'n' becomes 'N'
- 't' becomes 'T'
- ' ' remains ' '
- 'e' becomes 'E'
- 'n' becomes 'N'
- 'd' becomes 'D'
- 's' becomes 'S'
Thus, the output of executing the function `flip_case` on the input "These violent delights have violent ends" is "tHESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS HAVE VIOLENT ENDS".

from typing import *

def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    # [STATE] string = "These violent delights have violent ends" [/STATE]
    return string.swapcase()  # [STATE] return value = "tHESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS HAVE VIOLENT ENDS" [/STATE]

[OUTPUT]
"tHESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS HAVE VIOLENT ENDS"
