The function `is_palindrome` is called with the string 'x'.
1. The function first checks if the input string is empty. Since the string is 'x', which is not empty, the condition `(not string)` evaluates to `False`. Therefore, the branch is not taken.
2. The variable `beginning_of_suffix` is initialized to 0.
3. The function enters a while loop where it checks if the substring from `beginning_of_suffix` to the end of the string is a palindrome. Since the substring 'x' is a palindrome, the condition `(not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]))` evaluates to `False`, and the loop is not entered.
4. The function returns the original string concatenated with the reverse of the substring from the start of the string up to `beginning_of_suffix`. Since `beginning_of_suffix` is 0, the substring is empty, and the reverse of an empty string is also empty. Thus, the function returns 'x'.
