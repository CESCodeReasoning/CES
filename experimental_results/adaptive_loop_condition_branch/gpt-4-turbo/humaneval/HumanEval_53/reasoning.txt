The function `add` is designed to take two integers, `x` and `y`, as input and return their sum.
To determine the output of executing the function `add` on the inputs `0` and `1`, we simply perform the addition of these two numbers.
Thus, the sum of `0` and `1` is `1`.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `add` on the inputs `0` and `1` is `1`.
