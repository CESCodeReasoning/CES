[REASONING]
The function `sum_to_n` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all integers from 0 to `n` inclusive. This is achieved by using the `range` function which generates a sequence of numbers from 0 up to but not including `n+1`, and the `sum` function which calculates the sum of these numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function `sum_to_n` on the input `1`, we need to calculate the sum of the numbers from 0 to 1. The sequence generated by `range(1 + 1)` is `[0, 1]`. The sum of this sequence is `0 + 1 = 1`.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `sum_to_n` on the input `1` is `1`.

[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def sum_to_n(n: int):
    # [STATE] n = 1 [/STATE]
    return sum(range(n + 1))  # [STATE] n + 1 = 2, range(n + 1) = range(2) = [0, 1], sum(range(2)) = 1 [/STATE]
