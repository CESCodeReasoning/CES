[REASONING]
The function `will_it_fly` is called with the list `q = [3, 2, 3]` and the integer `w = 9`.
1. The function first checks if the sum of the list `q` is greater than `w`. The sum of `q` is `3 + 2 + 3 = 8`, which is not greater than `w = 9`. Therefore, the condition `(sum(q) > w)` is `False` and the first branch is not taken.
2. The function then initializes two pointers, `i` at the start of the list (`i = 0`) and `j` at the end of the list (`j = 2`).
3. The while loop condition `i < j` is `True` since `0 < 2`.
4. Inside the loop, the function checks if the elements at positions `i` and `j` are not equal (`q[i] != q[j]`). For the first iteration, `q[0] = 3` and `q[2] = 3`, which are equal, so the condition `(q[i] != q[j])` is `False` and the branch is not taken.
5. The pointers are then updated: `i` is incremented to `1` and `j` is decremented to `1`.
6. The while loop condition `i < j` is now `False` since `1 < 1` is not true, so the loop exits.
7. Since no `False` was returned during the loop, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list `q` is a palindrome and the sum of its elements is not greater than `w`.
