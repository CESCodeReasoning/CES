[REASONING]
The function `sort_third` takes a list `l` as input. The first step inside the function is to create a copy of the list to avoid modifying the original list directly. This is done by `l = list(l)`. 

Next, the function sorts every third element of the list. This is achieved by slicing the list with `l[::3]`, which selects every third element starting from the first element (index 0). The sorted result of these elements replaces the original positions in the list, which is done by `l[::3] = sorted(l[::3])`.

To understand the sorting:
- The original list is `[5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10]`.
- The elements at indices 0, 3, 6, and 9 are `[5, 4, 3, -10]`.
- Sorting these selected elements results in `[-10, 3, 4, 5]`.
- These sorted elements replace the original positions, so the list becomes `[-10, 8, -12, 3, 23, 2, 4, 11, 12, 5]`.

Finally, the modified list is returned.

[ANSWER]
```python
from typing import *

def sort_third(l: list):
    # [STATE] l is initially [5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10] [/STATE]
    l = list(l)  # Make a copy of the list to avoid modifying the original list
    # [STATE] l is now a copy of the original list [/STATE]
    l[::3] = sorted(l[::3])  # Sort every third element and replace in the original positions
    # [STATE] l[::3] before sorting is [5, 4, 3, -10] [/STATE]
    # [STATE] l[::3] after sorting is [-10, 3, 4, 5] [/STATE]
    # [STATE] l after sorting and replacing is [-10, 8, -12, 3, 23, 2, 4, 11, 12, 5] [/STATE]
    return l  # Return the modified list
