The function `string_xor` is called with two binary strings `a = '0101'` and `b = '0000'`.
The function defines a nested function `xor` which takes two characters `i` and `j` and returns '0' if they are equal, otherwise '1'.
The main function uses a generator expression inside `join` to iterate over pairs of characters from `a` and `b` using `zip`, and applies the `xor` function to each pair.

First Pair (i = '0', j = '0')
   - Both characters are equal.
   - The condition `i == j` is true.
   - Action: `xor` returns '0'.

Second Pair (i = '1', j = '0')
   - Characters are different.
   - The condition `i == j` is false.
   - Action: `xor` returns '1'.

Third Pair (i = '0', j = '0')
   - Both characters are equal again.
   - The condition `i == j` is true.
   - Action: `xor` returns '0'.

Fourth Pair (i = '1', j = '0')
   - Characters are different.
   - The condition `i == j` is false.
   - Action: `xor` returns '1'.

The results of the `xor` function for each pair are concatenated to form the final result '0101'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `string_xor('0101', '0000')` is '0101'.
