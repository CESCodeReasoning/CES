The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with `n = 1`.
Inside the function, two counters `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.

The loop iterates from 1 through 1 (since `n = 1`).
First Iteration (i = 1):
   - `i` is 1, which is an odd number (`i % 2 == 1` evaluates to True).
   - The function `is_palindrome` is called with `i = 1`. Since the string representation of 1 is "1", which is the same forwards and backwards, `is_palindrome(i)` returns True.
   - Both conditions `(i % 2 == 1)` and `is_palindrome(i)` are True, so the combined condition `(i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i))` is True.
   - Action: `odd_palindrome_count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `odd_palindrome_count = 1`.
   - The `elif` branch for even numbers is not executed because `i` is not even.

After the loop completes, the function returns a tuple containing the counts of even and odd palindromes, which are 0 and 1, respectively.

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_palindrome(1)` is (0, 1).
