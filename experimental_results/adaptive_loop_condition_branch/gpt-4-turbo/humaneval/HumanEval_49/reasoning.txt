The function `modp` is called with `n = 3` and `p = 5`.
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 0 to 2 since `range(n)` when `n = 3` is [0, 1, 2].

First Iteration (i = 0):
    `ret = (2 * ret) % p` calculates as `(2 * 1) % 5` which equals 2. So, `ret` is updated to 2.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    `ret = (2 * ret) % p` calculates as `(2 * 2) % 5` which equals 4. So, `ret` is updated to 4.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    `ret = (2 * ret) % p` calculates as `(2 * 4) % 5` which equals 3. So, `ret` is updated to 3.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ret`, which is now 3.
