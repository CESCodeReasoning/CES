[REASONING]
The function `count_distinct_characters` takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in that string, ignoring case differences. 
To determine the output of executing the function on the input 'aaaaAAAAaaaa':
1. The input string 'aaaaAAAAaaaa' is converted to lowercase, resulting in 'aaaaaaaaaaaa'.
2. A set is created from the lowercase string, which removes duplicate characters. The resulting set contains only one character: {'a'}.
3. The length of this set is calculated, which is 1, as there is only one distinct character in the set.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `count_distinct_characters` on the input 'aaaaAAAAaaaa' is 1.

[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    # [STATE] string.lower() is 'aaaaaaaaaaaa' [/STATE]
    # [STATE] set(string.lower()) is {'a'} [/STATE]
    # [STATE] len(set(string.lower())) is 1 [/STATE]
    return len(set(string.lower()))
