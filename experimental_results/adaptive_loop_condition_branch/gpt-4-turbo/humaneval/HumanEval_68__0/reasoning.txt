The function `pluck` is called with an empty list (`arr = []`).
1. The function first checks if the length of the array is zero using the condition `len(arr) == 0`.
   - Since `arr` is indeed empty, `len(arr)` evaluates to 0.
   - The condition `(len(arr) == 0)` is true.
   - Therefore, the if branch is taken and the function returns an empty list `[]`.

Since the input list is empty, the function does not proceed to any further calculations or iterations and directly returns the result as an empty list.

Therefore, the final output of the function `pluck([])` is an empty list `[]`.
