The function `fruit_distribution` is called with the string "5 apples and 6 oranges" and the number 21.
Inside the function:
- The string is split into a list of words: `['5', 'apples', 'and', '6', 'oranges']`.
- An empty list `lis` is initialized to store the numbers found in the string.
- The function iterates over each word in the split list:
  - First Iteration (i = '5'):
    - '5' is a digit, so it is converted to integer and added to `lis` (lis = [5]).
  - Second Iteration (i = 'apples'):
    - 'apples' is not a digit, so it is skipped.
  - Third Iteration (i = 'and'):
    - 'and' is not a digit, so it is skipped.
  - Fourth Iteration (i = '6'):
    - '6' is a digit, so it is converted to integer and added to `lis` (lis = [5, 6]).
  - Fifth Iteration (i = 'oranges'):
    - 'oranges' is not a digit, so it is skipped.
- The sum of the list `lis` (which contains [5, 6]) is 11.
- The function returns `n - sum(lis)`, which is `21 - 11 = 10`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 21)` is 10.
