The function `get_positive` takes a list of integers `l` as input and returns a new list containing only the positive integers from the input list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `e` in the list `l`. For each element, it checks if `e` is greater than 0. If the condition is true, the element `e` is included in the new list. Otherwise, it is excluded.

To determine the output of executing the function `get_positive` on the input `[5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]`, we evaluate each element:
- 5 is positive, included.
- 3 is positive, included.
- -5 is not positive, excluded.
- 2 is positive, included.
- 3 is positive, included.
- 3 is positive, included.
- 9 is positive, included.
- 0 is not positive (not greater than 0), excluded.
- 123 is positive, included.
- 1 is positive, included.
- -10 is not positive, excluded.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `get_positive` on the given input is `[5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1]`.
