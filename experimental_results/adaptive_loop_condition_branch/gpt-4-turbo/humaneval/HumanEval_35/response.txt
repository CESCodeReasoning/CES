[REASONING]
The function `max_element` is called with the list `[1, 2, 3]`.
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list, which is `1`.

Iteration 1:
    - The element `e` is `1`, which is equal to `m`.
    - The condition `e > m` is false.
    - No change in `m`.

Iteration 2:
    - The element `e` is `2`, which is greater than `m` (1).
    - The condition `e > m` is true.
    - `m` is updated to `2`.

Iteration 3:
    - The element `e` is `3`, which is greater than `m` (2).
    - The condition `e > m` is true.
    - `m` is updated to `3`.

After iterating through the list, the maximum value found is `3`, which is returned by the function.
