[REASONING]
The function `longest` is called with an empty list as the argument (`strings = []`).
Inside the function:
1. The first conditional statement checks if the list `strings` is empty using the expression `not strings`.
2. Since `strings` is indeed empty (`[]`), the expression `not strings` evaluates to `True`.
3. As the condition is `True`, the function immediately returns `None` without proceeding to calculate `maxlen` or entering the loop to find the longest string.

Therefore, the output of the function `longest([])` is `None` because the input list is empty and does not contain any strings to evaluate.

[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    if not strings: ## [CONDITION](not strings)=True[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=Y[/BRANCH]
        return None

    maxlen = max(len(x) for x in strings)  # This line is not executed in this case
    for s in strings: ## [STATE]strings=[][/STATE]
        if len(s) == maxlen:  # This line is not executed in this case
            return s
