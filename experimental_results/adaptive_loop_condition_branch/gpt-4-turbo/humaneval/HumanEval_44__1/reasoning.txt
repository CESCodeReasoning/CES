The function `change_base` is called with the arguments (x = 9) and (base = 3).
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to an empty string.
The while loop continues as long as `x` is greater than 0.

First Iteration:
- x = 9, which is greater than 0.
- `x % base` calculates to 9 % 3 = 0, so `ret` becomes "0".
- `x //= base` updates `x` to 9 // 3 = 3.

Second Iteration:
- x = 3, which is still greater than 0.
- `x % base` calculates to 3 % 3 = 0, so `ret` becomes "00".
- `x //= base` updates `x` to 3 // 3 = 1.

Third Iteration:
- x = 1, which is still greater than 0.
- `x % base` calculates to 1 % 3 = 1, so `ret` becomes "100".
- `x //= base` updates `x` to 1 // 3 = 0.

Now, `x` is 0, so the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `ret`, which is now "100".
