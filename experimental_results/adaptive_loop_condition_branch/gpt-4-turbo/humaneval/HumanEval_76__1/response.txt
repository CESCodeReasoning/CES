[REASONING]
The function `is_simple_power` is called with ( x = 128, n = 4 ).
The function first checks if `n` is equal to 1. In this case, `n` is 4, so the condition `(n == 1)` is false, and the branch is not taken.
Next, a variable `power` is initialized to 1.
The loop continues as long as `power` is less than `x` (128 in this case).
First Iteration (power = 1):
    - `power < x` is true when power=1 and x=128
    - `power = power * n` updates `power` to 4 ( 1 * 4 = 4 ).
Second Iteration (power = 4):
    - `power < x` is true when power=4 and x=128
    - `power = power * n` updates `power` to 16 ( 4 * 4 = 16 ).
Third Iteration (power = 16):
    - `power < x` is true when power=16 and x=128
    - `power = power * n` updates `power` to 64 ( 16 * 4 = 64 ).
Fourth Iteration (power = 64):
    - `power < x` is true when power=64 and x=128
    - `power = power * n` updates `power` to 256 ( 64 * 4 = 256 ).
After the fourth iteration, `power` exceeds `x` (256 > 128), so the loop exits.
The final check `(power == x)` is false because 256 is not equal to 128.
Therefore, the function returns `False`.
