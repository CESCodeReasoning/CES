[REASONING]
The function `fizz_buzz` is called with `n = 100000`.
Inside the function:
1. An empty list `ns` is initialized to store numbers that are divisible by either 11 or 13.
2. A loop iterates from 0 to 99999 (since `n = 100000`).
   - For each iteration, it checks if the current number `i` is divisible by 11 or 13.
   - If true, the number is appended to the list `ns`.
3. After the loop, the list `ns` is converted to a string `s` by mapping each integer to a string and then joining them.
4. Another loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - It increments a counter `ans` if the character is '7'.
5. The function returns the count `ans`, which represents the number of times '7' appears in the string representation of numbers divisible by 11 or 13 from 0 to 99999.

The output will be the count of '7's in the string representation of numbers divisible by 11 or 13 up to 99999.

    return ans
[/PYTHON]

[OUTPUT]
The output is the count of '7's in the string representation of numbers divisible by 11 or 13 up to 99999. This requires running the function to get the exact number.
