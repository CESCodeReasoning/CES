[REASONING]
The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with the list `["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"]`.
Inside the function:
1. The list `lst` is sorted alphabetically, resulting in `["AI", "asdf", "b", "school"]`.
2. A new list `new_lst` is initialized to an empty list.
3. The function iterates over each element in the sorted list:
   - First Iteration (i = "AI"):
     - Length of "AI" is 2, which is even.
     - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
     - "AI" is appended to `new_lst`.
   - Second Iteration (i = "asdf"):
     - Length of "asdf" is 4, which is even.
     - The condition is true.
     - "asdf" is appended to `new_lst`.
   - Third Iteration (i = "b"):
     - Length of "b" is 1, which is odd.
     - The condition is false.
     - "b" is not appended.
   - Fourth Iteration (i = "school"):
     - Length of "school" is 6, which is even.
     - The condition is true.
     - "school" is appended to `new_lst`.
4. The `new_lst` now contains `["AI", "asdf", "school"]`.
5. The function returns `new_lst` sorted by the length of the strings, resulting in `["AI", "asdf", "school"]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sorted_list_sum(["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"])` is `["AI", "asdf", "school"]`.
