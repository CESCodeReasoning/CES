The function `sum_squares` is called with the list `[1, 2, 3]`.
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized as an empty list.
The length of the list `lst` is 3, so the loop iterates over the indices 0, 1, and 2.

First Iteration (i = 0):
   - `i` is 0, which satisfies the condition `(i % 3 == 0)`.
   - The condition `(i % 3 == 0)` is true.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[0]**2)` results in `result = [1]` (since `1**2 = 1`).

Second Iteration (i = 1):
   - `i` is 1, which does not satisfy `(i % 3 == 0)` and does not satisfy `(i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0)`.
   - Both conditions are false.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[1])` updates `result` to `[1, 2]` (since `lst[1] = 2`).

Third Iteration (i = 2):
   - `i` is 2, which does not satisfy `(i % 3 == 0)` and does not satisfy `(i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0)`.
   - Both conditions are false.
   - Action: `result.append(lst[2])` updates `result` to `[1, 2, 3]` (since `lst[2] = 3`).

Return Statement:
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the sum of the elements in `result`, which is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sum_squares([1, 2, 3])` is 6.
