[REASONING]
The function `filter_integers` is designed to filter out and return only integer values from a given list. The input list contains various types of elements: integers, a dictionary, a list, a float, and a string. The function uses a list comprehension that iterates over each element `x` in the input list `values`. For each element, it checks whether `x` is an instance of `int` using the `isinstance` function. If `x` is an integer, it is included in the output list; otherwise, it is excluded. The elements that are integers in the provided input are 4 and 9. Therefore, these are the only elements that will be included in the output list.

[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    # [STATE] values = [4, {}, [], 23.2, 9, 'adasd'] [/STATE]
    return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]  # [CONDITION] isinstance(x, int) [/CONDITION]
[/PYTHON]

[OUTPUT]
[4, 9]
