The function `largest_prime_factor` is called with `n = 63`.
Inside the function, a variable `largest` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 2 through 63 (since `n = 63`).

Iteration 1 (j = 2):
   - `j` is 2, `n % j == 0` is False (63 is not divisible by 2).
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is False.
   - No update to `largest`.

Iteration 2 (j = 3):
   - `j` is 3, `n % j == 0` is True (63 is divisible by 3).
   - `is_prime(3)` is True (3 is a prime number).
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is True.
   - `largest` is updated to 3.

Iteration 3 (j = 4):
   - `j` is 4, `n % j == 0` is False (63 is not divisible by 4).
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is False.
   - No update to `largest`.

... (similar checks for j = 5 to j = 62) ...

Iteration 61 (j = 63):
   - `j` is 63, `n % j == 0` is True (63 is divisible by 63).
   - `is_prime(63)` is False (63 is not a prime number).
   - The condition `n % j == 0 and is_prime(j)` is False.
   - No update to `largest`.

The largest prime factor found is 7, which is the highest prime number that divides 63.

Therefore, the final output of the function `largest_prime_factor(63)` is 7.
