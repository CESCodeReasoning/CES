[REASONING]
The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and rescales them to a unit range between 0 and 1. The steps involved in the function are:
1. Determine the minimum value in the list using the `min()` function.
2. Determine the maximum value in the list using the `max()` function.
3. For each number in the list, subtract the minimum value from the number and then divide by the range (max - min) to rescale it.
4. Return the list of rescaled numbers.

For the input `[2.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0]`:
- The minimum value is `1.0`.
- The maximum value is `5.0`.
- The range is `5.0 - 1.0 = 4.0`.
- Each number is rescaled as follows:
  - `(2.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 0.25`
  - `(1.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 0.0`
  - `(5.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 1.0`
  - `(3.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 0.5`
  - `(4.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 0.75`
- The output list of rescaled numbers is `[0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75]`.
