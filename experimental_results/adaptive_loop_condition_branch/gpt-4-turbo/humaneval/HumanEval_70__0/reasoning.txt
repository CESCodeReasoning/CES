The function `strange_sort_list` is called with an empty list (`lst = []`).
Inside the function, two variables are initialized: `res` as an empty list and `switch` as `True`.
The while loop checks if `lst` is not empty. Since `lst` is empty, the loop condition evaluates to `False` and the loop does not execute.
The function returns the value of `res`, which remains an empty list as no operations were performed inside the loop.
