The function `can_arrange` is called with the array `[1, 2, 4, 5]`.
Inside the function, a variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = 3` (since the length of the array is 4).

First Iteration (i = 1):
    - The condition `(i < len(arr))` is true when `i = 1` and `len(arr) = 4`.
    - The condition `(arr[i] < arr[i - 1])` is false because `arr[1] = 2` is not less than `arr[0] = 1`. The branch is not taken.

Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - The condition `(i < len(arr))` is true when `i = 2`.
    - The condition `(arr[i] < arr[i - 1])` is false because `arr[2] = 4` is not less than `arr[1] = 2`. The branch is not taken.

Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - The condition `(i < len(arr))` is true when `i = 3`.
    - The condition `(arr[i] < arr[i - 1])` is false because `arr[3] = 5` is not less than `arr[2] = 4`. The branch is not taken.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which remains -1 as no element was found that was less than its predecessor.
