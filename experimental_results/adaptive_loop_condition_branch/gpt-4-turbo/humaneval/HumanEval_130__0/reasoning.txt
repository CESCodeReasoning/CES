The function `tri` is called with `n = 20`.
- If `n` is 0, the function returns `[1]`. However, since `n` is 20, this branch is not taken.
- The list `my_tri` is initialized with `[1, 3]`.
- A loop iterates from 2 to 20 (inclusive) because `n + 1 = 21`.
- For each iteration:
  - If `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`), the function appends `i / 2 + 1` to `my_tri`.
  - If `i` is odd, the function appends the sum of the last two elements of `my_tri` plus `(i + 3) / 2` to `my_tri`.
- The loop continues until `i` reaches 20, appending values based on the conditions.
- Finally, the function returns the list `my_tri` containing the computed values.

The function builds a sequence where even-indexed elements are calculated directly based on the index, and odd-indexed elements are derived from a combination of previous values and the index.
