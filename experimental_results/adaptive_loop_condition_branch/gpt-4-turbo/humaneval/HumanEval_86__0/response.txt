[REASONING]
The function `anti_shuffle` takes a string `s` as input and returns a string where each word in `s` is sorted alphabetically and then joined back with spaces. The steps for the function execution on the input '' (an empty string) are as follows:

1. The input string `s` is split into words using `s.split(' ')`. Since `s` is an empty string, `s.split(' ')` results in a list containing one empty string: `['']`.

2. A list comprehension is used to process each word in the list. For each word `i` in the list:
   - The word is converted to a list of characters: `list(i)`.
   - The list of characters is sorted alphabetically: `sorted(list(i))`.
   - The sorted list of characters is joined back into a string: `''.join(sorted(list(i)))`.

3. Since the input string is empty, the list of characters for the word is also empty, resulting in an empty string after sorting and joining.

4. The list comprehension returns a list containing one empty string: `['']`.

5. The final result is obtained by joining the elements of the list with spaces: `' '.join([''])`. Since the list contains only an empty string, the join operation results in an empty string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `anti_shuffle` on the input '' is an empty string.
