The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a string `txt` as input. The function first splits the string by spaces using `txt.split(' ')` and then selects the last element of the resulting list with `[-1]`. This element is stored in the variable `check`.

For the input "A", the steps are as follows:
1. The string "A" is split into a list containing one element: ["A"].
2. The last element of this list, which is "A", is assigned to the variable `check`.
3. The function then checks if the length of `check` is 1 and if the ASCII value of the lowercase version of `check` is between 97 and 122 (inclusive). These values correspond to the ASCII values for 'a' to 'z'.
4. Since "A".lower() is "a", and the ASCII value of "a" is 97, which is within the range 97 to 122, the condition is true.
5. Therefore, the function returns `True`.

Thus, the output of executing the function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` on the input "A" is `True`.
