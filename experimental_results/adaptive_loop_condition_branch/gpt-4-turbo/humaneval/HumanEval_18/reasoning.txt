The function `how_many_times` is called with an empty string (`string = ''`) and a substring (`substring = 'x'`).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of times the substring appears in the string.

The loop uses `range(len(string) - len(substring) + 1)` to determine the indices to check for the substring. Since `len(string)` is 0 and `len(substring)` is 1, the expression evaluates to `range(0 - 1 + 1)`, which simplifies to `range(0)`. This means the loop does not execute because there are no indices to iterate over in an empty string.

Since the loop does not execute, the variable `times` remains 0. The function then returns the value of `times`, which is 0, indicating that the substring 'x' does not appear in the empty string.
