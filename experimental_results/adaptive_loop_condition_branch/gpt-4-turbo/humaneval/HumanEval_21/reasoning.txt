The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is rescaled to a unit range between 0 and 1. This is achieved by subtracting the minimum value of the list from each element, and then dividing by the range (maximum value minus minimum value).

For the input `[2.0, 49.9]`:
1. The minimum value (`min_number`) in the list is 2.0.
2. The maximum value (`max_number`) in the list is 49.9.
3. Each element in the list is transformed using the formula `(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number)`.
   - For 2.0: `(2.0 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0) = 0.0 / 47.9 = 0.0`
   - For 49.9: `(49.9 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0) = 47.9 / 47.9 = 1.0`
4. The resulting list after applying the transformation to each element is `[0.0, 1.0]`.

Thus, the output of the function `rescale_to_unit` with the input `[2.0, 49.9]` is `[0.0, 1.0]`.
