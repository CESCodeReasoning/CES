[REASONING]
The function `sort_array` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and returns a sorted version of the list. The sorting is done in two steps:
1. The list is first sorted in ascending order.
2. The list is then sorted based on the count of '1's in the binary representation of each number, using a lambda function as the key for sorting.

Let's break down the sorting process for the input `[3, 6, 44, 12, 32, 5]`:
- First, the list is sorted in ascending order: `[3, 5, 6, 12, 32, 44]`.
- Next, we sort the list based on the count of '1's in their binary representations:
  - `3` in binary is `11`, which has 2 '1's.
  - `5` in binary is `101`, which has 2 '1's.
  - `6` in binary is `110`, which has 2 '1's.
  - `12` in binary is `1100`, which has 2 '1's.
  - `32` in binary is `100000`, which has 1 '1'.
  - `44` in binary is `101100`, which has 3 '1's.
- Sorting by the count of '1's, we get: `[32, 3, 5, 6, 12, 44]`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `sort_array` on the input `[3, 6, 44, 12, 32, 5]` is `[32, 3, 5, 6, 12, 44]`.

[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def sort_array(arr):
    # [STATE] arr is initially [3, 6, 44, 12, 32, 5] [/STATE]
    # First sort by ascending order
    first_sort = sorted(arr)  # [STATE] first_sort is [3, 5, 6, 12, 32, 44] [/STATE]
    # Second sort by the count of '1's in the binary representation
    final_sort = sorted(first_sort, key=lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1'))  # [STATE] final_sort is [32, 3, 5, 6, 12, 44] [/STATE]
    return final_sort
