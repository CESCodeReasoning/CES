[REASONING]
The function `vowels_count` is called with the string "bye".
1. The variable `vowels` is initialized with the string "aeiouAEIOU".
2. The variable `n_vowels` is calculated using a generator expression that counts the vowels in the string "bye". The vowels in "bye" are 'e', so `n_vowels` is 1.
3. The function then checks if the last character of the string is 'y' or 'Y'. In this case, the last character of "bye" is 'e'.
   - The condition `(s[-1] == 'y')` is False.
   - The condition `(s[-1] == 'Y')` is also False.
   - Therefore, the combined condition `(s[-1] == 'y' or s[-1] == 'Y')` is False, and the branch is not taken.
4. Since the branch is not taken, `n_vowels` remains 1.
5. The function returns the value of `n_vowels`, which is 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("bye")` is 1.
