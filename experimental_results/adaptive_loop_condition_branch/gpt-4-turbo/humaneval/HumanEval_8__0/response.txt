[REASONING]
The function `sum_product` is called with an empty list `numbers = []`.
Inside the function, two variables `sum_value` and `prod_value` are initialized to 0 and 1 respectively.
Since the list `numbers` is empty, the loop does not execute any iterations.
Therefore, the values of `sum_value` and `prod_value` remain unchanged at 0 and 1 respectively.
The function returns a tuple containing `sum_value` and `prod_value`, which are 0 and 1.
[/REASONING]

[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    sum_value = 0
    prod_value = 1

    for n in numbers: ## [STATE]numbers=[][/STATE]
        sum_value += n
        prod_value *= n
    return sum_value, prod_value
[/PYTHON]
