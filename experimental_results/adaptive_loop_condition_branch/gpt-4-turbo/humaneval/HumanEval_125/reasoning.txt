The function `split_words` is called with the argument `txt = "Hello world!"`.
The function first checks if there is a space character " " in the input string `txt`.
- The condition `" " in txt` evaluates to True because there is a space between "Hello" and "world!".
- Since the condition is True, the first branch is taken.
- The `txt.split()` method is called, which splits the string at spaces, resulting in the list `['Hello', 'world!']`.
- The function returns this list.

The other conditions and branches are not evaluated because the first condition was met and the function returned in the first branch.

Therefore, the final output of the function `split_words("Hello world!")` is `['Hello', 'world!']`.
