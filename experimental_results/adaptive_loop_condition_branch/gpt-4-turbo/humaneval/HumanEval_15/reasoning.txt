The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string that contains a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n`, inclusive, separated by spaces. The sequence is generated using a list comprehension that iterates over a range from 0 to `n+1` (because the upper limit in Python's range function is exclusive). The numbers in the list are converted to strings and then joined into a single string with spaces separating the numbers.

For the input `n = 0`, the range will be from 0 to 1. The list comprehension will iterate over this range, producing a list containing the single number [0]. This list is then converted to the string "0" by the join method. Therefore, the output of executing `string_sequence` on the input `0` is "0".
