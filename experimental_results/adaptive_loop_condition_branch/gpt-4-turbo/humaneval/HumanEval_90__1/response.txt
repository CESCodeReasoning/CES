[REASONING]
The function `next_smallest` takes a list `lst` as input. The first operation inside the function is to convert the list to a set, which removes any duplicate elements, and then sort this set, storing the result back in `lst`. The sorted set is then converted back into a list. If the length of this new list is less than 2, the function returns `None` because there is no second smallest element to return. Otherwise, it returns the second element in the sorted list.

For the input `[]`, the steps are as follows:
1. Convert the empty list to a set, which remains an empty set.
2. Sort the empty set, which results in an empty list.
3. Check if the length of the list is less than 2. Since the list is empty, its length is 0, which is less than 2.
4. Return `None` because there are not enough elements to have a second smallest element.

Thus, the output for the input `[]` is `None`.

[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def next_smallest(lst):
    # [STATE] lst is initially [] [/STATE]
    lst = sorted(set(lst))
    # [STATE] lst is now [] after converting to set and sorting [/STATE]
    # [CONDITION] len(lst) < 2 is True [/CONDITION]
    # [BRANCH] Y [/BRANCH]
    return None if len(lst) < 2 else lst[1]
    # [STATE] return value is None [/STATE]
