[REASONING]
The function `encrypt` is called with the string "hi".
Inside the function, a string `d` containing the alphabet is defined, and an empty string `out` is initialized to store the result.

Iteration 1:
    - The character 'h' is in the alphabet string `d`.
    - The index of 'h' in `d` is 7. The encryption shifts this index by 4 (2*2), resulting in an index of 11.
    - The character at index 11 in `d` is 'l'.
    - 'l' is appended to `out`.

Iteration 2:
    - The character 'i' is in the alphabet string `d`.
    - The index of 'i' in `d` is 8. The encryption shifts this index by 4, resulting in an index of 12.
    - The character at index 12 in `d` is 'm'.
    - 'm' is appended to `out`.

The final encrypted string is "lm".

    d = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    out = ''
    for c in s: ## [STATE]c=['h', 'i'][/STATE][STATE]s=['hi'][/STATE]
        if c in d: ## [CONDITION](c in d)=[True, True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y, Y][/BRANCH]
            out += d[(d.index(c)+2*2) % 26]
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[N, N][/BRANCH]
            out += c
    return out
