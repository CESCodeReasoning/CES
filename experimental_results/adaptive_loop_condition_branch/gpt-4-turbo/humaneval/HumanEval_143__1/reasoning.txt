The function `words_in_sentence(sentence)` takes a string `sentence` as its parameter. The function processes the sentence to filter out words based on specific conditions and returns the filtered words as a single string.

The input sentence is "go for it". The function first splits this sentence into words, resulting in the list `['go', 'for', 'it']`.

The function then iterates over each word in the list:
1. For the word "go":
   - The length of "go" is 2. The condition `len(word) == 1` is False, so the branch is not taken.
   - The loop `for i in range(2, len(word))` does not execute because `range(2, 2)` is empty.
   - The condition `flg == 0 or len(word) == 2` evaluates to True because `len(word) == 2` is True. The word "go" is added to `new_lst`.

2. For the word "for":
   - The length of "for" is 3. The condition `len(word) == 1` is False, so the branch is not taken.
   - The loop `for i in range(2, len(word))` iterates with `i = 2`.
   - The condition `len(word) % i == 0` evaluates to True because 3 % 2 is 1 (False), so the branch is not taken.
   - The condition `flg == 0 or len(word) == 2` evaluates to False because `flg` is 0 and `len(word) == 2` is False. The word "for" is not added to `new_lst`.

3. For the word "it":
   - The length of "it" is 2. The condition `len(word) == 1` is False, so the branch is not taken.
   - The loop `for i in range(2, len(word))` does not execute because `range(2, 2)` is empty.
   - The condition `flg == 0 or len(word) == 2` evaluates to True because `len(word) == 2` is True. The word "it" is added to `new_lst`.

Finally, the function joins the words in `new_lst` ("go" and "it") into a single string separated by spaces and returns "go it".
