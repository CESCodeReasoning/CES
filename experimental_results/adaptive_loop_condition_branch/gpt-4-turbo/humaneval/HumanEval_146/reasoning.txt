The function `specialFilter` is called with the list `nums = [5, -2, 1, -5]`.
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The number `5` is not greater than `10`, so the condition `num > 10` is false.
    - The branch for `num > 10` is not taken.
Iteration 2:
    - The number `-2` is not greater than `10`, so the condition `num > 10` is false.
    - The branch for `num > 10` is not taken.
Iteration 3:
    - The number `1` is not greater than `10`, so the condition `num > 10` is false.
    - The branch for `num > 10` is not taken.
Iteration 4:
    - The number `-5` is not greater than `10`, so the condition `num > 10` is false.
    - The branch for `num > 10` is not taken.

Since none of the numbers in the list are greater than `10`, the inner condition to check if the first and last digits are odd is never evaluated. The `count` remains `0` throughout the function execution.

The function returns `0` as the final result since no numbers met the criteria specified in the function.
