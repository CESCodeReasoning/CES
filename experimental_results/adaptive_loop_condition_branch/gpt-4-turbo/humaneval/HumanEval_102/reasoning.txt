The function `choose_num` is called with parameters (x = 12, y = 15).
1. The first condition checks if `x > y`:
   - Since 12 is not greater than 15, this condition is false.
   - Therefore, the first branch is not taken.
2. The second condition checks if `y % 2 == 0`:
   - Since 15 % 2 equals 1, this condition is also false.
   - Therefore, the second branch is not taken.
3. The third condition checks if `x == y`:
   - Since 12 is not equal to 15, this condition is false.
   - Therefore, the third branch is not taken.
4. Since none of the conditions are met, the function reaches the final return statement, which returns `y - 1`.
   - Therefore, it returns 15 - 1 = 14.

Thus, the final output of the function `choose_num(12, 15)` is 14.
