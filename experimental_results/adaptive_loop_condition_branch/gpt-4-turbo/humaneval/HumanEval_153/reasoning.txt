The function `Strongest_Extension` is called with `class_name` set to 'Watashi' and `extensions` set to ['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe'].

1. The function initializes `strong` to the first element of `extensions`, which is 'tEN'.
2. `my_val` is calculated for 'tEN'. It counts the uppercase letters (E, N) and subtracts the count of lowercase letters (t). The result is 2 - 1 = 1.
3. The function then iterates over each string in `extensions`:
   - For 'tEN', `val` is recalculated as 1 (same as initial `my_val`). No change is made since `val` is not greater than `my_val`.
   - For 'niNE', `val` is calculated as 2 (N, E) - 2 (n, i) = 0. No change is made since `val` (0) is not greater than `my_val` (1).
   - For 'eIGHt8OKe', `val` is calculated as 4 (I, G, H, O) - 3 (e, t, k) = 1. No change is made since `val` (1) is not greater than `my_val` (1).
4. After iterating through all elements, the strongest extension remains 'tEN' with a `my_val` of 1.
5. The function concatenates `class_name` with the strongest extension using a dot separator, resulting in 'Watashi.tEN'.

Therefore, the output of the function `Strongest_Extension('Watashi', ['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe'])` is 'Watashi.tEN'.
