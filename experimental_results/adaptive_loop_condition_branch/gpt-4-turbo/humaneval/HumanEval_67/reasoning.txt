The function `fruit_distribution` is called with the string "5 apples and 6 oranges" and the number 19.
Inside the function:
1. The string is split into a list of words: `['5', 'apples', 'and', '6', 'oranges']`.
2. An empty list `lis` is initialized.
3. The function iterates over each word in the split list:
   - First Iteration (i = '5'):
     - '5' is a digit, so it is converted to integer and added to `lis` (lis = [5]).
   - Second Iteration (i = 'apples'):
     - 'apples' is not a digit, so it is skipped.
   - Third Iteration (i = 'and'):
     - 'and' is not a digit, so it is skipped.
   - Fourth Iteration (i = '6'):
     - '6' is a digit, so it is converted to integer and added to `lis` (lis = [5, 6]).
   - Fifth Iteration (i = 'oranges'):
     - 'oranges' is not a digit, so it is skipped.
4. The sum of the list `lis` (which contains [5, 6]) is calculated as 11.
5. The function returns `n - sum(lis)`, which is `19 - 11 = 8`.

Therefore, the output of the function `fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19)` is 8.
