[REASONING]
The function `pluck` is called with the list `[4, 2, 3]`.
1. The function first checks if the length of the array `arr` is 0. Since the length is 3, this condition is false.
2. The function then filters out even numbers from the array `arr`, resulting in the list `evens = [4, 2]`.
3. Next, the function checks if the `evens` list is empty. Since `evens` contains `[4, 2]`, this condition is also false.
4. The function then proceeds to find the minimum value in the `evens` list, which is `2`, and its index in the original array `arr`, which is `1`.
5. Finally, the function returns a list containing the minimum value from the `evens` list and its index in the original array, which is `[2, 1]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `pluck([4, 2, 3])` is `[2, 1]`.

[PYTHON]
from typing import *

    if(len(arr) == 0): return [] ## [CONDITION](len(arr) == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
    evens = list(filter(lambda x: x%2 == 0, arr))
    if(evens == []): return [] ## [CONDITION](evens == [])=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
    return [min(evens), arr.index(min(evens))]
