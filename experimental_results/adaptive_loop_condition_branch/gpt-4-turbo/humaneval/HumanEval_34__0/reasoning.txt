The function `unique` takes a list `l` as input. The purpose of this function is to return a new list that contains only unique elements from the input list, and these elements are sorted in ascending order.
1. The function first converts the list `l` into a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements because sets do not allow duplicates.
2. This set is then converted back into a list.
3. Finally, this list is sorted in ascending order using the `sorted()` function.
For the input `['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd']`, the steps are as follows:
- Convert to set: `{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}`
- Convert set back to list: `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`
- Sort the list: `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']` (Note: The list is already sorted in this case, but the sorting step ensures order for any input.)
Thus, the output of the function for the given input is `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`.
