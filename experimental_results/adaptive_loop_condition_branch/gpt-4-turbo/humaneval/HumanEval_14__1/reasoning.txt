The function `all_prefixes` is called with an empty string (`string = ''`).
Inside the function, a list `result` is initialized to an empty list.
The length of the input string is calculated using `len(string)`, which is 0 because the string is empty.
The `range(len(string))` results in `range(0)`, which means the loop does not iterate at all because there are no elements in the range.
Since the loop does not execute, the `result` list remains empty.
The function returns the `result` list, which is an empty list.
