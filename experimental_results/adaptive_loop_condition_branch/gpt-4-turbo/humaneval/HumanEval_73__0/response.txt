[REASONING]
The function `smallest_change` is called with the array `arr = [1, 4, 2]`.
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The length of the array `arr` is 3, so `len(arr) // 2` evaluates to 1. This means the loop will iterate once (i.e., for `i = 0`).

Iteration 1 (i = 0):
   - The elements being compared are `arr[0]` and `arr[2]` (i.e., 1 and 2).
   - Since 1 is not equal to 2, the condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true.
   - Action: `ans` is incremented by 1, resulting in `ans = 1`.

The loop completes after one iteration as the range was only up to 1. The function then returns the value of `ans`, which is 1.

Therefore, the output of the function `smallest_change([1, 4, 2])` is 1.

    for i in range(len(arr) // 2): ## [STATE]i=[0][/STATE][STATE]range((len(arr) // 2))=[0][/STATE][STATE](len(arr) // 2)=[1][/STATE]
        if arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]: ## [CONDITION](arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1])=[True][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
            ans += 1
    return ans
