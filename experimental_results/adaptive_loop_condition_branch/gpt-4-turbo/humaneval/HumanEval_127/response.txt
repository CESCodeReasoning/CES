[REASONING]
The function `intersection` is called with two intervals: `interval1 = (1, 2)` and `interval2 = (2, 3)`.
Inside the function:
1. The variable `l` is calculated as the maximum of the starting points of the two intervals, which is `max(1, 2) = 2`.
2. The variable `r` is calculated as the minimum of the ending points of the two intervals, which is `min(2, 3) = 2`.
3. The `length` of the intersection is calculated as `r - l = 2 - 2 = 0`.

The function then checks if `length > 0` and if `length` is a prime number:
- Since `length = 0`, the condition `length > 0` is false.
- The function `is_prime` is not called because the first part of the condition (`length > 0`) is already false.

Since the condition `length > 0 and is_prime(length)` is false, the function returns "NO".
