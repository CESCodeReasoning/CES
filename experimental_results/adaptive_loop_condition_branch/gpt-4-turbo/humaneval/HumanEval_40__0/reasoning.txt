The function `triples_sum_to_zero(l)` takes a list `l` of integers ([1, 2, 3, 7]) as its parameter. The function checks if any three distinct elements in the list sum to zero.

The outer loop iterates over each element in the list using index `i`.
The middle loop iterates over the elements following the `i`th element using index `j`.
The inner loop iterates over the elements following the `j`th element using index `k`.

For each combination of `i`, `j`, and `k`, the function checks if the sum of `l[i]`, `l[j]`, and `l[k]` equals zero.

Here's the detailed iteration:
- First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, `j` in the middle loop is 1, 2, and 3.
    - For `j` = 1, `k` in the inner loop is 2 and 3.
        - When `k` = 2, the sum is `l[0] + l[1] + l[2]` = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is not zero.
        - When `k` = 3, the sum is `l[0] + l[1] + l[3]` = 1 + 2 + 7 = 10, which is not zero.
    - For `j` = 2, `k` in the inner loop is 3.
        - The sum is `l[0] + l[2] + l[3]` = 1 + 3 + 7 = 11, which is not zero.
- Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, `j` in the middle loop is 2 and 3.
    - For `j` = 2, `k` in the inner loop is 3.
        - The sum is `l[1] + l[2] + l[3]` = 2 + 3 + 7 = 12, which is not zero.
- Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, `j` in the middle loop is 3.
    - There are no more elements for `k` to iterate over.

Since no combination of three elements sums to zero, the function returns `False`.
