The function `how_many_times` is called with the parameters (string = "xyxyxyx" and substring = "x").
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of times the substring appears in the string.

The loop iterates from 0 to the length of the string minus the length of the substring plus one. This is calculated as follows:
- Length of string = 7 ("xyxyxyx")
- Length of substring = 1 ("x")
- Thus, the loop runs from 0 to (7 - 1 + 1) = 7.

Iteration 0:
   - The substring from index 0 to 1 ("x") matches the substring "x".
   - The condition is true, so `times` is incremented to 1.

Iteration 1:
   - The substring from index 1 to 2 ("y") does not match "x".
   - The condition is false, so `times` remains 1.

Iteration 2:
   - The substring from index 2 to 3 ("x") matches "x".
   - The condition is true, so `times` is incremented to 2.

Iteration 3:
   - The substring from index 3 to 4 ("y") does not match "x".
   - The condition is false, so `times` remains 2.

Iteration 4:
   - The substring from index 4 to 5 ("x") matches "x".
   - The condition is true, so `times` is incremented to 3.

Iteration 5:
   - The substring from index 5 to 6 ("y") does not match "x".
   - The condition is false, so `times` remains 3.

Iteration 6:
   - The substring from index 6 to 7 ("x") matches "x".
   - The condition is true, so `times` is incremented to 4.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `times`, which is now 4.

Therefore, the final output of the function `how_many_times('xyxyxyx', 'x')` is 4.
