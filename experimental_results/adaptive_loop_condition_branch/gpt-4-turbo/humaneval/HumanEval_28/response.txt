[REASONING]
The function `concatenate` takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that is the result of joining all the strings in the list without any separator.
To determine the output of executing the function `concatenate` on the input `['x', 'y', 'z']`, we need to join the strings "x", "y", and "z" together.
The `join` method is called on an empty string `''`, which acts as the separator between the elements of the list. Since the separator is an empty string, the elements of the list are concatenated directly next to each other.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `concatenate` on the input `['x', 'y', 'z']` is "xyz".
[REASONING]

[ANSWER]
```python
from typing import *

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    # [STATE] strings = ['x', 'y', 'z'] [/STATE]
    return ''.join(strings)  # [STATE] return value of ''.join(strings) = 'xyz' [/STATE]
```
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
"xyz"
[/OUTPUT]
