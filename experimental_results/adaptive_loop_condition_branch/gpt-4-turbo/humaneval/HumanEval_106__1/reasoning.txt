The function `f(n)` takes an integer `n` and initializes an empty list `ret`. It then iterates from 1 through `n` inclusive. For each iteration:
- If `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`), it initializes `x` to 1 and calculates the factorial of `i` by iterating from 1 to `i` and multiplying `x` by each `j`. The result is appended to `ret`.
- If `i` is odd, it initializes `x` to 0 and calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to `i` by iterating from 1 to `i` and adding each `j` to `x`. The result is appended to `ret`.

For `n = 7`, the iterations are as follows:
1. `i = 1` (odd): Sum of numbers from 1 to 1 is 1.
2. `i = 2` (even): Factorial of 2 is 2.
3. `i = 3` (odd): Sum of numbers from 1 to 3 is 6.
4. `i = 4` (even): Factorial of 4 is 24.
5. `i = 5` (odd): Sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is 15.
6. `i = 6` (even): Factorial of 6 is 720.
7. `i = 7` (odd): Sum of numbers from 1 to 7 is 28.

The function returns the list `[1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28]`.
