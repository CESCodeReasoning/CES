[REASONING]
The function `correct_bracketing` is called with the input string "(()())".
The function checks if the brackets in the string are correctly nested and balanced.

1. Initialize `depth` to 0.
2. Iterate over each character in the string:
   - First character '(' increases `depth` to 1.
   - Second character '(' increases `depth` to 2.
   - Third character ')' decreases `depth` to 1.
   - Fourth character '(' increases `depth` to 2.
   - Fifth character ')' decreases `depth` to 1.
   - Sixth character ')' decreases `depth` to 0.
3. After the loop, check if `depth` equals 0, which it does, indicating that the brackets are correctly nested and balanced.

Therefore, the function returns `True`, indicating that the input string "(()())" is correctly bracketed.
