The function `sum_to_n` takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of all integers from 0 to `n` inclusive. This is achieved by using the `range` function which generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n`, and the `sum` function which calculates the sum of these numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function `sum_to_n` on the input `6`, we need to calculate the sum of the numbers from 0 to 6. This sequence is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
The sum of these numbers is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `sum_to_n` on the input `6` is 21.
