The function `x_or_y` is called with the arguments (n = 91, x = 56, y = 129).
The function first checks if `n` is equal to 1. Since `n` is 91, this condition is false, and the branch is not taken.
Next, the function enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `n-1` (i.e., from 2 to 90).
During each iteration, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `n % i == 0`).
    - When `i` is 7, `91 % 7` equals 0, indicating that 91 is divisible by 7.
    - As a result, the function returns `y` (which is 129) and exits the loop.
Since the function finds a divisor of `n` within the loop, it does not reach the `else` block that would return `x`.

Therefore, the output of the function `x_or_y(91, 56, 129)` is 129.
