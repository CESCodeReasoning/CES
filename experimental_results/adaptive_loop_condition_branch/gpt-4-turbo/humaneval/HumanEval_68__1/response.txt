[REASONING]
The function `pluck` is called with the array `[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]`.
1. First, the function checks if the array is empty. Since the array has elements, the condition `(len(arr) == 0)` is false, so this branch is not taken.
2. Next, the function filters out even numbers from the array using a lambda function. The even numbers in the array `[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]` are `[0, 0, 4, 2]`.
3. The function then checks if the list of even numbers is empty. Since the list `[0, 0, 4, 2]` is not empty, the condition `(evens == [])` is false, so this branch is not taken.
4. Finally, the function returns a list containing the minimum value from the list of even numbers and the index of this minimum value in the original array. The minimum value among the even numbers `[0, 0, 4, 2]` is `0`, and its index in the original array `[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]` is `1`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])` is `[0, 1]`.

from typing import *

def pluck(arr):
    if (len(arr) == 0): ## [CONDITION](len(arr) == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return []
    evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, arr))
    if (evens == []): ## [CONDITION](evens == [])=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return []
    return [min(evens), arr.index(min(evens))]
