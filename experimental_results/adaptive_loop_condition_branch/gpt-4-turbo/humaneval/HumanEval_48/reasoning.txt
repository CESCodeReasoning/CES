The function `is_palindrome` is called with the input string 'xywyx'.
The function checks if the input string is a palindrome by comparing characters symmetrically from the start and end towards the center.

1. The length of the string 'xywyx' is 5.
2. The loop iterates from 0 to 4 (inclusive).

Iteration 1 (i = 0):
   - Compare the first character 'x' with the last character 'x'.
   - They are equal, so continue to the next iteration.

Iteration 2 (i = 1):
   - Compare the second character 'y' with the second last character 'y'.
   - They are equal, so continue to the next iteration.

Iteration 3 (i = 2):
   - Compare the middle character 'w' with itself.
   - They are equal, so continue to the next iteration.

Iteration 4 (i = 3):
   - This iteration is not needed as the comparison is symmetric and has already been checked in previous iterations.

Iteration 5 (i = 4):
   - This iteration is not needed as the comparison is symmetric and has already been checked in previous iterations.

Since all corresponding characters match, the function concludes that the string 'xywyx' is a palindrome and returns True.
