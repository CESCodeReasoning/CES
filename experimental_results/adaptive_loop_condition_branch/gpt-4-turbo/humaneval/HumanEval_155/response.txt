[REASONING]
The function `even_odd_count` is called with the argument `num = 7`.
Inside the function:
- `even_count` and `odd_count` are initialized to 0.
- The absolute value of `num` is taken, which is 7 (since 7 is positive, its absolute value is itself).
- This number is converted to a string, resulting in "7".
- The loop iterates over the string "7".

Iteration:
- The character '7' is converted back to an integer and checked if it is even or odd.
- Since 7 % 2 equals 1, which is not equal to 0, the number 7 is odd.
- The `else` branch is taken, and `odd_count` is incremented by 1.

After the loop, the function returns a tuple `(even_count, odd_count)`, which is `(0, 1)` because there were no even numbers and one odd number in the input.

    for i in str(abs(num)): ## [STATE]i=['7'][/STATE][STATE]str(abs(num))=['7'][/STATE][STATE]abs(num)=7[/STATE]
        if int(i) % 2 == 0: ## [CONDITION](int(i) % 2 == 0)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
            even_count += 1
        else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
            odd_count += 1
    return (even_count, odd_count)
