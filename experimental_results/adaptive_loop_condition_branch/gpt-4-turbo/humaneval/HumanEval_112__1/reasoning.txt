The function `reverse_delete` takes two parameters: a string `s` and a string `c`. The function first filters out all characters in `s` that are present in `c`, creating a new string. This is done using a list comprehension that iterates through each character in `s` and includes it in the new list only if it is not found in `c`. The list of characters is then joined back into a string.

After filtering, the function checks if the resulting string is a palindrome by comparing the string with its reverse (`s[::-1]`). The function returns a tuple containing the filtered string and a boolean indicating whether the filtered string is a palindrome.

For the input `reverse_delete("mamma", "mia")`:
1. The characters 'm', 'i', and 'a' from "mamma" are removed because they are present in "mia".
2. The resulting string after filtering is an empty string "".
3. The reverse of "" is also "", which is trivially a palindrome.

Thus, the output will be a tuple containing the empty string and `True` indicating that the empty string is a palindrome.
