[REASONING]
The function `intersection` is called with two intervals: `interval1 = [-2, -2]` and `interval2 = [-3, -2]`.
1. The function calculates the maximum of the starting points of the intervals, which is `max(-2, -3) = -2`.
2. It then calculates the minimum of the ending points of the intervals, which is `min(-2, -2) = -2`.
3. The length of the intersection is calculated as `r - l = -2 - (-2) = 0`.
4. The function checks if the length is greater than 0 and if the length is a prime number. Since the length is 0, the condition `(length > 0)` is false.
5. Since the first part of the condition `(length > 0)` is false, the function does not need to check if the length is prime, and it does not enter the branch that would return "YES".
6. The function returns "NO" because the length of the intersection is not greater than 0 and not a prime number.

Therefore, the output of the function `intersection([-2, -2], [-3, -2])` is "NO".
