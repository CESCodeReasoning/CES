[REASONING]
The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is rescaled to a unit interval [0, 1]. This is achieved by subtracting the minimum value of the list from each element, and then dividing by the range of the list (difference between the maximum and minimum values).

For the input list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]:
1. The minimum value (`min_number`) is 1.0.
2. The maximum value (`max_number`) is 5.0.
3. The range of the list is 5.0 - 1.0 = 4.0.
4. Each element in the list is transformed as follows:
   - (1.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 0.0
   - (2.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 0.25
   - (3.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 0.5
   - (4.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 0.75
   - (5.0 - 1.0) / 4.0 = 1.0

Thus, the output list after rescaling is [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0].
