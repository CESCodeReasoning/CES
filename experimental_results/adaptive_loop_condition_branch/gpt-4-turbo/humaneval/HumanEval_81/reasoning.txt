The function `numerical_letter_grade` is called with the list of grades `[4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]`.
Inside the function, an empty list `letter_grade` is initialized to store the corresponding letter grades for each GPA.

Iteration 1:
    - The GPA is 4.0, which exactly matches the condition `gpa == 4.0`.
    - The letter grade "A+" is appended to the list.

Iteration 2:
    - The GPA is 3, which does not match any of the conditions until `gpa > 2.7`.
    - The letter grade "B" is appended to the list.

Iteration 3:
    - The GPA is 1.7, which matches the condition `gpa > 1.7`.
    - The letter grade "C" is appended to the list.

Iteration 4:
    - The GPA is 2, which matches the condition `gpa > 1.7`.
    - The letter grade "C" is appended to the list.

Iteration 5:
    - The GPA is 3.5, which matches the condition `gpa > 3.3`.
    - The letter grade "A-" is appended to the list.

After iterating through all the GPAs, the function returns the list of letter grades corresponding to each GPA.
