The function `decimal_to_binary` takes an integer `decimal` as input and converts it to a binary string. The built-in Python function `bin()` is used to convert the integer to a binary representation. The `bin()` function returns a string that starts with '0b', which represents that the number is in binary format. The slicing `[2:]` is used to remove the '0b' prefix from the binary string. The function then concatenates "db" at the beginning and end of the binary string to form the final result.
For the input 0, the `bin()` function returns '0b0'. After slicing, the result is '0'. Concatenating "db" at the beginning and end results in "db0db".
Therefore, the output of executing the function `decimal_to_binary` on the input 0 is "db0db".
