The function `get_odd_collatz` is called with `n = 1`.
- Initially, the condition `(n % 2 == 0)` is checked. Since `1 % 2` equals `1`, which is not equal to `0`, the condition is false. Therefore, the first branch (`if n % 2 == 0`) is not taken.
- The `else` branch is taken because `n % 2` is not `0`. The list `odd_collatz` is initialized with `[1]`.
- The `while` loop condition `(n > 1)` is checked. Since `n = 1`, which is not greater than `1`, the loop does not execute.
- The function returns the sorted list `odd_collatz`, which contains `[1]`.

Thus, the output of the function call `get_odd_collatz(1)` is `[1]`.
