The function `Strongest_Extension` is called with `class_name = 'Sp'` and `extensions = ['671235', 'Bb']`.
The function aims to find the extension with the strongest "strength" defined by the difference between the count of uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters.

1. The variable `strong` is initialized to the first element of the extensions list, which is '671235'.
2. `my_val` is calculated for '671235'. Since it contains no alphabetic characters, both counts of uppercase and lowercase characters are 0, resulting in `my_val = 0`.

3. The loop iterates over each string in the `extensions` list:
   - First Iteration (`s = '671235'`):
     - `val` is recalculated for '671235', which is again 0.
     - The condition `val > my_val` (0 > 0) is false, so no change is made.
   - Second Iteration (`s = 'Bb'`):
     - `val` is calculated for 'Bb'. It has 1 uppercase ('B') and 1 lowercase ('b'), resulting in `val = 0`.
     - The condition `val > my_val` (0 > 0) is again false, so no change is made.

4. After the loop, the `strong` variable remains '671235', and the final answer is constructed by concatenating `class_name` with `strong`, resulting in 'Sp.671235'.

Therefore, the output of the function `Strongest_Extension('Sp', ['671235', 'Bb'])` is 'Sp.671235'.
