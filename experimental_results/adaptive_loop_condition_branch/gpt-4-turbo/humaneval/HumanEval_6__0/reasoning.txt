The function `parse_nested_parens` is called with the input string `((()))`.
The function first defines a nested function `parse_paren_group` which calculates the maximum depth of nested parentheses in a given string segment.

Here's the step-by-step execution:
1. The input string `((()))` does not contain any spaces, so the `split(' ')` method results in a list containing the single element `((()))`.
2. The list comprehension iterates over this list, and for each element (in this case, just one), it calls `parse_paren_group`.
3. Inside `parse_paren_group`, the variables `depth` and `max_depth` are initialized to 0.
4. The function then iterates over each character in the string `((()))`:
   - For each '(', `depth` is incremented by 1 and `max_depth` is updated if `depth` exceeds the current `max_depth`.
   - For each ')', `depth` is decremented by 1.
5. The characters are processed as follows:
   - '(' increases depth to 1, max_depth becomes 1.
   - '(' increases depth to 2, max_depth becomes 2.
   - '(' increases depth to 3, max_depth becomes 3.
   - ')' decreases depth to 2.
   - ')' decreases depth to 1.
   - ')' decreases depth to 0.
6. The maximum depth recorded is 3, which is returned by `parse_paren_group`.
7. The list comprehension collects this value into a list, resulting in `[3]`.

Therefore, the output of the function `parse_nested_parens('((()))')` is `[3]`.
