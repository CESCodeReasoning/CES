The function `digitSum` is called with the string "abcCd".
1. The function first checks if the input string `s` is empty. In this case, `s` is "abcCd", so it is not empty.
   - The condition `(s == "")` evaluates to False.
   - Therefore, the branch for the empty string is not taken.
2. The function proceeds to calculate the sum of the ASCII values of uppercase characters in the string. It uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
   - The characters in "abcCd" are evaluated one by one:
     - 'a' is lowercase, contributes 0.
     - 'b' is lowercase, contributes 0.
     - 'c' is lowercase, contributes 0.
     - 'C' is uppercase, contributes its ASCII value (67).
     - 'd' is lowercase, contributes 0.
   - The sum of these values is 67.
3. The function returns the sum, which is 67.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digitSum("abcCd")` is 67.
