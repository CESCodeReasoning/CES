The function `compare_one` is called with the arguments `a = "1"` and `b = "2"`.
- Both `a` and `b` are strings, so the conditions `isinstance(temp_a, str)` and `isinstance(temp_b, str)` are both true.
- Since both conditions are true, both `temp_a` and `temp_b` remain unchanged as they do not contain commas to replace with dots.
- The comparison `float(temp_a) == float(temp_b)` is then evaluated. Since `float("1")` is 1.0 and `float("2")` is 2.0, the condition is false.
- The function then checks if `float(temp_a) > float(temp_b)`. Since 1.0 is not greater than 2.0, it returns `b`, which is "2".

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one("1", "2")` is "2".
