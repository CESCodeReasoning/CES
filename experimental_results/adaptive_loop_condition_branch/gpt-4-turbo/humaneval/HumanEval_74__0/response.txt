[REASONING]
The function `total_match` is called with `lst1 = ['4']` and `lst2 = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`.
Inside the function, two variables `l1` and `l2` are initialized to 0. These variables will store the total length of the strings in `lst1` and `lst2` respectively.

First, the function iterates over `lst1`:
- For `st = '4'`, `len(st)` is 1. Thus, `l1` is updated to 1 (0 + 1).

Next, the function iterates over `lst2`:
- For `st = '1'`, `len(st)` is 1. Thus, `l2` is updated to 1 (0 + 1).
- For `st = '2'`, `len(st)` is 1. Thus, `l2` is updated to 2 (1 + 1).
- For `st = '3'`, `len(st)` is 1. Thus, `l2` is updated to 3 (2 + 1).
- For `st = '4'`, `len(st)` is 1. Thus, `l2` is updated to 4 (3 + 1).
- For `st = '5'`, `len(st)` is 1. Thus, `l2` is updated to 5 (4 + 1).

After the loops, the condition `l1 <= l2` (1 <= 5) is evaluated to `True`. Therefore, the if branch is taken and the function returns `lst1` as the output.
