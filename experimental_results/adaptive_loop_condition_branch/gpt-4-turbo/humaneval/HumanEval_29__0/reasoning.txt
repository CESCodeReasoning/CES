The function `filter_by_prefix` takes two parameters: a list of strings `strings` and a string `prefix`. It returns a new list containing only those strings from the input list that start with the specified prefix.
To determine the output of executing the function `filter_by_prefix` on the input list `['abc', 'abcd', 'abcde']` with the prefix `'abc'`, we need to check each string in the list to see if it starts with the prefix `'abc'`.

1. The string 'abc' starts with 'abc', so it is included in the result.
2. The string 'abcd' also starts with 'abc', so it is included in the result.
3. The string 'abcde' starts with 'abc' as well, so it is included in the result.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `filter_by_prefix` on the given input is `['abc', 'abcd', 'abcde']`.
