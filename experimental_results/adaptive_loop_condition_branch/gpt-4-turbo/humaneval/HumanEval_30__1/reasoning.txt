The function `get_positive` takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list containing only the elements from `l` that are greater than 0. This is achieved using a list comprehension that iterates over each element `e` in the list `l` and includes `e` in the new list if `e > 0`.

To determine the output of executing the function `get_positive` on the input `[-1, -2]`, we need to check each element in the list:
- For `e = -1`, the condition `e > 0` is false, so `-1` is not included in the new list.
- For `e = -2`, the condition `e > 0` is also false, so `-2` is not included in the new list.

Since no elements satisfy the condition `e > 0`, the output list is empty.
