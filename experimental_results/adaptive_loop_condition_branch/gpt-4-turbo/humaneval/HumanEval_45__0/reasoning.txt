The function `triangle_area` calculates the area of a triangle given the base `a` and the height `h`. The formula for the area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2. 
For the input values `a = 10` and `h = 8`, the calculation proceeds as follows:
1. Multiply the base `a` (10) by the height `h` (8), which results in 80.
2. Divide the result (80) by 2.0 to get the area of the triangle, which is 40.0.
Thus, the output of executing the function `triangle_area` on the inputs 10 and 8 is 40.0.
