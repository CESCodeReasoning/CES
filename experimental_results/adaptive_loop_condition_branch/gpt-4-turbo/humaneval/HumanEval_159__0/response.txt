[REASONING]
The function `eat` is called with the arguments `number = 4`, `need = 5`, and `remaining = 1`.
The function checks if the `need` (5) is less than or equal to `remaining` (1).
- The condition `(need <= remaining)` evaluates to `False` because 5 is greater than 1.
Since the condition is `False`, the `else` branch is taken.
- In the `else` branch, the function returns `[number + remaining, 0]`.
- This results in `[4 + 1, 0]` which simplifies to `[5, 0]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `eat(4, 5, 1)` is `[5, 0]`.

[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def eat(number, need, remaining):
    if (need <= remaining): ## [CONDITION](need <= remaining)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return [number + need, remaining - need]
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return [number + remaining, 0]

[5, 0]
