[REASONING]
The function `remove_vowels` is designed to take a string `text` as input and return a new string that excludes all vowels from the input string. The vowels considered are "a", "e", "i", "o", and "u", both in lowercase and uppercase forms.

To achieve this, the function uses a list comprehension that iterates over each character `s` in the input string `text`. For each character, it checks if `s.lower()` is not in the list of vowels ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]. If the character is not a vowel, it is included in the list generated by the list comprehension.

The list of non-vowel characters is then joined back into a string using `"".join()`, which concatenates all the elements of the list into a single string.

For the input 'ybcd', the function will check each character:
- 'y' is not in the list of vowels, so it is included.
- 'b' is not in the list of vowels, so it is included.
- 'c' is not in the list of vowels, so it is included.
- 'd' is not in the list of vowels, so it is included.

Since none of the characters in 'ybcd' are vowels, all characters are included in the final string, which remains 'ybcd'.

from typing import *

def remove_vowels(text: str) -> str:
    # [STATE] text = 'ybcd' [/STATE]
    return "".join([s for s in text if s.lower()  # [STATE] s = 'd' [/STATE]
                   not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]])  # [CONDITION] s.lower() not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"] [/CONDITION]
# [BRANCH] Y [/BRANCH] (All characters are processed and included since none are vowels)
