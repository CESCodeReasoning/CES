The function `hex_key` is called with the string "AB".
Inside the function, a tuple `primes` is defined containing the characters '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'.
A variable `total` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the count of characters in `num` that are also in `primes`.

Iteration 1:
    - The character at index 0 is 'A', which is not in `primes`.
    - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
    - No increment to `total`.
Iteration 2:
    - The character at index 1 is 'B', which is in `primes`.
    - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
    - `total` is incremented by 1.

After iterating through the string, the function returns the value of `total`, which is 1, as only 'B' from the input string "AB" is found in the `primes` tuple.
