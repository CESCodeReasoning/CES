The function `f(n)` takes an integer `n` and initializes an empty list `ret`. It iterates from 1 through `n` inclusive. For each iteration:
- If `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`), it initializes `x` to 1 and then iterates from 1 through `i` inclusive, multiplying `x` by each `j`. The result is appended to `ret`.
- If `i` is odd, it initializes `x` to 0 and then iterates from 1 through `i` inclusive, adding each `j` to `x`. The result is appended to `ret`.

For the input `f(3)`:
- `i = 1` (odd): `x` starts at 0, iterates through `j = 1`, and `x` becomes 1. Append 1 to `ret`.
- `i = 2` (even): `x` starts at 1, iterates through `j = 1, 2`, and `x` becomes 2 (1*1*2). Append 2 to `ret`.
- `i = 3` (odd): `x` starts at 0, iterates through `j = 1, 2, 3`, and `x` becomes 6 (0+1+2+3). Append 6 to `ret`.

The final list `ret` is `[1, 2, 6]`.
