The function `sort_numbers` takes a string of number words as input and returns a string of these number words sorted according to their numeric values. The function uses a dictionary `value_map` to map number words to their corresponding numeric values.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the function execution for the input 'five zero four seven nine eight':
1. The input string 'five zero four seven nine eight' is split into a list of words: ['five', 'zero', 'four', 'seven', 'nine', 'eight'].
2. The list comprehension `[x for x in numbers.split(' ') if x]` filters out any empty strings, but since there are none in this case, it simply converts the split result into a list.
3. The `sorted` function sorts this list based on a key. The key for each word is obtained by looking up its numeric value in the `value_map` dictionary.
4. The lambda function `lambda x: value_map[x]` is used to fetch the numeric value of each word from the `value_map`.
5. The words are sorted numerically based on these values, resulting in the list ['zero', 'four', 'five', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine'].
6. Finally, the sorted list of words is joined back into a single string with spaces separating the words, resulting in 'zero four five seven eight nine'.

Thus, the output of the function for the given input is 'zero four five seven eight nine'.
