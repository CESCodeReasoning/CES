The function `is_simple_power` is called with the arguments (x = 1, n = 1).
The first conditional statement checks if `n` is equal to 1. In this case, since `n` is indeed 1, the condition `(n == 1)` evaluates to `True`.
As a result, the branch inside this condition is taken. The function then checks if `x` is equal to 1, which it is. Therefore, the function returns `True`.
Since the condition was met and the function returned early, the while loop and any subsequent logic are not executed.
