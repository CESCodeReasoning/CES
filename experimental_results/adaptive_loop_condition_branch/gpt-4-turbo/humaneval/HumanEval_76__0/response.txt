[REASONING]
The function `is_simple_power` is called with the arguments (x = 1, n = 1).
The first conditional statement checks if `n` is equal to 1. In this case, since `n` is indeed 1, the condition `(n == 1)` evaluates to `True`.
As a result, the branch inside this condition is taken. The function then checks if `x` is equal to 1, which it is. Therefore, the function returns `True`.
Since the condition was met and the function returned early, the while loop and any subsequent logic are not executed.

[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def is_simple_power(x, n):
    if (n == 1): ## [CONDITION](n == 1)=True[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=Y[/BRANCH]
        return (x == 1)  # Since x is 1, this returns True
    power = 1
    while (power < x): ## [STATE](power < x)=??[/STATE][STATE]power=??[/STATE][STATE]x=??[/STATE]
        power = power * n
    return (power == x)
