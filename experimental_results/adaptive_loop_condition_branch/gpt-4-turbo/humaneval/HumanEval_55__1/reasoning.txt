The function `fib` is called with ( n = 11 ).
This function calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

1. For `n = 11`, neither `n == 0` nor `n == 1` is true, so neither of the first two if conditions are met. The function proceeds to recursively call itself with `n - 1` and `n - 2`.
2. This pattern continues, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems (`fib(10)` and `fib(9)`), until the base cases are reached:
   - `fib(0)` returns 0.
   - `fib(1)` returns 1.
3. The results of these base cases are then used to build up the solution to the original problem through the addition of results from recursive calls.
4. The recursive tree expands significantly due to the nature of the Fibonacci sequence calculation, where each call generates two more calls until the base cases are reached.
5. The final result is computed by summing up the appropriate Fibonacci numbers as per the recursive formula: `fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fib(11)` is 89, which is the 11th Fibonacci number.
