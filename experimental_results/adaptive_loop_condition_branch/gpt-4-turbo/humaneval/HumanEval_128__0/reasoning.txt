The function `prod_signs` is called with the array `arr = [-1, 1, 1, 1]`.
1. The function first checks if the array is empty. Since `arr` is not empty, the condition `(not arr)` evaluates to `False`, and the corresponding branch is not taken.
2. Next, the function checks if `0` is in the array using `0 in arr`, which evaluates to `False`. Therefore, the product `prod` is calculated using the expression `(-1) ** len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr)))`. Here, the `filter` function filters out the negative numbers from `arr`, resulting in a list `[-1]`. The length of this list is `1`, so `(-1) ** 1` equals `-1`.
3. The function then computes the sum of the absolute values of the elements in `arr` using the list comprehension `[abs(i) for i in arr]`, which results in `[1, 1, 1, 1]` and the sum of this list is `4`.
4. Finally, the function returns the product of `prod` and the sum of absolute values, which is `-1 * 4 = -4`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `prod_signs([-1, 1, 1, 1])` is `-4`.
