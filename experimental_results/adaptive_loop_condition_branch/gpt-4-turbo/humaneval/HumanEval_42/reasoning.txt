The function `incr_list` takes a list of integers `l` as input and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `e` in the list `l`, adding 1 to each element and collecting the results into a new list.
To determine the output of executing the function `incr_list` on the input `[5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`, we perform the following steps:
1. Add 1 to 5, resulting in 6.
2. Add 1 to 2, resulting in 3.
3. Add 1 to 5, resulting in 6.
4. Add 1 to 2, resulting in 3.
5. Add 1 to 3, resulting in 4.
6. Add 1 to 3, resulting in 4.
7. Add 1 to 9, resulting in 10.
8. Add 1 to 0, resulting in 1.
9. Add 1 to 123, resulting in 124.
The output list, therefore, is `[6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]`.
