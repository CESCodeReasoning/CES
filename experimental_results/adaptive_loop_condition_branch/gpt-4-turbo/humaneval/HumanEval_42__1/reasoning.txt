The function `incr_list` takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list where each element of the input list is incremented by 1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `e` in the list `l`, adding 1 to `e` and collecting the results into a new list.

In this specific case, the input to the function is an empty list `[]`. When the list comprehension is executed on an empty list, there are no elements to iterate over. Therefore, the list comprehension produces an empty list as well.

Thus, the output of executing the function `incr_list` on the input `[]` is an empty list `[]`.
