The function `sum_squares` is called with the list `[0]`.
Inside the function:
- A variable `result` is initialized as an empty list.
- The function iterates over the indices of the list, which in this case is just one element, so the loop will run once with `i = 0`.

Iteration 1 (i = 0):
   - The length of the list `lst` is 1, so `range(len(lst))` generates the range [0].
   - The condition `i % 3 == 0` is checked. Since `0 % 3` equals 0, the condition is true.
   - The value at index 0 of the list `lst` is squared (`0**2`), which is 0, and this value is appended to the `result` list.
   - The `elif` condition is not checked because the first condition was true.

After the loop, the function returns the sum of the `result` list, which contains only one element: 0. Therefore, the sum is 0.

Thus, the output of the function `sum_squares([0])` is 0.
