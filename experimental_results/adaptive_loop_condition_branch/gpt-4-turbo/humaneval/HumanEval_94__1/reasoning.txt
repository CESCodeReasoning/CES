The function `skjkasdkd` is called with the list `[0, 8, 1, 2, 1, 7]`.
Inside the function:
- A nested function `isPrime(n)` is defined to check if a number `n` is prime.
- A variable `maxx` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the maximum prime number found in the list.
- A variable `i` is initialized to 0 to iterate through the list.

The loop iterates over the indices of the list:
- First Iteration (i = 0):
  - The number 0 is not greater than `maxx` (0), and it's not prime.
- Second Iteration (i = 1):
  - The number 8 is not prime.
- Third Iteration (i = 2):
  - The number 1 is not prime.
- Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
  - The number 2 is prime and greater than `maxx` (0), so `maxx` is updated to 2.
- Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
  - The number 1 is not prime.
- Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
  - The number 7 is prime and greater than `maxx` (2), so `maxx` is updated to 7.

After the loop, the function calculates the sum of the digits of `maxx` (7), which is 7.

Therefore, the final output of the function `skjkasdkd([0, 8, 1, 2, 1, 7])` is 7.
