[REASONING]
The function `compare` takes two lists, `game` and `guess`, as input. It returns a new list that contains the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the `game` and `guess` lists. This is achieved by using the `zip` function to pair elements from both lists and then calculating the absolute difference for each pair using a list comprehension.

To determine the output of executing the function `compare` on the input lists `[1,2,3,5]` and `[-1,2,3,4]`, we perform the following steps:
1. Pair the elements from both lists: (1, -1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4).
2. Calculate the absolute differences: |1 - (-1)| = 2, |2 - 2| = 0, |3 - 3| = 0, |5 - 4| = 1.
3. The resulting list of differences is [2, 0, 0, 1].

Therefore, the output of executing the function `compare` on the given input lists is [2, 0, 0, 1].

    # [STATE] game = [1, 2, 3, 5], guess = [-1, 2, 3, 4] [/STATE]
    return [abs(x - y) for x, y in zip(game, guess)]
    # [STATE] zip(game, guess) = [(1, -1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4)] [/STATE]
    # [STATE] abs(x - y) for each pair = [2, 0, 0, 1] [/STATE]
