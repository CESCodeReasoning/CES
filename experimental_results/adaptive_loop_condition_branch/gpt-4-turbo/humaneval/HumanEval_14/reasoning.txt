The function `all_prefixes` is called with the argument (string = 'asdfgh').
Inside the function, an empty list `result` is initialized.
`len(string)` is calculated to be 6, as there are 6 characters in 'asdfgh'.
The loop iterates from 0 to 5, since `range(len(string))` generates numbers from 0 to 5.

First Iteration (i = 0):
    `string[:i+1]` results in 'a'
    'a' is appended to `result`, making it ['a'].
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    `string[:i+1]` results in 'as'
    'as' is appended to `result`, making it ['a', 'as'].
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    `string[:i+1]` results in 'asd'
    'asd' is appended to `result`, making it ['a', 'as', 'asd'].
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    `string[:i+1]` results in 'asdf'
    'asdf' is appended to `result`, making it ['a', 'as', 'asd', 'asdf'].
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    `string[:i+1]` results in 'asdfg'
    'asdfg' is appended to `result`, making it ['a', 'as', 'asd', 'asdf', 'asdfg'].
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    `string[:i+1]` results in 'asdfgh'
    'asdfgh' is appended to `result`, making it ['a', 'as', 'asd', 'asdf', 'asdfg', 'asdfgh'].

After the loop completes, the function returns the `result` list containing all prefixes of the input string.
