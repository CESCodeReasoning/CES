The function `total_match` is called with `lst1 = ['hi', 'admin']` and `lst2 = ['hi', 'hi']`.
Inside the function, two variables `l1` and `l2` are initialized to 0 to store the total lengths of the strings in `lst1` and `lst2` respectively.

For `lst1`:
- First Iteration (st = 'hi'):
    `l1 += len(st)` updates `l1` to 2 (0 + 2 = 2).
- Second Iteration (st = 'admin'):
    `l1 += len(st)` updates `l1` to 7 (2 + 5 = 7).

For `lst2`:
- First Iteration (st = 'hi'):
    `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 2 (0 + 2 = 2).
- Second Iteration (st = 'hi'):
    `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 4 (2 + 2 = 4).

After the loops complete, the condition `(l1 <= l2)` is evaluated. Since `l1 = 7` and `l2 = 4`, the condition is `False`. Therefore, the else branch is taken and the function returns `lst2` as the output.
