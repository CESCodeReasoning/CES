The function `count_distinct_characters` takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string, ignoring case differences. The input string is formed by concatenating 'abcde', 'cade', and 'CADE'.

1. Concatenation of the strings 'abcde', 'cade', and 'CADE' results in 'abcdecadeCADE'.
2. The string is converted to lowercase to ignore case differences, resulting in 'abcdecadecade'.
3. A set is created from the lowercase string, which automatically removes duplicate characters. The set derived from 'abcdecadecade' is {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}.
4. The length of this set is calculated to determine the number of distinct characters. The set contains 5 elements, so the number of distinct characters is 5.

Thus, the output of the function `count_distinct_characters` on the input 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' is 5.
