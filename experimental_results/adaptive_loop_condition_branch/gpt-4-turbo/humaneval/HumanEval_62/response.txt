[REASONING]
The function `derivative` takes a list of coefficients `xs` representing a polynomial and calculates the derivative of the polynomial. The derivative of a polynomial is computed by multiplying each coefficient by its respective index, which represents the power of the variable in the polynomial. The list comprehension in the function iterates over the list `xs` with `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the value `x` at that index. The expression `i * x` computes the derivative term for each coefficient. The result of the list comprehension is then sliced from the first element to the end (excluding the zeroth element) because the derivative of a constant term (the zeroth term) is zero and does not contribute to the derivative polynomial.

For the input `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, the function computes as follows:
- For `i=0`, `x=3`: `0 * 3 = 0` (this term is excluded in the final output)
- For `i=1`, `x=1`: `1 * 1 = 1`
- For `i=2`, `x=2`: `2 * 2 = 4`
- For `i=3`, `x=4`: `3 * 4 = 12`
- For `i=4`, `x=5`: `4 * 5 = 20`

Thus, the output list after excluding the zeroth term is `[1, 4, 12, 20]`.

[ANSWER]
```python
from typing import *
def derivative(xs: list):
    # [STATE] xs = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5] [/STATE]
    return [(i * x) for i, x in enumerate(xs)][1:]  # [STATE] [(i * x) for i, x in enumerate(xs)] = [0, 1, 4, 12, 20] [/STATE]
```
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[1, 4, 12, 20]
