The function `compare_one` is called with `a = 5` and `b = 6`.
- Both `a` and `b` are integers, not strings, so the conditions checking if `temp_a` and `temp_b` are instances of `str` are both false. Therefore, neither `temp_a` nor `temp_b` is modified by replacing commas with dots.
- The comparison `float(temp_a) == float(temp_b)` is evaluated as `float(5) == float(6)`, which is false.
- Since `float(temp_a)` is not greater than `float(temp_b)`, the function returns `b`, which is 6.

Therefore, the final output of the function `compare_one(5, 6)` is 6.
