The function `even_odd_count` is called with the argument `num = -78`.
Inside the function:
- The absolute value of `num` is taken, resulting in `78`.
- This number is then converted to a string, resulting in the string `"78"`.
- The function initializes two counters: `even_count` and `odd_count` both set to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The character '7' is checked.
    - Since `7 % 2 != 0`, it is odd.
    - The `odd_count` is incremented by 1.

Iteration 2:
    - The character '8' is checked.
    - Since `8 % 2 == 0`, it is even.
    - The `even_count` is incremented by 1.

After iterating through all characters in the string, the function returns a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits, which are 1 and 1, respectively.
