The function `fix_spaces` is called with the input string "Example".
The function initializes `new_text` as an empty string, and `i`, `start`, and `end` are all set to 0.
The function then enters a while loop that iterates over each character in the input string based on the condition `i < len(text)`, where `len(text)` is 7 for "Example".

Iteration 1 (i = 0):
- The character at index 0 is 'E', which is not a space.
- Since `end - start` is 0 (no spaces found yet), the character 'E' is directly added to `new_text`.
- `start` and `end` are updated to 1.

Iteration 2 (i = 1):
- The character at index 1 is 'x', which is not a space.
- Since `end - start` is 0, the character 'x' is directly added to `new_text`.
- `start` and `end` are updated to 2.

This process continues for each character in the string "Example", with each character being added directly to `new_text` because there are no spaces in the string.

After the loop, the function checks if there are trailing spaces by evaluating `end - start`. Since there are no trailing spaces, nothing additional is added to `new_text`.

The function returns `new_text`, which is "Example", the same as the input string.
