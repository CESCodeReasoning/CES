[REASONING]
The function `sum_squares` is called with a list of 15 integers.
Inside the function, an empty list `result` is initialized.
The loop iterates over the indices of the list (from 0 to 14).

Iteration 0 (i = 0):
   - `i % 3 == 0` is true, so the square of the element at index 0 (`-16`) is appended to `result`.
Iteration 1 (i = 1):
   - `i % 3 == 0` is false, and `i % 4 == 0` is false, so the element itself (`-9`) is appended.
Iteration 2 (i = 2):
   - Neither condition is met, so the element itself (`-2`) is appended.
Iteration 3 (i = 3):
   - `i % 3 == 0` is true, so the square of the element at index 3 (`36`) is appended.
Iteration 4 (i = 4):
   - `i % 4 == 0` is true, but `i % 3 != 0` is also true, so the cube of the element (`36`) is appended.
Iteration 5 (i = 5):
   - Neither condition is met, so the element itself (`26`) is appended.
Iteration 6 (i = 6):
   - `i % 3 == 0` is true, so the square of the element at index 6 (`-20`) is appended.
Iteration 7 (i = 7):
   - Neither condition is met, so the element itself (`25`) is appended.
Iteration 8 (i = 8):
   - `i % 4 == 0` is true, but `i % 3 != 0` is also true, so the cube of the element (`-40`) is appended.
Iteration 9 (i = 9):
   - `i % 3 == 0` is true, so the square of the element at index 9 (`20`) is appended.
Iteration 10 (i = 10):
   - Neither condition is met, so the element itself (`-4`) is appended.
Iteration 11 (i = 11):
   - Neither condition is met, so the element itself (`12`) is appended.
Iteration 12 (i = 12):
   - `i % 3 == 0` is true, so the square of the element at index 12 (`-26`) is appended.
Iteration 13 (i = 13):
   - Neither condition is met, so the element itself (`35`) is appended.
Iteration 14 (i = 14):
   - `i % 4 == 0` is true, but `i % 3 != 0` is also true, so the cube of the element (`37`) is appended.

Finally, the sum of all elements in the `result` list is calculated and returned.
