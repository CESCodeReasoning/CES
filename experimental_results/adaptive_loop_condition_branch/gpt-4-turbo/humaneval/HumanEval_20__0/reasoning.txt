The function `find_closest_elements(numbers)` takes a list of floating-point numbers `[1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1]` as its parameter.
The goal is to find the pair of elements with the smallest absolute difference between them.

The function uses two nested loops to compare each element with every other element in the list:
- The outer loop iterates over each element `elem` of the list, with its index `idx`.
- The inner loop iterates over each element `elem2` of the list again, with its index `idx2`.

For each pair `(elem, elem2)` where `idx` is not equal to `idx2`:
- If `distance` is `None` (which is true for the first valid comparison), it sets `distance` to the absolute difference between `elem` and `elem2` and stores the sorted tuple `(elem, elem2)` as `closest_pair`.
- For subsequent comparisons, it calculates a new distance `new_distance` between `elem` and `elem2`. If `new_distance` is less than the current `distance`, it updates `distance` and `closest_pair` with the new values.

The function returns the `closest_pair` after all comparisons are made.

Step-by-step:
- First valid comparison is between 1.1 and 2.2, distance is 1.1, closest_pair is (1.1, 2.2).
- Next comparisons update the closest_pair only if a smaller distance is found:
  - Comparing 1.1 with 3.1, 4.1, 5.1 does not yield a smaller distance.
  - Comparing 2.2 with 3.1 gives a distance of 0.9, updating closest_pair to (2.2, 3.1).
  - Further comparisons do not find a smaller distance than 0.9.

The closest pair of elements with the smallest distance is (2.2, 3.1).
