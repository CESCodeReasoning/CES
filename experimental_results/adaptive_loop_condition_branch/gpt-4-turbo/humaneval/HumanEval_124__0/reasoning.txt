The function `valid_date` is called with the string '01-01-2007'.
1. The string is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, though in this case, there are none.
2. The date string is split into three parts: '01' for month, '01' for day, and '2007' for year.
3. These string values are converted to integers: month = 1, day = 1, year = 2007.
4. The function then checks if the month is valid (1 <= month <= 12). Since month = 1, this condition is false for both `month < 1` and `month > 12`.
5. Next, it checks if the day is valid for months with 31 days (January is one of these months). Since day = 1, the conditions `day < 1` and `day > 31` are both false.
6. The function does not check the conditions for months with 30 days or February since the month is January.
7. No exceptions are raised during the execution.
8. Since all conditions for an invalid date are false, the function returns True, indicating that '01-01-2007' is a valid date.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('01-01-2007')` is True.
