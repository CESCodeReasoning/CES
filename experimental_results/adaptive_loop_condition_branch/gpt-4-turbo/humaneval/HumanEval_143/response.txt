[REASONING]
The function `words_in_sentence(sentence)` takes a string `sentence` and processes it to filter out certain words based on specific conditions:
1. The function splits the sentence into words.
2. It iterates over each word:
   - If the word has a length of 1, it sets a flag `flg` to 1.
   - For words longer than 1 character, it checks if the length of the word is divisible by any number from 2 up to the length of the word minus one. If it is divisible, it sets the flag `flg` to 1.
   - Finally, if the flag `flg` is still 0 or the word has a length of 2, the word is added to the result list `new_lst`.
3. The function returns the words in `new_lst` joined as a single string.

For the input "This is a test":
- "This" has a length of 4. It checks divisibility for 2 and 3. Since 4 is divisible by 2, `flg` is set to 1.
- "is" has a length of 2. It doesn't check divisibility because there's no number between 2 and 1 (exclusive). It is added to `new_lst` because its length is 2.
- "a" has a length of 1. `flg` is set to 1 immediately.
- "test" has a length of 4. It checks divisibility for 2 and 3. Since 4 is divisible by 2, `flg` is set to 1.

The final output is "is" because it's the only word that meets the condition of having a length of 2 or not being divisible by any number from 2 to its length minus one.
