[REASONING]
The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a string `txt` as input and checks if the last character of the last word in the string is a single letter from the English alphabet. The function performs the following steps:
1. It splits the input string `txt` by spaces using `txt.split(' ')` to get a list of words.
2. It then selects the last word from this list using `[-1]`. In the case of the input "apple pi e ", the last word is an empty string because there is a space after the last 'e'.
3. The function checks if the length of this last word is 1 and if its ASCII value (converted to lowercase) is between 97 ('a') and 122 ('z'). This is done using the condition `len(check) == 1 and (97 <= ord(check.lower()) <= 122)`.
4. If both conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

For the input "apple pi e ", the last word is an empty string due to the trailing space. The length of this string is not 1, so the condition `len(check) == 1` is False. Therefore, the function will return `False`.

[ANSWER]
```python
from typing import *

def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt: str) -> bool:
    # [STATE] txt = "apple pi e " [/STATE]
    check = txt.split(' ')[-1]  # [STATE] check = "" [/STATE]
    # [CONDITION] len(check) == 1 and (97 <= ord(check.lower()) <= 122) [/CONDITION]
    # [BRANCH] N [/BRANCH]
    return True if len(check) == 1 and (
        97 <= ord(check.lower()) <= 122) else False
```
