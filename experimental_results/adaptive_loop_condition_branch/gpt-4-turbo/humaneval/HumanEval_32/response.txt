[REASONING]
The function `find_zero` is designed to find a root of a polynomial within the interval [-1, 1] initially, and it expands the search space if no sign change is detected in the polynomial values at the endpoints of the interval. The polynomial is defined by the coefficients in the list `xs` and evaluated at a point `x` using the `poly` function.

The polynomial represented by `xs = [-6, 11, -6, 1]` corresponds to the equation \(1x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6\).

1. **Initial Interval**: The initial interval is set from -1 to 1. The polynomial values at these points are calculated:
   - `poly([-6, 11, -6, 1], -1) = 1*(-1)^3 - 6*(-1)^2 + 11*(-1) - 6 = -1 - 6 - 11 - 6 = -24`
   - `poly([-6, 11, -6, 1], 1) = 1*1^3 - 6*1^2 + 11*1 - 6 = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0`
   - Since the product of these values is not greater than 0, the interval is not expanded.

2. **Binary Search for Zero**:
   - The interval is now [-1, 1] with a difference of 2.0.
   - The midpoint `center` is calculated as 0.0.
   - The polynomial value at the center is `poly([-6, 11, -6, 1], 0.0) = 0`.
   - Since the product of `poly([-6, 11, -6, 1], 0.0)` and `poly([-6, 11, -6, 1], -1)` is 0, the end of the interval is updated to 0.0.
   - The interval is now [-1, 0] with a difference of 1.0.
   - This process continues, halving the interval until the difference between `begin` and `end` is less than `1e-10`.

3. **Convergence**:
   - The method converges when the interval is sufficiently small, and the function returns the `begin` value, which is approximately the root of the polynomial.

The root found is approximately 0.9999999997671694, which is very close to 1, a root of the polynomial.
