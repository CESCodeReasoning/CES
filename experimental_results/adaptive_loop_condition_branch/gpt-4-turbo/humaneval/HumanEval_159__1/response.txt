[REASONING]
The function `eat` is called with the arguments `number = 2`, `need = 11`, and `remaining = 5`.
The function checks if the `need` (11) is less than or equal to `remaining` (5).
- The condition `(need <= remaining)` evaluates to `False` because 11 is greater than 5.
Since the condition is `False`, the `else` branch is taken.
- In the `else` branch, the function calculates `number + remaining` which is `2 + 5 = 7` and sets the remaining to `0`.
Thus, the function returns the list `[7, 0]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `eat(2, 11, 5)` is `[7, 0]`.

[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def eat(number, need, remaining):
    if (need <= remaining): ## [CONDITION](need <= remaining)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
        return [number + need, remaining - need]
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=[Y][/BRANCH]
        return [number + remaining, 0]

[7, 0]
