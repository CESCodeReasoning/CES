The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with the input string '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'.
The function is designed to separate groups of balanced parentheses into individual strings.

1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the final groups of balanced parentheses.
2. Initialize an empty list `current_string` to build the current group of balanced parentheses.
3. Initialize `current_depth` to 0 to keep track of the depth of nested parentheses.

The function iterates over each character `c` in the input string:
- If `c` is '(', it indicates the start of a new group or a deeper level in the current group:
  - Increment `current_depth` by 1.
  - Append `c` to `current_string`.
- If `c` is ')', it indicates the end of a current group or moving back from a deeper level:
  - Decrement `current_depth` by 1.
  - Append `c` to `current_string`.
  - If `current_depth` becomes 0, it means a complete group of balanced parentheses has been formed:
    - Append the joined `current_string` to `result`.
    - Clear `current_string` to start a new group.

The loop processes each character, building groups of balanced parentheses and adding them to `result` when a group is completed.

Finally, the function returns the `result` list containing all separate groups of balanced parentheses.

The expected output for the input '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())' is a list of strings: ['(()())', '((()))', '()', '((())()())'].
