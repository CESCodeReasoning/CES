The function `any_int` is called with the arguments (x = 2, y = 3, z = 1).
First, the function checks if all the arguments x, y, and z are integers using `isinstance`. Since all are integers, the first condition is true, and the branch is taken.
Next, the function checks if any pair of these integers sums up to the third integer:
   - x + y = 2 + 3 = 5, which is not equal to z (1).
   - x + z = 2 + 1 = 3, which is not equal to y (3).
   - y + z = 3 + 1 = 4, which is not equal to x (2).
Since none of these conditions are met, the second condition is false, and the branch is not taken.
The function then returns False because no pair of numbers sums up to the third.

Therefore, the final output of the function `any_int(2, 3, 1)` is False.
