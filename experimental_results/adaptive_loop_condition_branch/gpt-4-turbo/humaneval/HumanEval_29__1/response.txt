[REASONING]
The function `filter_by_prefix` takes two parameters: a list of strings `strings` and a string `prefix`. It returns a new list containing only those strings from the input list that start with the specified prefix.
To determine the output of executing the function `filter_by_prefix` on the input list `['a', 'ab', 'abc', 'ba', 'bb', 'bc']` with the prefix `'a'`, we need to check each string in the list to see if it starts with the prefix `'a'`.
- The string 'a' starts with 'a', so it is included in the result.
- The string 'ab' starts with 'a', so it is also included.
- The string 'abc' starts with 'a', so it is included as well.
- The string 'ba' does not start with 'a', so it is not included.
- The string 'bb' does not start with 'a', so it is not included.
- The string 'bc' does not start with 'a', so it is not included.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `filter_by_prefix` on the given input is `['a', 'ab', 'abc']`.

[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    # [STATE] strings = ['a', 'ab', 'abc', 'ba', 'bb', 'bc'], prefix = 'a' [/STATE]
    return [x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]  # [CONDITION] x.startswith(prefix) [/CONDITION]
[/PYTHON]

[OUTPUT]
['a', 'ab', 'abc']
