[REASONING]
The function `sort_even` is called with the list `[1, 2, 3]`.
Inside the function:
1. `evens` is assigned the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list, which results in `[1, 3]`.
2. `odds` is assigned the elements at odd indices of the list, which results in `[2]`.
3. Both `evens` and `odds` are sorted. Since `evens` contains `[1, 3]`, it remains `[1, 3]` after sorting. `odds` contains `[2]`, which remains `[2]` after sorting.
4. An empty list `ans` is initialized.
5. A loop iterates over the zipped lists `evens` and `odds`. The zip operation pairs elements from `evens` and `odds` together, resulting in one pair: `(1, 2)`.
   - In the first iteration, `e` is `1` and `o` is `2`. These values are extended into the `ans` list, making `ans` now `[1, 2]`.
6. After the loop, the function checks if the length of `evens` is greater than the length of `odds`. In this case, `len(evens) = 2` and `len(odds) = 1`, so the condition is true.
   - Since the condition is true, the last element of `evens` (`3`) is appended to `ans`, making `ans` now `[1, 2, 3]`.
7. The function returns the list `ans`.

The output of the function is the tuple `(1, 2, 3)`.
