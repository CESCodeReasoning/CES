The function `solve` takes an integer `N` as input. The steps executed in the function are as follows:
1. Convert the integer `N` to a string to iterate over each digit.
2. Use a generator expression inside the `sum` function to convert each character (digit) back to an integer and sum them up.
3. Convert the resulting sum to its binary representation using the `bin` function, which returns a string prefixed with '0b'.
4. Slice the binary string to remove the '0b' prefix and return the result.

For the input `963`:
- Convert `963` to the string `"963"`.
- Convert each character to an integer and sum them: `9 + 6 + 3 = 18`.
- Convert `18` to binary: `bin(18)` results in `'0b10010'`.
- Slice off the '0b' prefix: `'10010'`.

Thus, the output for the input `963` is `'10010'`.
