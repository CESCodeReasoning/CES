[REASONING]
The function `count_distinct_characters` takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string, ignoring case differences. Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the input 'abcde':
1. The input string 'abcde' is converted to lowercase, which remains 'abcde' since all characters are already in lowercase.
2. A set is created from the lowercase string. Sets automatically remove any duplicate elements, so the set created from 'abcde' contains the characters {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}.
3. The length of this set is calculated. Since there are five unique characters, the length is 5.
4. The function returns the integer 5, representing the number of distinct characters in the input string.

[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    # [STATE] string.lower() is 'abcde' [/STATE]
    # [STATE] set(string.lower()) is {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'} [/STATE]
    # [STATE] len(set(string.lower())) is 5 [/STATE]
    return len(set(string.lower()))
