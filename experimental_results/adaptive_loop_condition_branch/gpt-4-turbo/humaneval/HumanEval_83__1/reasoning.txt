The function `starts_one_ends` is called with ( n = 2 ).
The function first checks if `n` is equal to 1. Since `n` is 2, the condition `(n == 1)` evaluates to False, and the corresponding branch is not taken.
Since the condition is not met, the function proceeds to the return statement outside the if block. The expression `18 * (10 ** (n - 2))` is evaluated:
   - `n - 2` calculates to `0`.
   - `10 ** 0` equals `1`.
   - `18 * 1` equals `18`.
Thus, the function returns `18`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `starts_one_ends(2)` is 18.
