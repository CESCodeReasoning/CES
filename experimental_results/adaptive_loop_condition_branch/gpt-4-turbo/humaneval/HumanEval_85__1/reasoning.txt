The function `add` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of elements that are at odd indices (1-based) and are even numbers. The function uses list comprehension to filter and sum the elements based on these conditions.

For the input list `[4, 4, 6, 8]`:
- The list comprehension iterates over the indices 1, 3 (since the step is 2, starting from index 1).
- At index 1, the element is 4, which is even, so it is included in the sum.
- At index 3, the element is 8, which is also even, so it is included in the sum.
- The sum of the elements at these indices is 4 + 8 = 12.

Thus, the output of the function `add` on the input `[4, 4, 6, 8]` is 12.
