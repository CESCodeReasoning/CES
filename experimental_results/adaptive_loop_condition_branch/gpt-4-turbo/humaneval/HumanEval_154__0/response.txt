[REASONING]
The function `cycpattern_check(a, b)` is designed to check if the string `b` is a cyclic permutation of any substring of `a` of length equal to `b`. The function takes two strings `a` and `b` as input.

1. Calculate the length of `b` and store it in variable `l`.
2. Create a new string `pat` which is `b` concatenated with itself. This helps in checking cyclic permutations easily.
3. The outer loop iterates over `a` with the range from 0 to `len(a) - l + 1`. This ensures that we only consider substrings of `a` that are of length `l`.
4. The inner loop iterates over `pat` with the range from 0 to `l + 1`. This is to check every possible cyclic permutation of `b` against the substrings of `a`.
5. In each iteration of the inner loop, a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and of length `l` is compared with a substring of `pat` starting from index `j` and of length `l`.
6. If any of these comparisons return true, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that a cyclic permutation of `b` is found in `a`.
7. If no match is found after all iterations, the function returns `False`.

For the input `a = "winemtt"` and `b = "tinem"`, the steps are as follows:
- `l` is calculated as 5.
- `pat` becomes "tinemtinem".
- The outer loop runs from 0 to 3 (`len(a) - l + 1 = 8 - 5 + 1 = 4`).
- The inner loop runs from 0 to 6 (`l + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6`).
- Various comparisons are made between substrings of `a` and `pat`.
- The substring "tinem" from `a` (from index 2 to 6) matches with the substring "tinem" from `pat` (from index 0 to 5), so the function returns `True`.
