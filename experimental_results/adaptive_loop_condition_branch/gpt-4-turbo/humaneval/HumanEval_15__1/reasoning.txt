The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string that contains a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.
To determine the output of executing the function `string_sequence` on the input `10`, we need to generate a list of numbers from 0 to 10. This list is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
Next, we convert each number in the list to a string and join them with spaces to form the final string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `string_sequence` on the input `10` is "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10".
