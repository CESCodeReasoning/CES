[REASONING]
The function `fib` is called with `n = 10`. This function calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

1. The function first checks if `n == 0`. Since `n` is 10, this condition is false.
2. Next, it checks if `n == 1`. Since `n` is 10, this condition is also false.
3. Since neither of the base cases are met (`n == 0` or `n == 1`), the function proceeds to the recursive case: `fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)`.
4. This results in two recursive calls: `fib(9)` and `fib(8)`.
5. Each of these calls further breaks down into more recursive calls until the base cases (`n == 0` or `n == 1`) are reached.
6. The results of these base cases are then combined step by step (using addition) to produce the final result for `fib(10)`.

The recursive breakdown continues until all values are computed and added up to give the 10th Fibonacci number, which is 55.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fib(10)` is 55.
