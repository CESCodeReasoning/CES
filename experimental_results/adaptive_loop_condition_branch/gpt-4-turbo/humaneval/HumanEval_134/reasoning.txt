The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a string `txt` as input. The function first splits the string into a list of words using the space character as a delimiter. It then selects the last word from this list. The function checks if the last word consists of exactly one character and if that character is a letter (from 'a' to 'z' or 'A' to 'Z'). This is done by checking if the ASCII value of the character (converted to lowercase) is between 97 ('a') and 122 ('z'). If both conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

For the input "apple", the steps are as follows:
1. The string "apple" is split into a list containing a single element: ["apple"].
2. The last element of this list, "apple", is selected.
3. The function checks if "apple" has exactly one character and if it is a letter. Since "apple" has more than one character, the function returns `False`.

Thus, the output for the input "apple" is `False`.
