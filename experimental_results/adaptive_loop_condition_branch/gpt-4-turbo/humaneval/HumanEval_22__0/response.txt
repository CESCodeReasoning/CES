[REASONING]
The function `filter_integers` is designed to take a list of any type of values and return a new list containing only the integers from the input list. The function uses list comprehension to iterate over each element `x` in the input list `values`. For each element, it checks if `x` is an instance of `int` using the `isinstance` function. If `x` is an integer, it is included in the new list; otherwise, it is excluded.

In this specific case, the input to the function is an empty list `[]`. Since there are no elements in the list, the list comprehension does not iterate over any elements, and thus no checks are performed. Consequently, the output will also be an empty list `[]`, as there were no integers to filter.

[ANSWER]
```python
from typing import *

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    # [STATE] values = [] [/STATE]
    return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]  # [CONDITION] isinstance(x, int) [/CONDITION] [BRANCH] N [/BRANCH]
```
