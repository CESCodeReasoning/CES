The function `max_element` is called with the list `[3, 2, -3.5, 0]`.
Inside the function, a variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list, which is `3`.

Iteration 1:
    - The element `3` is compared with `m` (which is also `3`). The condition `(e > m)` is false.
    - No change in `m`.

Iteration 2:
    - The element `2` is compared with `m` (`3`). The condition `(e > m)` is false.
    - No change in `m`.

Iteration 3:
    - The element `-3.5` is compared with `m` (`3`). The condition `(e > m)` is false.
    - No change in `m`.

Iteration 4:
    - The element `0` is compared with `m` (`3`). The condition `(e > m)` is false.
    - No change in `m`.

After iterating through all elements, the maximum value found is `3`, which is the initial value of `m`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `max_element([3, 2, -3.5, 0])` is `3`.
