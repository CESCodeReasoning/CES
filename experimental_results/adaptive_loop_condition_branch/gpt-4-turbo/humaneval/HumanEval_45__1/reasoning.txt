The function `triangle_area` takes two parameters, `a` and `h`, which represent the base and height of a triangle, respectively. The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]
Given the inputs `a = 2` and `h = 2`, the area calculation would be:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 = 2.0 \]
Thus, the output of executing the function `triangle_area` with the inputs `2` and `2` is `2.0`.
