[REASONING]
The function `iscube` checks whether a given number `a` is a perfect cube. The steps involved in the function are as follows:
1. The absolute value of `a` is taken to handle negative numbers, since the cube root of a negative number can also be a perfect cube (e.g., -8 is -2 cubed).
2. The cube root of the absolute value of `a` is computed using `a ** (1. / 3)`. This expression calculates the cube root.
3. The result of the cube root is then rounded to the nearest integer using `round()`, to handle any floating-point arithmetic issues.
4. This rounded integer is then cubed (raised to the power of 3) using `** 3` to check if it equals the original number `a`.
5. The function returns `True` if the cubed value of the rounded integer equals the original number `a`, indicating that `a` is a perfect cube. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

For the input `iscube(1)`:
- The absolute value of 1 is 1.
- The cube root of 1 is 1.0, which rounds to 1.
- Raising 1 to the third power gives 1.
- Since 1 equals the original number 1, the function returns `True`.

Thus, the output for `iscube(1)` is `True`.

```python
from typing import *
def iscube(a):
    a = abs(a)  # [STATE] a = 1 [/STATE]
    return int(round(a ** (1. / 3))) ** 3 == a  # [CONDITION] int(round(a ** (1. / 3))) ** 3 == a [/CONDITION] [BRANCH] Y [/BRANCH]
```
