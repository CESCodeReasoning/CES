[REASONING]
The function `triples_sum_to_zero(l)` takes a list `l` of integers ([1, 3, 5, 0]) and checks if any three distinct elements in the list sum to zero. The function uses three nested loops to generate all possible combinations of three different elements from the list.

First Iteration (i=0):
- `i` is 0, `l[i]` is 1. The second loop (`j`) starts from 1.
    - Second Iteration (j=1):
        - `j` is 1, `l[j]` is 3. The third loop (`k`) starts from 2.
            - Third Iteration (k=2):
                - `k` is 2, `l[k]` is 5. The sum `l[i] + l[j] + l[k]` is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is not zero.
            - Third Iteration (k=3):
                - `k` is 3, `l[k]` is 0. The sum `l[i] + l[j] + l[k]` is 1 + 3 + 0 = 4, which is not zero.
    - Second Iteration (j=2):
        - `j` is 2, `l[j]` is 5. The third loop (`k`) starts from 3.
            - Third Iteration (k=3):
                - `k` is 3, `l[k]` is 0. The sum `l[i] + l[j] + l[k]` is 1 + 5 + 0 = 6, which is not zero.
- First Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, `l[i]` is 3. The second loop (`j`) starts from 2.
        - Second Iteration (j=2):
            - `j` is 2, `l[j]` is 5. The third loop (`k`) starts from 3.
                - Third Iteration (k=3):
                    - `k` is 3, `l[k]` is 0. The sum `l[i] + l[j] + l[k]` is 3 + 5 + 0 = 8, which is not zero.
- First Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, `l[i]` is 5. The second loop (`j`) starts from 3.
        - Second Iteration (j=3):
            - `j` is 3, `l[j]` is 0. The third loop (`k`) does not start as there are no more elements.
- First Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, `l[i]` is 0. The second loop (`j`) does not start as there are no more elements.

No combination of three elements sums to zero, so the function returns False.
