The function `encrypt` is called with the string 'asdfghjkl'.
Inside the function, a string `d` containing the alphabet is defined, and an empty string `out` is initialized to store the result.
The function iterates over each character `c` in the input string `s`.

Iteration 1:
    - The character 'a' is in `d`, so it is shifted by 4 positions (2 * 2) in the alphabet, resulting in 'e'.
Iteration 2:
    - The character 's' is in `d`, so it is shifted by 4 positions, resulting in 'w'.
Iteration 3:
    - The character 'd' is in `d`, so it is shifted by 4 positions, resulting in 'h'.
Iteration 4:
    - The character 'f' is in `d`, so it is shifted by 4 positions, resulting in 'j'.
Iteration 5:
    - The character 'g' is in `d`, so it is shifted by 4 positions, resulting in 'k'.
Iteration 6:
    - The character 'h' is in `d`, so it is shifted by 4 positions, resulting in 'l'.
Iteration 7:
    - The character 'j' is in `d`, so it is shifted by 4 positions, resulting in 'n'.
Iteration 8:
    - The character 'k' is in `d`, so it is shifted by 4 positions, resulting in 'o'.
Iteration 9:
    - The character 'l' is in `d`, so it is shifted by 4 positions, resulting in 'p'.

After processing all characters, the encrypted string 'ewhjknlop' is returned.
