[REASONING]
The function `is_happy` is called with the string `s = "a"`.
Inside the function, the first condition checks if the length of the string `s` is less than 3.
Since the length of "a" is 1, which is indeed less than 3, the condition `(len(s) < 3)` evaluates to True.
As a result, the function immediately returns `False` without entering the loop, because the string does not meet the minimum length requirement to check for consecutive similar characters.

[ANSWER]
[PYTHON]
from typing import *
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3: ## [CONDITION](len(s) < 3)=True[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=Y[/BRANCH]
      return False

    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
      
      if s[i] == s[i+1] or s[i+1] == s[i+2] or s[i] == s[i+2]:
        return False
    return True
