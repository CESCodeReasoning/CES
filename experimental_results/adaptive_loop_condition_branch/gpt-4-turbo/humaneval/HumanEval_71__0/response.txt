[REASONING]
The function `triangle_area` is called with the sides of a triangle: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3.
The function first checks if the given sides can form a triangle using the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.

For the given sides:
- a + b = 1 + 2 = 3
- a + c = 1 + 3 = 4
- b + c = 2 + 3 = 5

The condition checks:
- a + b <= c (3 <= 3) is True
- a + c <= b (4 <= 2) is False
- b + c <= a (5 <= 1) is False

Since one of the conditions (a + b <= c) is True, the function concludes that these sides cannot form a triangle and returns -1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `triangle_area(1, 2, 3)` is -1.
