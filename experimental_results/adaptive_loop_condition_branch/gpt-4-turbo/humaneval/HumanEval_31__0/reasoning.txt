The function `is_prime` is called with the argument `n = 5 * 17` which evaluates to `85`.
1. The function first checks if `n` is less than 2. Since `85` is greater than `2`, this condition is false.
2. The function then enters a loop that iterates from `2` to `n - 1` (which is `84` in this case).
3. During the iterations:
   - When `k = 5`, the condition `n % k == 0` is true because `85 % 5 = 0`. This indicates that `85` is divisible by `5`, proving that `85` is not a prime number.
   - The function returns `False` immediately after finding this divisor without completing the rest of the loop.
4. Therefore, the output of the function `is_prime(85)` is `False`.
