[REASONING]
The function `is_happy` is called with the string "aabb".
1. The function first checks if the length of the string `s` is less than 3. Since "aabb" has a length of 4, this condition is false.
2. The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to `len(s) - 2`, which calculates to 2 (4 - 2 = 2). Thus, the loop will iterate over the indices 0 and 1.
3. In the first iteration (i = 0):
   - The characters compared are `s[0]`, `s[1]`, and `s[2]` which are 'a', 'a', and 'b' respectively.
   - The condition checks if any of these characters are equal. Since `s[0]` is equal to `s[1]`, the condition is true.
   - The function returns False because it found two adjacent characters that are the same.
4. The loop does not proceed to the second iteration because the function has already returned False.

Therefore, the function `is_happy("aabb")` returns False because it found a repetition of characters.
