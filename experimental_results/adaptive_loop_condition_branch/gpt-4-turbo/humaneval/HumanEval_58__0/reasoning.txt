The function `common(l1, l2)` takes two lists `l1` and `l2` as parameters. The function aims to find common elements between these two lists and return them in sorted order.

The function initializes an empty set `ret` to store unique common elements found during the iteration.

The outer loop iterates through each element `e1` in list `l1`. For each `e1`, the inner loop iterates through each element `e2` in list `l2`.

During each iteration of the inner loop, the function checks if `e1` is equal to `e2`. If they are equal, it means that the element is common to both lists, and it is added to the set `ret`.

Here's the detailed iteration:
- For `e1=4` from `l1`, it compares with `3`, `2`, and `4` from `l2`. It finds a match with `4`.
- For `e1=3` from `l1`, it compares with `3`, `2`, and `4` from `l2`. It finds a match with `3`.
- For `e1=2` from `l1`, it compares with `3`, `2`, and `4` from `l2`. It finds a match with `2`.
- For `e1=8` from `l1`, it compares with `3`, `2`, and `4` from `l2`. No match is found.

After all iterations, the set `ret` contains `{2, 3, 4}`. The function then converts this set to a list, sorts it, and returns the sorted list `[2, 3, 4]`.
