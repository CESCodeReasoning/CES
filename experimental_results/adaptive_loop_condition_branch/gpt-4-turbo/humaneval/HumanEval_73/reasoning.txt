The function `smallest_change` is called with the array `[1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]`.
The function aims to find the minimum number of changes required to make the array a palindrome by comparing elements from the start and the end of the array moving towards the center.

1. The length of the array is 8, so the loop will iterate from 0 to `len(arr) // 2 - 1` which is 3 (i.e., 0 to 3).
2. The loop checks if the element at the beginning of the array (`arr[i]`) is different from the element at the mirrored position from the end (`arr[len(arr) - i - 1]`).

Iteration 1 (i = 0):
   - Compare `arr[0]` (1) with `arr[7]` (6). They are different.
   - Increment `ans` by 1 (ans = 1).

Iteration 2 (i = 1):
   - Compare `arr[1]` (2) with `arr[6]` (9). They are different.
   - Increment `ans` by 1 (ans = 2).

Iteration 3 (i = 2):
   - Compare `arr[2]` (3) with `arr[5]` (7). They are different.
   - Increment `ans` by 1 (ans = 3).

Iteration 4 (i = 3):
   - Compare `arr[3]` (5) with `arr[4]` (4). They are different.
   - Increment `ans` by 1 (ans = 4).

After the loop, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is 4. This indicates that 4 changes are needed to make the array a palindrome.
