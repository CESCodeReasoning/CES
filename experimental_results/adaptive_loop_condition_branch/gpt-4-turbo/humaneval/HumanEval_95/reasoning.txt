The function `check_dict_case` is called with a dictionary `{"p":"pineapple", "b":"banana"}`.
1. The function first checks if the dictionary is empty. Since it's not, the `else` branch is taken.
2. The variable `state` is initialized to "start".
3. The function then iterates over the keys of the dictionary.
   - First Iteration (key = 'p'):
     - The key 'p' is a string, so the condition `isinstance(key, str) == False` is false.
     - Since `state` is "start", it checks if 'p' is uppercase or lowercase. 'p' is lowercase, so `state` is set to "lower".
   - Second Iteration (key = 'b'):
     - The key 'b' is a string, so the condition `isinstance(key, str) == False` is false.
     - Since `state` is "lower", it checks if 'b' is lowercase. 'b' is lowercase, so `state` remains "lower".
4. After the loop, the function checks if `state` is either "upper" or "lower". Since `state` is "lower", the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the function `check_dict_case({"p":"pineapple", "b":"banana"})` returns `True`.
