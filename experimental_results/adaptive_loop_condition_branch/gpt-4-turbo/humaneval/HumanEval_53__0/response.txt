[REASONING]
The function `add` takes two integers, `x` and `y`, as input and returns their sum.
To determine the output of executing the function `add` on the inputs `7` and `5`, we need to compute the sum of `7` and `5`.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `add` on the inputs `7` and `5` is `12`.
[REASONING]

[ANSWER]
```python
from typing import *

def add(x: int, y: int):  # [STATE] x=7, y=5 [/STATE]
    return x + y  # [STATE] return value of x+y is 12 [/STATE]
```
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
12
