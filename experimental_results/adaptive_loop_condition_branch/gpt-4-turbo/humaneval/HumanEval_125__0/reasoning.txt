The function `split_words` is called with an empty string (`txt = ""`).
1. The first condition checks if there is a space `" "` in the text. Since the text is empty, this condition is false.
2. The second condition checks if there is a comma `","` in the text. Again, since the text is empty, this condition is also false.
3. Neither of the first two conditions are met, so the function proceeds to the `else` block.
4. In the `else` block, a list comprehension is used to find all lowercase letters in the text that have an even ASCII value. Since the text is empty, the list comprehension returns an empty list.
5. The length of this empty list is calculated, which is 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `split_words("")` is 0.
