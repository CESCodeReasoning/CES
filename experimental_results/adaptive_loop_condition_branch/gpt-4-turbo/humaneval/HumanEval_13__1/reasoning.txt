The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with the arguments (a = 144) and (b = 60).
The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The algorithm repeatedly replaces the larger number by its remainder when divided by the smaller number until the smaller number becomes zero.

First Iteration:
- Initial values: a = 144, b = 60
- The operation `a % b` calculates the remainder of 144 divided by 60, which is 24.
- The values are updated: a becomes 60, b becomes 24.

Second Iteration:
- Current values: a = 60, b = 24
- The operation `a % b` calculates the remainder of 60 divided by 24, which is 12.
- The values are updated: a becomes 24, b becomes 12.

Third Iteration:
- Current values: a = 24, b = 12
- The operation `a % b` calculates the remainder of 24 divided by 12, which is 0.
- The values are updated: a becomes 12, b becomes 0.

At this point, since b is 0, the while loop terminates. The function returns the current value of a, which is 12, the greatest common divisor of 144 and 60.
