[REASONING]
The function `fib4` is designed to compute a sequence where each term is the sum of the previous four terms, starting with the initial list [0, 0, 2, 0]. The function takes an integer `n` and returns the nth term of this sequence.

1. The function is called with `n = 5`.
2. The initial list `results` is set to [0, 0, 2, 0].
3. The function first checks if `n` is less than 4. Since `n = 5`, this condition is false, so the branch is not taken.
4. The loop starts from 4 up to `n + 1` (which is 6 in this case). The loop will iterate twice (for values 4 and 5).
5. In each iteration, a new element is appended to `results`. This new element is the sum of the last four elements of `results`.
   - First Iteration (i = 4):
     - New element = 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 2
     - `results` becomes [0, 2, 0, 2]
     - The first element (0) is popped, resulting in [2, 0, 2]
   - Second Iteration (i = 5):
     - New element = 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 4
     - `results` becomes [0, 2, 2, 4]
     - The first element (2) is popped, resulting in [2, 2, 4]
6. After the loop, the function returns the last element of `results`, which is 4.

Thus, the output of the function call `fib4(5)` is 4.
