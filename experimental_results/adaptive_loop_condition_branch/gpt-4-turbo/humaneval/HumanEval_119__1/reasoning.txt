The function `match_parens` is called with the list `['(()(())', '())())']`.
The function defines a nested function `check(s)` that verifies if the parentheses in the string `s` are balanced. It initializes `val` to 0 and iterates through each character in the string. If the character is '(', `val` is incremented by 1; if it's ')', `val` is decremented by 1. If `val` becomes negative at any point, it returns `False` indicating unbalanced parentheses. After the loop, it checks if `val` equals 0 to ensure all open parentheses are closed.

Two strings `S1` and `S2` are formed by concatenating the elements of the list in different orders:
- `S1` = '(()(())' + '())())' = '(()(())())())'
- `S2` = '())())' + '(()(())' = '())())(()(()'

The `check` function is called for both `S1` and `S2`:
- For `S1`, the parentheses are not balanced as there are more closing parentheses than opening ones.
- For `S2`, the parentheses are also not balanced as there are unmatched closing parentheses before enough opening ones.

Since neither `S1` nor `S2` are balanced, the function returns 'No'.
