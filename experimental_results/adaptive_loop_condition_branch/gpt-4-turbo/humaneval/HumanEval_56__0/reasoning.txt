The function `correct_bracketing` is called with the string `"<><><<><>><>>><>"`.
The function checks if the brackets are correctly nested using a depth counter:
- `depth` is initialized to 0.
- For each character `b` in the string:
  - If `b` is '<', `depth` is incremented by 1.
  - If `b` is '>', `depth` is decremented by 1.
  - If at any point `depth` becomes negative, it means there's a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket, and the function returns `False`.
- After the loop, if `depth` is not zero, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function should return `False`. If `depth` is zero, it means all brackets are correctly nested, and the function returns `True`.

Step-by-step:
- `<` increments depth to 1.
- `>` decrements depth to 0.
- `<` increments depth to 1.
- `>` decrements depth to 0.
- `<` increments depth to 1.
- `<` increments depth to 2.
- `>` decrements depth to 1.
- `<` increments depth to 2.
- `>` decrements depth to 1.
- `>` decrements depth to 0.
- `<` increments depth to 1.
- `>` decrements depth to 0.
- `>` decrements depth to -1 (incorrect, returns False immediately).

The function returns `False` as soon as the depth goes negative, indicating incorrect bracketing.
