The function `remove_duplicates` is designed to remove all elements from the input list `numbers` that appear more than once. The function uses the `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the list. 
1. The input list is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]`.
2. The `Counter` object `c` will count the occurrences of each number, resulting in `Counter({2: 2, 3: 2, 1: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1})`.
3. The list comprehension `[n for n in numbers if c[n] <= 1]` iterates over the original list and includes only those numbers `n` for which the count `c[n]` is less than or equal to 1.
4. The numbers 2 and 3 appear more than once, so they are excluded from the result.
5. The final list, containing numbers that appear only once, is `[1, 4, 5]`.
