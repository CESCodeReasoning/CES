The function `digits` is called with the argument `n = 5`.
Inside the function:
- A variable `product` is initialized to 1.
- A variable `odd_count` is initialized to 0.
- The number `n` is converted to a string to iterate over its digits.

Iteration over the digits of `n` (which is '5' in this case):
- The digit '5' is converted to an integer (`int_digit = 5`).
- The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` checks if the digit is odd.
  - Since 5 is odd (`5 % 2 == 1`), the condition is true.
  - The `product` is updated by multiplying it with `int_digit` (i.e., `product = 1 * 5 = 5`).
  - The `odd_count` is incremented by 1 (i.e., `odd_count = 0 + 1 = 1`).

After the loop:
- The condition `odd_count == 0` checks if there were no odd digits.
  - Since `odd_count` is 1, this condition is false.
- The `else` branch is taken, and the function returns the `product`, which is 5.

Therefore, the output of the function `digits(5)` is 5.
