[REASONING]
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. The steps involved are:
1. Calculate the mean of the numbers by summing all elements and dividing by the number of elements.
2. For each number in the list, compute the absolute difference between the number and the mean.
3. Sum all the absolute differences.
4. Divide the sum of absolute differences by the number of elements to get the mean absolute deviation.

For the input list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]:
- The mean is calculated as (1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0 + 4.0) / 4 = 2.5.
- The absolute differences from the mean are:
  - |1.0 - 2.5| = 1.5
  - |2.0 - 2.5| = 0.5
  - |3.0 - 2.5| = 0.5
  - |4.0 - 2.5| = 1.5
- The sum of these absolute differences is 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.5 = 4.0.
- The mean absolute deviation is 4.0 / 4 = 1.0.

Thus, the output for the given input is 1.0.

[ANSWER]
```python
from typing import *

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)  # [STATE] mean = 2.5 [/STATE]
    return sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)  # [STATE] return value = 1.0 [/STATE]
```
