The function `strlen` takes a string as input and returns the length of the string using Python's built-in `len()` function.
To determine the output of executing the function `strlen` on the input 'x', we need to calculate the length of the string 'x'.
The string 'x' consists of a single character, so its length is 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `strlen` on the input 'x' is 1.
