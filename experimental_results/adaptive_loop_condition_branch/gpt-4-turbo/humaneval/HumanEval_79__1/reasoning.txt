The function `decimal_to_binary` takes an integer `decimal` as input and converts it to its binary representation. The built-in Python function `bin()` is used to convert the decimal number to a binary string. The `bin()` function returns a string that starts with '0b', which represents that the number is in binary format. In the function, `bin(decimal)[2:]` is used to slice the string and remove the '0b' prefix. The function then concatenates "db" at the beginning and end of the binary string to form the final result.
For the input 103, the binary representation of 103 is '1100111'. After removing the '0b' prefix and adding "db" at the beginning and end, the final output is "db1100111db".
