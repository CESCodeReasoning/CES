The function `sum_product` is called with the argument `numbers = [100, 0]`.
Inside the function, two variables `sum_value` and `prod_value` are initialized to 0 and 1 respectively.
The loop iterates over each element in the list `numbers`.

First Iteration (n = 100):
    `sum_value += n` updates `sum_value` to 100 (0 + 100 = 100).
    `prod_value *= n` updates `prod_value` to 100 (1 * 100 = 100).

Second Iteration (n = 0):
    `sum_value += n` keeps `sum_value` at 100 (100 + 0 = 100).
    `prod_value *= n` updates `prod_value` to 0 (100 * 0 = 0) because multiplying by zero results in zero.

After the loop completes, the function returns a tuple containing the values of `sum_value` and `prod_value`, which are 100 and 0 respectively.
