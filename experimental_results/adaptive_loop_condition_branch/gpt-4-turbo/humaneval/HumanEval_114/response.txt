[REASONING]
The function `minSubArraySum` is called with the list `nums = [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]`.
Inside the function:
- `max_sum` is initialized to 0.
- `s` is initialized to 0.

The loop iterates over each element in the list `nums`.

First Iteration (num = 2):
   - `s` is updated by adding `-num` which results in `s = 0 - 2 = -2`.
   - Since `s < 0`, `s` is reset to 0.
   - `max_sum` remains 0 as `max(0, 0)` is 0.

Second Iteration (num = 3):
   - `s` is updated to `-3`.
   - Again, `s < 0`, so `s` is reset to 0.
   - `max_sum` remains 0.

Third Iteration (num = 4):
   - `s` is updated to `-4`.
   - `s < 0`, so `s` is reset to 0.
   - `max_sum` remains 0.

Fourth Iteration (num = 1):
   - `s` is updated to `-1`.
   - `s < 0`, so `s` is reset to 0.
   - `max_sum` remains 0.

Fifth Iteration (num = 2):
   - `s` is updated to `-2`.
   - `s < 0`, so `s` is reset to 0.
   - `max_sum` remains 0.

Sixth Iteration (num = 4):
   - `s` is updated to `-4`.
   - `s < 0`, so `s` is reset to 0.
   - `max_sum` remains 0.

After the loop, since `max_sum` is still 0, the function checks if `max_sum == 0` which is true.
- It then calculates the maximum of the negative values of elements in `nums`, which is `-1` (from `-min(nums)`).
- `min_sum` is set to `-max_sum` which results in `1`.

Therefore, the minimum subarray sum of the list `[2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]` is `1`.
