[REASONING]
The function `make_a_pile` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list. The list is generated using a list comprehension that iterates over a range of `n` (from 0 to `n-1`). For each index `i` in this range, the expression `n + 2 * i` is computed and added to the list. This expression essentially starts from `n` and increases by 2 for each subsequent element.

To determine the output of executing the function `make_a_pile` on the input `4`, we can manually compute the list:
- When `i = 0`, the expression is `4 + 2*0 = 4`
- When `i = 1`, the expression is `4 + 2*1 = 6`
- When `i = 2`, the expression is `4 + 2*2 = 8`
- When `i = 3`, the expression is `4 + 2*3 = 10`

Thus, the output of executing the function `make_a_pile` on the input `4` is the list `[4, 6, 8, 10]`.

[ANSWER]
```python
from typing import *

def make_a_pile(n: int) -> List[int]:
    # [STATE] n is 4 [/STATE]
    return [n + 2 * i for i in range(n)]  # [STATE] List comprehension returns [4, 6, 8, 10] [/STATE]
```
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[4, 6, 8, 10]
