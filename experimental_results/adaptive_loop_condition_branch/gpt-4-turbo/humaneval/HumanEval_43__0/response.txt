[REASONING]
The function `pairs_sum_to_zero(l)` takes a list `l` as its parameter. The list provided is `[-3, 9, -1, 4, 2, 30]`.
The function iterates through each element in the list using an outer loop and compares each element with every other element that comes after it in the list using an inner loop.
The goal is to find if there exists any pair of numbers in the list that sum up to zero.

First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, `l1` is -3, `j` in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
    - Compare -3 with 9, -1, 4, 2, 30:
        - When j = 1 (l[j]=9), the condition `-3 + 9 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=-1), the condition `-3 + (-1) == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=4), the condition `-3 + 4 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (l[j]=2), the condition `-3 + 2 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (l[j]=30), the condition `-3 + 30 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.

Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, `l1` is 9, `j` in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4, 5.
    - Compare 9 with -1, 4, 2, 30:
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=-1), the condition `9 + (-1) == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=4), the condition `9 + 4 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (l[j]=2), the condition `9 + 2 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (l[j]=30), the condition `9 + 30 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.

Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, `l1` is -1, `j` in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - Compare -1 with 4, 2, 30:
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=4), the condition `-1 + 4 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (l[j]=2), the condition `-1 + 2 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (l[j]=30), the condition `-1 + 30 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.

Fourth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, `l1` is 4, `j` in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - Compare 4 with 2, 30:
        - When j = 4 (l[j]=2), the condition `4 + 2 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (l[j]=30), the condition `4 + 30 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.

Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, `l1` is 2, `j` in the inner loop is 5.
    - Compare 2 with 30:
        - When j = 5 (l[j]=30), the condition `2 + 30 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.

Sixth Iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, `l1` is 30, no more elements to compare.

Since no pairs sum to zero, the function returns False.
