The function `histogram` is called with the input string 'b b b b a'.
1. The string is split into a list `list1` containing the elements ['b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'a'].
2. A dictionary `dict1` is initialized to store the results.
3. A variable `t` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the highest frequency of any word in the list.

First loop:
- Iterates over each word in `list1`.
- For each word, it checks if the count of that word in the list is greater than `t` and if the word is not an empty string.
- The word 'b' appears 4 times, which is greater than `t` (initially 0), so `t` is updated to 4.
- The word 'a' appears once, which is not greater than the current `t` (4), so `t` remains 4.

Second loop:
- Iterates again over each word in `list1`.
- For each word, it checks if the count of that word in the list equals `t` (which is 4).
- The word 'b' meets this condition, so it is added to `dict1` with its count (4).
- The word 'a' does not meet this condition, so it is not added.

The function returns the dictionary `dict1` containing the word 'b' with its highest frequency (4).
