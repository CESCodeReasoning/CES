The function `filter_by_prefix` is designed to filter a list of strings, returning only those strings that start with a specified prefix. The function takes two parameters: `strings`, which is a list of strings, and `prefix`, which is the string prefix to filter by.

In this specific case, the function is called with an empty list `[]` and the prefix 'john'. Since the list is empty, there are no strings to check against the prefix 'john'. Therefore, the list comprehension `[x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]` will iterate over an empty list, and as a result, it will immediately return an empty list because there are no elements to process or match the condition.

Thus, the output of this function call will be an empty list `[]`.
