The function `cycpattern_check(a, b)` is designed to check if string `b` is a cyclic permutation of any substring of string `a` of the same length as `b`. The function takes two strings `a` ("xyzw") and `b` ("xyw") as input.

1. Calculate the length of `b`, which is 3.
2. Create a new string `pat` by concatenating `b` with itself, resulting in "xywxyw".
3. The outer loop iterates over `a` with a range determined by `len(a) - len(b) + 1` which is `4 - 3 + 1 = 2`. This means `i` will take values 0 and 1.
4. The inner loop iterates with a range of `len(b) + 1` which is `3 + 1 = 4`. This means `j` will take values 0, 1, 2, and 3.
5. For each combination of `i` and `j`, the function checks if the substring of `a` starting at `i` and of length `len(b)` is equal to the substring of `pat` starting at `j` and of the same length.
6. For `i=0`, `a[i:i+l]` is "xyz", and it is compared against "xyw", "yw", "wxy", and "xyw" from `pat`. None of these match.
7. For `i=1`, `a[i:i+l]` is "yzw", and it is compared against "xyw", "yw", "wxy", and "xyw" from `pat`. None of these match.
8. Since no match is found in any iteration, the function returns `False`.
