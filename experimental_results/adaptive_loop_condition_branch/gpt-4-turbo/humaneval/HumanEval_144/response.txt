[REASONING]
The function `simplify` is called with the arguments "1/5" and "5/1".
- The string "1/5" is split into `a = "1"` and `b = "5"`.
- The string "5/1" is split into `c = "5"` and `d = "1"`.
- The `numerator` is calculated as `int(a) * int(c) = 1 * 5 = 5`.
- The `denom` (denominator) is calculated as `int(b) * int(d) = 5 * 1 = 5`.
- The division of `numerator` by `denom` is `5 / 5 = 1.0`, which is equal to `int(1.0) = 1`.
- The condition `(numerator/denom == int(numerator/denom))` evaluates to `True` because `1.0 == 1`.
- Since the condition is `True`, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `simplify("1/5", "5/1")` is `True`.
