The function `any_int` is called with the arguments (x = 3, y = 4, z = 7).
First, the function checks if all the arguments `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. Since all are integers, the condition `(isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int))` evaluates to True, and the branch is taken.
Next, the function checks if the sum of any two arguments equals the third argument:
   - `x + y = 3 + 4 = 7` which equals `z`. Thus, `(x + y == z)` is True.
   - The other conditions `(x + z == y)` and `(y + z == x)` are not checked further since the first condition is already True.
Since one of the conditions in the second if statement is True, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `any_int(3, 4, 7)` is True.
