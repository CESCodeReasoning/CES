The function `is_multiply_prime` is called with the argument `a = 3 * 6 * 7 = 126`.
The function checks if the number `a` can be expressed as a product of three distinct prime numbers within the range 2 to 100.

1. The function defines a nested helper function `is_prime(n)` which checks if a number `n` is prime by iterating from 2 to `n-1` and checking if `n` is divisible by any number in this range. If it is divisible, `n` is not prime, and `is_prime` returns `False`. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`.

2. The outer function then iterates over all possible combinations of three numbers `i`, `j`, and `k` from 2 to 100, checking each time if all three numbers are prime using the `is_prime` function.

3. If all three numbers are prime, it then checks if their product equals `a`. If a match is found, it returns `True`.

4. In this specific case, the function will check combinations of prime numbers. However, since 6 is not a prime number, no combination of three prime numbers will result in the product 126. Therefore, the function will eventually return `False` after checking all combinations.
