[REASONING]
The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with the arguments (a = 3, b = 7).
The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
Here's the step-by-step execution:
- Initial values: a = 3, b = 7.
- First Iteration:
  - Since b is not zero, the loop continues.
  - Inside the loop, `a` is assigned the value of `b` (7), and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b` (3 % 7 = 3).
- Second Iteration:
  - New values: a = 7, b = 3.
  - Since b is not zero, the loop continues.
  - Inside the loop, `a` is assigned the value of `b` (3), and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b` (7 % 3 = 1).
- Third Iteration:
  - New values: a = 3, b = 1.
  - Since b is not zero, the loop continues.
  - Inside the loop, `a` is assigned the value of `b` (1), and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b` (3 % 1 = 0).
- Fourth Iteration:
  - New values: a = 1, b = 0.
  - Since b is now zero, the loop terminates.
The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 1, the GCD of 3 and 7.
