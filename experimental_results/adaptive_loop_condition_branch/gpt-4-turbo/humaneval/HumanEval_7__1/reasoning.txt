The function `filter_by_substring` takes two parameters: a list of strings `strings` and a string `substring`. It returns a new list containing only those strings from the input list that contain the specified `substring`.
To determine the output of executing the function `filter_by_substring` on the input list `['xxx', 'asd', 'aaaxxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']` with the substring `'xx'`, we need to check each string in the list to see if it contains the substring `'xx'`.

1. 'xxx' contains 'xx' -> included in the result.
2. 'asd' does not contain 'xx' -> not included.
3. 'aaaxxy' contains 'xx' -> included in the result.
4. 'john doe' does not contain 'xx' -> not included.
5. 'xxxAAA' contains 'xx' -> included in the result.
6. 'xxx' contains 'xx' -> included in the result.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `filter_by_substring` on the given input is `['xxx', 'aaaxxy', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']`.
