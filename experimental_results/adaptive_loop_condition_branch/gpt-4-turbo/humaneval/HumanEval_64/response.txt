[REASONING]
The function `vowels_count` is called with the string "abcde".
The function initializes a string `vowels` containing all vowel characters in both lowercase and uppercase.
It then calculates the number of vowels in the input string "abcde" using a generator expression that checks each character in the string against the `vowels` string. The vowels in "abcde" are 'a' and 'e', so `n_vowels` becomes 2.
Next, the function checks if the last character of the string is 'y' or 'Y'. In this case, the last character is 'e', so the condition `(s[-1] == 'y' or s[-1] == 'Y')` evaluates to False.
Since the condition is False, the branch that would increment `n_vowels` by 1 is not taken.
Finally, the function returns the value of `n_vowels`, which is 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("abcde")` is 2.
