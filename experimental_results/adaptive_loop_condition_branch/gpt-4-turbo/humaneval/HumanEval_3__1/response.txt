[REASONING]
The function `below_zero` is called with the list of operations `[1, -1, 2, -2, 5, -5, 4, -4]`.
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The operation is `1`. The balance becomes `1` (0 + 1).
    - The balance is not less than 0, so the condition is false.
Iteration 2:
    - The operation is `-1`. The balance becomes `0` (1 - 1).
    - The balance is not less than 0, so the condition is false.
Iteration 3:
    - The operation is `2`. The balance becomes `2` (0 + 2).
    - The balance is not less than 0, so the condition is false.
Iteration 4:
    - The operation is `-2`. The balance becomes `0` (2 - 2).
    - The balance is not less than 0, so the condition is false.
Iteration 5:
    - The operation is `5`. The balance becomes `5` (0 + 5).
    - The balance is not less than 0, so the condition is false.
Iteration 6:
    - The operation is `-5`. The balance becomes `0` (5 - 5).
    - The balance is not less than 0, so the condition is false.
Iteration 7:
    - The operation is `4`. The balance becomes `4` (0 + 4).
    - The balance is not less than 0, so the condition is false.
Iteration 8:
    - The operation is `-4`. The balance becomes `0` (4 - 4).
    - The balance is not less than 0, so the condition is false.

After all iterations, the balance never went below zero, so the function returns `False`.
