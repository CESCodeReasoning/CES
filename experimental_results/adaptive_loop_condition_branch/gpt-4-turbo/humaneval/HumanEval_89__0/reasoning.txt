The function `encrypt` is called with the string `s = "et"`.
Inside the function, a string `d` containing the alphabet is defined, and an empty string `out` is initialized to store the result.

Iteration 1:
    - The character 'e' is in the string `d`.
    - The index of 'e' in `d` is 4. The encryption shifts the index by 4 positions (2 * 2), resulting in an index of 8.
    - The character at index 8 in `d` is 'i'.
    - The character 'i' is appended to `out`.

Iteration 2:
    - The character 't' is in the string `d`.
    - The index of 't' in `d` is 19. The encryption shifts the index by 4 positions, resulting in an index of 23.
    - The character at index 23 in `d` is 'w'.
    - The character 'w' is appended to `out`.

The final encrypted string is "iw".
