The function `valid_date` is called with the string '04-2003'.
1. The `date` string is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, though in this case, there are none.
2. The function attempts to split the `date` string using '-' as the delimiter. The expected format is 'MM-DD-YYYY'. However, the input '04-2003' only contains the month and year, missing the day.
3. The split operation results in a list with two elements ['04', '2003'], and when the function tries to unpack these into three variables `month`, `day`, `year`, it raises a `ValueError` because there are not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2).
4. This error is caught by the `except BaseException` block, and the function returns `False` as the date format is incorrect and does not meet the expected 'MM-DD-YYYY' format with valid day, month, and year values.

Therefore, the final output of the function `valid_date('04-2003')` is `False`.
