The function `iscube` checks whether a given integer `a` is a perfect cube. The function first takes the absolute value of `a` to handle negative numbers since the cube root of a negative number can also be an integer. It then computes the cube root of `a` using `a ** (1. / 3)`, rounds it to the nearest integer, and raises this integer to the power of three. The function returns `True` if this value equals the original absolute value of `a`, indicating that `a` is a perfect cube; otherwise, it returns `False`.

For the input `0`, the steps are as follows:
1. Compute the absolute value of `0`, which is `0`.
2. Calculate the cube root of `0`, which is `0.0`.
3. Round `0.0` to the nearest integer, which is `0`.
4. Raise `0` to the power of three, resulting in `0`.
5. Compare this result (`0`) with the absolute value of the input (`0`). Since they are equal, the function returns `True`.

Thus, the output for the input `0` is `True`.
