The function `correct_bracketing` is called with the input string ")((".
The function checks if the brackets in the string are correctly nested and balanced.

1. Initialize `depth` to 0 to keep track of the nesting level of brackets.
2. Iterate over each character in the string ")((":
   - First character ')':
     - It's not an opening bracket, so `depth` is decremented by 1, resulting in `depth = -1`.
     - Check if `depth < 0`, which is true, indicating an unmatched closing bracket. The function returns `False`.
   - The function does not proceed to the next characters because it has already returned `False` due to the unmatched closing bracket.

The function correctly identifies that the brackets are not properly nested and returns `False`.
