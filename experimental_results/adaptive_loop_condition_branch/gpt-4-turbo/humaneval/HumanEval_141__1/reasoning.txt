The function `file_name_check` is called with the argument `file_name = '@this1_is6_valid.exe'`.
1. The function first splits the file name by the period character, resulting in the list `lst = ['@this1_is6_valid', 'exe']`.
2. It checks if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2. In this case, the length is 2, so this condition is false and the branch is not taken.
3. Next, it checks if the second element of `lst` (i.e., 'exe') is not in the list `suf = ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']`. Since 'exe' is in `suf`, this condition is false and the branch is not taken.
4. It then checks if the length of the first element of `lst` (i.e., '@this1_is6_valid') is 0. Since the length is greater than 0, this condition is false and the branch is not taken.
5. The function checks if the first character of the first element of `lst` (i.e., '@') is not an alphabetic character. Since '@' is not alphabetic, this condition is true and the branch is taken, returning 'No'.
6. The function does not proceed to the last condition checking the number of digits in the first element because it has already returned 'No'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `file_name_check('@this1_is6_valid.exe')` is 'No'.
