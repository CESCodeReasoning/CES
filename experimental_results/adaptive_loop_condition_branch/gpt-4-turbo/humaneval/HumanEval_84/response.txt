[REASONING]
The function `solve` takes an integer `N` as input. The steps executed by the function are as follows:
1. Convert the integer `N` to a string to iterate over each digit.
2. Use a generator expression inside the `sum` function to convert each character (digit) back to an integer and sum them up.
3. Convert the resulting sum of the digits to its binary representation using the `bin` function, which returns a string prefixed with '0b'.
4. Slice the binary string to remove the '0b' prefix and return the result.

For the input `1000`:
- Convert `1000` to the string "1000".
- Sum the digits: 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.
- Convert the sum (1) to binary: `bin(1)` results in '0b1'.
- Slice the binary string to remove the '0b', resulting in '1'.

Thus, the output for the input `1000` is '1'.

[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def solve(N: int) -> str:
    # [STATE] N is 1000 [/STATE]
    # Convert N to string, sum the integer values of its digits, convert the sum to binary, and slice off the '0b' prefix
    return bin(sum(int(i) for i in str(N)))[2:]  # [STATE] sum(int(i) for i in str(N)) is 1, bin(...) is '0b1', [2:] slices to '1' [/STATE]
