The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with the input string "yogurt".
1. The function first checks if the length of the word is less than 3. Since "yogurt" has 6 characters, this condition is false.
2. A set of vowels is defined containing both lowercase and uppercase vowels.
3. The function then iterates over the string from the second last character to the second character in reverse order (indices 4 to 1 for "yogurt").
   - Iteration 1 (i = 4): The character at index 4 is 'r', which is not a vowel.
   - Iteration 2 (i = 3): The character at index 3 is 't', which is not a vowel.
   - Iteration 3 (i = 2): The character at index 2 is 'g', which is not a vowel.
   - Iteration 4 (i = 1): The character at index 1 is 'o', which is a vowel.
     - The characters at indices 2 ('g') and 0 ('y') are checked and neither are vowels.
     - Since the adjacent characters are not vowels, 'o' is returned as the closest vowel.
4. The function returns 'o' as the closest vowel surrounded by non-vowel characters.

Therefore, the output of the function `get_closest_vowel("yogurt")` is 'o'.
