[REASONING]
The function `hex_key` is called with the string "2020".
Inside the function, a tuple `primes` is defined containing the characters '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'.
A variable `total` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the count of prime characters found in the input string.

Iteration 1:
    - The character at index 0 is '2', which is in `primes`.
    - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
    - Action: `total` is incremented by 1, resulting in `total = 1`.
Iteration 2:
    - The character at index 1 is '0', which is not in `primes`.
    - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
    - Action: `total` remains 1.
Iteration 3:
    - The character at index 2 is '2', which is in `primes` again.
    - The condition `num[i] in primes` is true.
    - Action: `total` is incremented by 1, resulting in `total = 2`.
Iteration 4:
    - The character at index 3 is '0', which is not in `primes`.
    - The condition `num[i] in primes` is false.
    - Action: `total` remains 2.

After iterating through all characters, the function returns the value of `total`, which is 2, indicating that there are two prime characters in the string "2020".
