The function `is_palindrome` is called with the string 'xyx'.
1. The function first checks if the string is empty. Since 'xyx' is not empty, the condition `(not string)` evaluates to `False`, and the corresponding branch is not taken.
2. The variable `beginning_of_suffix` is initialized to 0.
3. The function enters a while loop that checks if the substring from `beginning_of_suffix` to the end of the string is a palindrome. The function `is_palindrome` is called recursively.
   - First Iteration (`beginning_of_suffix = 0`):
     - The substring is 'xyx', which is a palindrome. Therefore, the condition `(not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]))` evaluates to `False`, and the loop exits.
4. The function returns the original string concatenated with the reverse of the substring from the start of the string up to `beginning_of_suffix` (exclusive). Since `beginning_of_suffix` is 0, the substring is empty, and the reverse is also empty.
5. The final result is the original string 'xyx', as no characters are added to it.
