[REASONING]
The function `strlen` is designed to take a single string argument and return the length of that string. The length of a string is determined by the number of characters it contains.
To determine the output of executing the function `strlen` on the input "asdasnakj", we need to count the number of characters in "asdasnakj".
The string "asdasnakj" contains 9 characters.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `strlen` on the input "asdasnakj" is 9.
[REASONING]

[ANSWER]
```python
from typing import *

def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    # [STATE] string = "asdasnakj" [/STATE]
    return len(string)  # [STATE] len(string) = 9 [/STATE]
```
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
9
