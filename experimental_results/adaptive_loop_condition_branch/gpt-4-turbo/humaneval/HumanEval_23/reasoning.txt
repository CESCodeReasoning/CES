The function `strlen` is designed to take a single string argument and return the length of that string. The length of a string is determined by the number of characters it contains.
To determine the output of executing the function `strlen` on the input "asdasnakj", we need to count the number of characters in "asdasnakj".
The string "asdasnakj" contains 9 characters.
