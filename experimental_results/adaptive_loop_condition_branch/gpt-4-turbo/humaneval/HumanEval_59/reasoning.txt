The function `largest_prime_factor` is called with `n = 15`.
Inside the function, a variable `largest` is initialized to 1.
The function iterates from 2 through 15 (since `n = 15`).

Iteration 1 (j = 2):
   - `j` is 2, which is a prime number.
   - `15 % 2` is not 0, so the condition `(n % j == 0 and is_prime(j))` is false.

Iteration 2 (j = 3):
   - `j` is 3, which is a prime number.
   - `15 % 3` is 0, so the condition `(n % j == 0 and is_prime(j))` is true.
   - Action: `largest` is updated to 3.

Iteration 3 (j = 4):
   - `j` is 4, which is not a prime number.
   - The condition `(n % j == 0 and is_prime(j))` is false.

Iteration 4 (j = 5):
   - `j` is 5, which is a prime number.
   - `15 % 5` is 0, so the condition `(n % j == 0 and is_prime(j))` is true.
   - Action: `largest` is updated to 5.

Iterations 5 to 15 (j = 6 to 15):
   - None of these values of `j` are prime factors of 15.
   - The condition `(n % j == 0 and is_prime(j))` remains false for all these iterations.

Return Statement:
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `largest`, which is now 5.

Therefore, the final output of the function `largest_prime_factor(15)` is 5.
