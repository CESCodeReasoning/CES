[REASONING]
The function `double_the_difference` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of the squares of all elements that meet the following conditions:
1. The element is greater than 0.
2. The element is odd (i.e., not divisible by 2).
3. The element does not contain a decimal point (it is an integer).

The function uses a list comprehension to filter and process the elements of the list. The list comprehension iterates over each element `i` in the list `lst`. For each element, it checks if `i` is greater than 0, if `i` modulo 2 is not equal to 0 (meaning `i` is odd), and if the string representation of `i` does not contain a dot (meaning `i` is an integer). If all these conditions are met, `i**2` (the square of `i`) is included in the new list generated by the list comprehension. The `sum` function then adds up all the squared values from this list and returns the result.

In the given input, the list is empty (`[]`). Therefore, the list comprehension has no elements to iterate over, and it immediately returns an empty list. The sum of an empty list is 0.

Thus, the output of executing the function `double_the_difference` on the input `[]` is 0.

    # [STATE] lst is [] [/STATE]
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i % 2 != 0 and "." not in str(i)])  # [CONDITION] i > 0 and i % 2 != 0 and "." not in str(i) [/CONDITION] [BRANCH] N [/BRANCH]
