[REASONING]
The function `multiply` takes two integers, `a` and `b`, as input. It calculates the product of the last digits of both integers. 
To find the last digit of an integer, the modulus operation with 10 is used (`a % 10` for `a` and `b % 10` for `b`). 
The `abs` function ensures that the result is non-negative, even if the input numbers are negative.
For the input values 148 and 412:
- The last digit of 148 is 148 % 10 = 8.
- The last digit of 412 is 412 % 10 = 2.
The product of these last digits is 8 * 2 = 16.
Thus, the output of the function `multiply` with inputs 148 and 412 is 16.

[ANSWER]
```python
from typing import *

def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # [STATE] a % 10 = 8, b % 10 = 2 [/STATE]
    return abs(a % 10) * abs(b % 10)  # [STATE] abs(8) * abs(2) = 16 [/STATE]
```
