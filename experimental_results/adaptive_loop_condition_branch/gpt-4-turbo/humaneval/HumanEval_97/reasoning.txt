The function `multiply` takes two integers, `a` and `b`, as input. It calculates the product of the last digits of both integers. 
To find the last digit of an integer, the modulus operation with 10 is used (`a % 10` for `a` and `b % 10` for `b`). 
The `abs` function ensures that the result is non-negative, even if the input numbers are negative.
For the input values 148 and 412:
- The last digit of 148 is 148 % 10 = 8.
- The last digit of 412 is 412 % 10 = 2.
The product of these last digits is 8 * 2 = 16.
Thus, the output of the function `multiply` with inputs 148 and 412 is 16.
