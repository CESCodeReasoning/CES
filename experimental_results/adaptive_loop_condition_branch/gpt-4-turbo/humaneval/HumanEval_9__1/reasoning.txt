The function `rolling_max` is called with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to `None` and an empty list `result` is created to store the running maximum values.

Iteration 1:
    - The number `n` is 1.
    - Since `running_max` is `None`, the condition `(running_max is None)` is true.
    - `running_max` is updated to 1.
    - The value 1 is appended to `result`.

Iteration 2:
    - The number `n` is 2.
    - `running_max` is not `None` now, so the `else` branch is taken.
    - `running_max` is updated to the maximum of 1 and 2, which is 2.
    - The value 2 is appended to `result`.

Iteration 3:
    - The number `n` is 3.
    - Again, the `else` branch is taken.
    - `running_max` is updated to the maximum of 2 and 3, which is 3.
    - The value 3 is appended to `result`.

Iteration 4:
    - The number `n` is 4.
    - The `else` branch is taken.
    - `running_max` is updated to the maximum of 3 and 4, which is 4.
    - The value 4 is appended to `result`.

The function returns the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]` which represents the running maximum values for each element in the input list.
