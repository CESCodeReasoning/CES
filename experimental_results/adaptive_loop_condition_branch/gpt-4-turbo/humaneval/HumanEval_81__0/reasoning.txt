The function `numerical_letter_grade` is called with a list containing a single GPA value, `[1.2]`.
Inside the function, an empty list `letter_grade` is initialized to store the corresponding letter grades for each GPA in the input list.

Iteration 1:
    - The GPA `1.2` is evaluated against multiple conditions to determine the corresponding letter grade.
    - The condition `gpa == 4.0` is false.
    - Subsequent conditions `gpa > 3.7`, `gpa > 3.3`, ..., `gpa > 1.3` are all false because `1.2` is less than these values.
    - The condition `gpa > 1.0` is true (since `1.2 > 1.0`).
    - The corresponding letter grade "D+" is appended to the `letter_grade` list.
    - No further conditions are checked after a match is found.

The function returns the list `["D+"]` as the output, representing the letter grade for the input GPA list `[1.2]`.
