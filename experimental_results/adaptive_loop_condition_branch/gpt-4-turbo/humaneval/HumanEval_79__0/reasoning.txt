The function `decimal_to_binary` takes an integer `decimal` as input and converts it to its binary representation using Python's built-in `bin()` function. The `bin()` function returns a binary string prefixed with '0b'. The code slices off the first two characters ('0b') using `[2:]` to get the pure binary representation. Then, it concatenates "db" at the beginning and end of this binary string to form the final result.
For the input 32, the binary representation of 32 is '100000'. After slicing off '0b', we concatenate "db" at the start and end, resulting in "db100000db".
