The function `histogram` is called with the input string 'a b b a'.
1. The string is split into a list `list1` containing the elements ['a', 'b', 'b', 'a'].
2. A dictionary `dict1` is initialized to store the results.
3. A variable `t` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the highest frequency of any word in the list.

First loop:
- Iterates over each word in `list1`.
- For each word, it checks if the count of that word in `list1` is greater than `t` and if the word is not an empty string.
- For 'a', the count is 2, which is greater than `t` (0), so `t` is updated to 2.
- For 'b', the count is also 2, but since `t` is already 2, `t` remains unchanged.
- The loop completes with `t` equal to 2.

Second loop:
- Checks if `t` is greater than 0, which it is.
- Iterates again over each word in `list1`.
- For each word, it checks if the count of that word in `list1` is equal to `t`.
- Both 'a' and 'b' have counts equal to `t` (2), so they are added to `dict1` with their counts.

The function returns the dictionary `dict1` containing the words with the highest frequency and their counts.

Therefore, the output of the function `histogram('a b b a')` is `{'a': 2, 'b': 2}`.
