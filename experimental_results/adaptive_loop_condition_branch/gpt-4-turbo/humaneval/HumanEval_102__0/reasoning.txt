The function `choose_num` is called with parameters (x = 13, y = 12).
1. The first condition checks if `x > y`. Since 13 is greater than 12, this condition is true.
2. As the condition is true, the function immediately returns -1 without checking the other conditions.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(13, 12)` is -1.
