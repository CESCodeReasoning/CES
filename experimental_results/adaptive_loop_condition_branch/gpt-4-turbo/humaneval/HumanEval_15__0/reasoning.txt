The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string that contains a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n`, separated by spaces. 
To determine the output of executing the function `string_sequence` on the input `3`, we need to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 3. This sequence is [0, 1, 2, 3].
These numbers are then converted to strings and joined together with spaces to form the final string "0 1 2 3".
Therefore, the output of executing the function `string_sequence` on the input `3` is "0 1 2 3".
