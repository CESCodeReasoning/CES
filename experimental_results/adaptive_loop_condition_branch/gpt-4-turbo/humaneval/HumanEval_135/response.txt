[REASONING]
The function `can_arrange` is called with the list `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`.
Inside the function, a variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The loop iterates from 1 through the length of the array minus one (since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(arr) - 1`).

First Iteration (i = 1):
    - `arr[i]` is 2 and `arr[i-1]` is 1.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` (2 < 1) is false. The branch is not taken.

Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - `arr[i]` is 4 and `arr[i-1]` is 2.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` (4 < 2) is false. The branch is not taken.

Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - `arr[i]` is 3 and `arr[i-1]` is 4.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` (3 < 4) is true. The branch is taken.
    - `ind` is updated to 3.

Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    - `arr[i]` is 5 and `arr[i-1]` is 3.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` (5 < 3) is false. The branch is not taken.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is now 3, indicating the index where the array element is less than the previous element.
