[REASONING]
The function `search` is called with the list `[5, 5, 5, 5, 1]`.
Inside the function:
1. A frequency list `frq` is initialized with zeros. The length of `frq` is determined by the maximum value in the input list plus one, which is `max(lst) + 1 = 6`.
2. The list `frq` is updated to count the occurrences of each element in the input list. After processing the input list:
   - `frq[1]` becomes 1 (since 1 appears once).
   - `frq[5]` becomes 4 (since 5 appears four times).
   - All other indices in `frq` remain 0.
3. The variable `ans` is initialized to -1.
4. A loop iterates over the range from 1 to the length of `frq` (which is 6). During each iteration:
   - For `i = 1`, `frq[1]` is 1, which is equal to `i`. Thus, `ans` is updated to 1.
   - For `i = 2`, `frq[2]` is 0, which is less than `i`. No update to `ans`.
   - For `i = 3`, `frq[3]` is 0, which is less than `i`. No update to `ans`.
   - For `i = 4`, `frq[4]` is 0, which is less than `i`. No update to `ans`.
   - For `i = 5`, `frq[5]` is 4, which is less than `i`. No update to `ans`.
5. The function returns the value of `ans`, which is 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])` is 1.
