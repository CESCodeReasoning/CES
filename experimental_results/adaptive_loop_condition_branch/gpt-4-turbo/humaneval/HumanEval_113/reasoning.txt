The function `odd_count` is called with a list containing a single string '1234567'.
Inside the function, an empty list `res` is initialized to store the results.
The function then iterates over the list `lst`, which contains only one element in this case: '1234567'.

For the single iteration (arr = '1234567'):
- The generator expression `int(d)%2==1 for d in arr` is used to count the number of odd digits in the string '1234567'.
- The digits in '1234567' are '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7'.
- The odd digits among them are '1', '3', '5', '7'. Thus, there are 4 odd digits.
- The count `n` is determined to be 4.
- A string is constructed using `n` and appended to the list `res`: "the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."

After the loop, the function returns the list `res` containing the result string.
