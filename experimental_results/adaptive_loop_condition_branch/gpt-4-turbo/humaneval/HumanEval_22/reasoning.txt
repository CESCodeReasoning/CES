The function `filter_integers` is designed to take a list of elements, `values`, which can be of any type, and return a new list containing only the elements that are integers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `x` in the input list `values`. For each element, it checks whether the element is an instance of the integer type using the `isinstance(x, int)` function. If the condition is true, the element `x` is included in the new list. Otherwise, it is excluded. 

For the given input `[3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b']`, the function will iterate over each element:
1. `3` is an integer, so it is included.
2. `'c'` is not an integer, so it is excluded.
3. `3` is an integer, so it is included.
4. `3` is an integer, so it is included.
5. `'a'` is not an integer, so it is excluded.
6. `'b'` is not an integer, so it is excluded.

Thus, the output list will only contain the integers from the input list, which are `[3, 3, 3]`.
