The function `order_by_points` is called with a list of integers. The function sorts these integers based on the sum of their digits, which is calculated by the nested function `digits_sum`.

For each number in the list:
1. If the number is negative, it is converted to positive, and a flag `neg` is set to -1 to remember that it was originally negative.
2. The number is then converted to a list of its digits.
3. If the number was originally negative, the first digit is multiplied by -1 to reflect the original sign in the sum.
4. The sum of the digits is calculated and returned.
5. The outer function sorts the list of numbers based on these sums.

The sorting is done in ascending order based on the sum of the digits. The function returns the sorted list.

For example, for the number 1234:
- It is positive, so `neg` remains 1.
- It is converted to the list of digits [1, 2, 3, 4].
- The sum of these digits is 10.

This process is repeated for each number in the list, and finally, the list is sorted based on these sums.

Therefore, the final output of the function `order_by_points` with the given list of integers will be a list sorted by the sum of the digits of each number.
