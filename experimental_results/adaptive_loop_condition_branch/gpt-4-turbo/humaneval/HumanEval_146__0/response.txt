[REASONING]
The function `specialFilter` is called with the argument `nums = [1]`.
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.
The function iterates over the list `nums`, which contains only one element: 1.

Iteration 1:
   - The number `1` is checked against the condition `num > 10`.
   - Since `1` is not greater than `10`, the condition is false.
   - The branch inside the `if` statement is not taken because the condition is not met.
   - No further checks or actions are performed for this number.

Since there are no numbers in the list that meet the condition `num > 10`, the loop completes without any increments to `count`.

The function returns the value of `count`, which remains 0, as no numbers in the input list met the criteria specified in the function.

Therefore, the final output of the function `specialFilter([1])` is 0.

    for num in nums: ## [STATE]num=[1][/STATE][STATE]nums=[[1]][/STATE]
        if num > 10: ## [CONDITION](num > 10)=[False][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[N][/BRANCH]
            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
            number_as_string = str(num)
            if int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(
                    number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits:
                count += 1

    return count
