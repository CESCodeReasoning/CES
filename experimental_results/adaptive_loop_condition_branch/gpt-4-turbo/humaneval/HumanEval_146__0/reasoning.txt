The function `specialFilter` is called with the argument `nums = [1]`.
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.
The function iterates over the list `nums`, which contains only one element: 1.

Iteration 1:
   - The number `1` is checked against the condition `num > 10`.
   - Since `1` is not greater than `10`, the condition is false.
   - The branch inside the `if` statement is not taken because the condition is not met.
   - No further checks or actions are performed for this number.

Since there are no numbers in the list that meet the condition `num > 10`, the loop completes without any increments to `count`.

The function returns the value of `count`, which remains 0, as no numbers in the input list met the criteria specified in the function.

Therefore, the final output of the function `specialFilter([1])` is 0.
