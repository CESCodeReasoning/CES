The function `fizz_buzz` is called with `n = 200`.
Inside the function:
1. An empty list `ns` is initialized to store numbers.
2. A loop iterates from 0 to 199 (since `n = 200`).
   - For each `i`, it checks if `i` is divisible by 11 or 13.
   - If true, `i` is appended to the list `ns`.
3. After the loop, the list `ns` is converted to a string `s` by mapping each integer to a string and then joining them.
4. Another loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - It increments `ans` by 1 for each '7' found in the string.
5. The function returns the count of '7's in the string representation of numbers divisible by 11 or 13 from 0 to 199.

Step-by-step loop details:
- Numbers divisible by 11 or 13 within the range are: 0, 11, 13, 22, 26, 33, 39, 44, 52, 55, 57, 65, 66, 77, 78, 88, 91, 99, 104, 110, 114, 117, 121, 130, 132, 143, 143, 154, 156, 165, 169, 176, 182, 187, 195, 198.
- The string `s` formed from these numbers is '01113222633394455565766677778889104110114117121130132143143154156165169176182187195198'.
- The count of '7's in this string is calculated in the final loop.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fizz_buzz(200)` is the count of '7's in the string, which is 14.
