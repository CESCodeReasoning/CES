The function `add` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of elements that are located at odd indices (1-based) and are even numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to filter and sum these elements.

1. The input list is `[4, 0, 6, 7]`.
2. The list comprehension iterates over the indices of the list that are odd (1-based), which correspond to even indices (0-based) in Python. These indices are 1 and 3.
3. For each of these indices, the function checks if the element at that index is even:
   - `lst[1]` is 0, which is even.
   - `lst[3]` is 7, which is not even.
4. The list comprehension thus collects the elements `[0]` from the indices that meet the condition.
5. The sum of the collected elements is `0`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `add` on the input `[4, 0, 6, 7]` is `0`.
