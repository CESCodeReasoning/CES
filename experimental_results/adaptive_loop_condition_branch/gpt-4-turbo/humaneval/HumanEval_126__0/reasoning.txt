The function `is_sorted` is called with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
1. A dictionary `count_digit` is initialized using a list comprehension that iterates over the input list. Each element is used as a key with an initial value of 0. After initialization, `count_digit` is `{1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0}`.
2. The function then iterates over the list `lst` and increments the count of each element in the `count_digit` dictionary. After this loop, `count_digit` becomes `{1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}`.
3. The first conditional checks if any element in `count_digit` has a count greater than 2. This is done using a generator expression. Since all counts are 1, the condition evaluates to `False`, and this branch is not taken.
4. The second conditional checks if all adjacent elements in the list `lst` satisfy the condition `lst[i - 1] <= lst[i]`. This is also done using a generator expression iterating from index 1 to the end of the list. Since the list is sorted in ascending order, this condition evaluates to `True`, and this branch is taken.
5. The function returns `True` indicating that the list is sorted.
