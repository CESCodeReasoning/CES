The function `median` is called with the list `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`.
1. The list is first sorted, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
2. The length of the list is 5, which is an odd number.
3. Since the length is odd, the median is the middle element of the sorted list, which is at index `len(l) // 2` (i.e., `5 // 2 = 2`). The element at index 2 is `3`.
4. Therefore, the function returns `3` as the median.

Thus, the final output of the function `median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])` is `3`.
