The function `intersperse` is called with the arguments `numbers = [2, 2, 2]` and `delimeter = 2`.
First, the function checks if the `numbers` list is empty. Since it is not empty, the condition `(not numbers)` evaluates to `False`, and the corresponding branch is not taken.
Next, an empty list `result` is initialized.
The function then enters a loop over `numbers[:-1]`, which means it iterates over all elements of `numbers` except the last one. In this case, `numbers[:-1]` is `[2, 2]`.
During the first iteration, `n = 2`. The number `2` and the `delimeter` `2` are appended to `result`, making `result = [2, 2]`.
During the second iteration, `n = 2` again. Another `2` and another `delimeter` `2` are appended to `result`, making `result = [2, 2, 2, 2]`.
After the loop, the last element of `numbers`, which is `numbers[-1] = 2`, is appended to `result`, resulting in `result = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`.
The function returns the `result` list.
