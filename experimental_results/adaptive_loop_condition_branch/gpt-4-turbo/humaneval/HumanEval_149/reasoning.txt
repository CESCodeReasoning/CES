The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with the list `["aa", "a", "aaa"]`.
Inside the function:
1. The list `lst` is sorted alphabetically, resulting in `["a", "aa", "aaa"]`.
2. A new list `new_lst` is initialized as an empty list.
3. The function iterates over the sorted list `lst`.

First Iteration (i = "a"):
   - The length of "a" is 1, which is odd.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is false.
   - The branch is not taken, and "a" is not added to `new_lst`.

Second Iteration (i = "aa"):
   - The length of "aa" is 2, which is even.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - The branch is taken, and "aa" is added to `new_lst`.

Third Iteration (i = "aaa"):
   - The length of "aaa" is 3, which is odd.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is false.
   - The branch is not taken, and "aaa" is not added to `new_lst`.

4. After the loop, the function returns `new_lst` sorted by the length of its elements. Since `new_lst` contains only ["aa"], it is returned as is.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sorted_list_sum(["aa", "a", "aaa"])` is ["aa"].
