[REASONING]
The function `digitSum` is called with the string "You arE Very Smart".
1. The function first checks if the input string `s` is empty. In this case, `s` is "You arE Very Smart", so it is not empty.
   - The condition `(s == "")` evaluates to `False`.
   - Therefore, the branch for this condition is not taken.
2. The function then proceeds to calculate the sum of the ASCII values of uppercase characters in the string.
   - The generator expression inside the `sum` function iterates over each character in the string.
   - For each character, it checks if the character is uppercase using `char.isupper()`.
   - If the character is uppercase, it returns the ASCII value of the character using `ord(char)`. If not, it returns 0.
   - The characters that are uppercase in "You arE Very Smart" are 'Y', 'E', 'V', 'S'.
   - Their ASCII values are 89, 69, 86, and 83 respectively.
   - The sum of these values is 89 + 69 + 86 + 83 = 327.
3. The function returns the sum, which is 327.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digitSum("You arE Very Smart")` is 327.
