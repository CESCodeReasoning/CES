[REASONING]
The function `file_name_check` is called with the argument 'I563_No.exe'.
1. The file name is split by the '.' character resulting in the list `lst = ['I563_No', 'exe']`.
2. The length of `lst` is checked. Since it is 2, the first condition `(len(lst) != 2)` is false, so this branch is not taken.
3. The second element of `lst` (i.e., 'exe') is checked against the list `suf = ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']`. Since 'exe' is in `suf`, the second condition `(not lst[1] in suf)` is false, so this branch is not taken.
4. The length of the first element of `lst` (i.e., 'I563_No') is checked. It is not zero, so the third condition `(len(lst[0]) == 0)` is false, and this branch is not taken.
5. The first character of the first element of `lst` (i.e., 'I') is checked if it is alphabetic. It is, so the fourth condition `(not lst[0][0].isalpha())` is false, and this branch is not taken.
6. The number of digits in the first element of `lst` is counted, resulting in `t = 3`. The condition `(t > 3)` is false, so this branch is not taken.
7. Since none of the conditions that would return 'No' are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `file_name_check('I563_No.exe')` is 'Yes'.
