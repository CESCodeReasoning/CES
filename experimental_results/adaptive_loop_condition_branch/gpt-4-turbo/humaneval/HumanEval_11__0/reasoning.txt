The function `string_xor` is called with two strings `a` and `b`, both containing the character '1'.
The function defines a nested function `xor` which takes two characters `i` and `j`. It compares these characters:
- If `i` is equal to `j`, it returns '0'.
- Otherwise, it returns '1'.
In this case, since both `a` and `b` are '1', the characters are equal.
The `xor` function is called with `i = '1'` and `j = '1'`, and since they are equal, '0' is returned.
The `string_xor` function then joins this result into a string, which results in '0'.

Therefore, the final output of the function `string_xor('1', '1')` is '0'.
