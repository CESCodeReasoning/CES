The function `largest_divisor` is called with ( n = 49 ).
Inside the function, a loop iterates over the range from `n-1` to 1 in reverse order (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1` and `reversed(range(n))` will start from `n-1` and go down to 0).

Iteration 1:
   - `i` is 48, and 49 % 48 is not 0.
Iteration 2:
   - `i` is 47, and 49 % 47 is not 0.
   - ...
   - This continues until `i` is 7.
Iteration 7:
   - `i` is 7, and 49 % 7 is 0, which means 7 is a divisor of 49.
   - Since this is the first divisor found in reverse order, it is the largest divisor other than the number itself.

The loop stops when it finds the first divisor, which is 7, and returns this value.
