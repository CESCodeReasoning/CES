[REASONING]
The function `remove_vowels` takes a string `text` as input and returns a new string that is formed by removing all vowels from the input string. The vowels considered are "a", "e", "i", "o", "u" in both uppercase and lowercase.
To achieve this, the function uses a list comprehension that iterates over each character `s` in the input string `text`. For each character, it checks if `s.lower()` is not in the list of vowels ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]. If the character is not a vowel, it is included in the resulting list.
This list of non-vowel characters is then joined into a string using `"".join()`, which concatenates all the elements of the list into a single string.
For the input 'fedcba', the characters are checked one by one:
- 'f' is not a vowel, so it is included.
- 'e' is a vowel, so it is excluded.
- 'd' is not a vowel, so it is included.
- 'c' is not a vowel, so it is included.
- 'b' is not a vowel, so it is included.
- 'a' is a vowel, so it is excluded.
The resulting string after removing vowels from 'fedcba' is 'fdcb'.

from typing import *

def remove_vowels(text: str) -> str:
    # [STATE] text = 'fedcba' [/STATE]
    return "".join([s for s in text if s.lower() not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]])  # [CONDITION] s.lower() not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"] [/CONDITION]
    # [BRANCH] Y [/BRANCH] for characters 'f', 'd', 'c', 'b'
    # [BRANCH] N [/BRANCH] for characters 'e', 'a'
