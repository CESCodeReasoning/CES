The function `sort_numbers` takes a string of number words as input and returns a string of these number words sorted in ascending numerical order. The function uses a dictionary `value_map` to map number words to their corresponding numerical values.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. The input string 'three five nine' is split into a list of words: ['three', 'five', 'nine'].
2. The list comprehension filters out any empty strings, but since there are none in this case, it remains unchanged.
3. The `sorted` function sorts this list based on the numerical values of the words, as defined in `value_map`. The lambda function `lambda x: value_map[x]` is used as the key for sorting.
4. The sorted list of words based on their numerical values is ['three', 'five', 'nine'] which corresponds to the numerical order [3, 5, 9].
5. The sorted list is then joined back into a single string with spaces separating the words, resulting in 'three five nine'.

Thus, the output of the function when given the input 'three five nine' is 'three five nine', as the words are already in ascending order based on their numerical values.
