[REASONING]
The function `odd_count` is called with a list of strings `lst = ['271', '137', '314']`.
Inside the function, an empty list `res` is initialized to store the results.
The function iterates over each string in the list `lst`.

First Iteration (arr = '271'):
    The string '271' is processed character by character to count the odd digits.
    Digits: '2' (even), '7' (odd), '1' (odd) -> 2 odd digits.
    The result string for this iteration is constructed and appended to `res`.

Second Iteration (arr = '137'):
    The string '137' is processed character by character to count the odd digits.
    Digits: '1' (odd), '3' (odd), '7' (odd) -> 3 odd digits.
    The result string for this iteration is constructed and appended to `res`.

Third Iteration (arr = '314'):
    The string '314' is processed character by character to count the odd digits.
    Digits: '3' (odd), '1' (odd), '4' (even) -> 2 odd digits.
    The result string for this iteration is constructed and appended to `res`.

After processing all strings in the list, the function returns the list `res` containing the results for each string.
