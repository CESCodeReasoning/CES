The function `remove_duplicates` is designed to remove all elements from a list that appear more than once. It takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers with duplicates removed.

1. The function starts by importing the `collections` module and then uses the `Counter` class from this module to count the occurrences of each element in the input list.
2. A `Counter` object `c` is created from the input list `numbers`. This object holds the count of each element in the list.
3. The function then uses a list comprehension to create a new list. This list includes only those elements `n` from the original list `numbers` for which the count `c[n]` is less than or equal to 1. This effectively filters out any numbers that appear more than once.
4. The resulting list, which contains no duplicates, is returned.

In this specific case, the input list is empty. Therefore:
- The `Counter` object `c` will also be empty because there are no elements to count.
- The list comprehension will iterate over an empty list, resulting in an empty list being returned.

Thus, the output for the input `[]` will be an empty list `[]`.
