The function `smallest_change` is called with the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]`.
The purpose of this function is to determine the minimum number of changes required to make the array a palindrome.

The length of the array is 7, so the loop will iterate over the first half of the array, which is the range from 0 to `len(arr) // 2` (i.e., 0 to 3).

Iteration 1 (i = 0):
   - Compare `arr[0]` (which is 1) with `arr[6]` (which is 2).
   - They are not equal, so `ans` is incremented by 1.

Iteration 2 (i = 1):
   - Compare `arr[1]` (which is 2) with `arr[5]` (which is 2).
   - They are equal, so `ans` remains unchanged.

Iteration 3 (i = 2):
   - Compare `arr[2]` (which is 3) with `arr[4]` (which is 3).
   - They are equal, so `ans` remains unchanged.

Iteration 4 (i = 3):
   - Compare `arr[3]` (which is 4) with `arr[3]` (which is 4).
   - They are equal, so `ans` remains unchanged.

After completing the loop, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is 1. This indicates that only one change is needed to make the array a palindrome.
