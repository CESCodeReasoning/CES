[REASONING]
The function `count_up_to(n)` is designed to find all prime numbers less than a given number `n` (in this case, 22). The function initializes an empty list `primes` to store the prime numbers.

The outer loop iterates over each number `i` starting from 2 up to `n-1` (21 in this case). For each number `i`, it assumes the number is prime (`is_prime = True`).

The inner loop checks if the current number `i` can be divided evenly by any number `j` that is between 2 and `i-1`. If such a `j` is found, it means `i` is not a prime number (`is_prime = False`), and the loop breaks.

If after checking all possible divisors `j` the `is_prime` flag is still `True`, the number `i` is appended to the `primes` list.

The function finally returns the list of prime numbers found.

Step-by-step for `n=22`:
- For `i=2`, the inner loop does not execute because `range(2, 2)` is empty. `is_prime` remains `True`, so 2 is added to `primes`.
- For `i=3`, similar to `i=2`, the inner loop does not execute, so 3 is added.
- For `i=4`, the inner loop checks `j=2`, finds that `4 % 2 == 0`, sets `is_prime` to `False`, and breaks.
- This process continues, checking each number up to 21, adding prime numbers to the list.

The prime numbers less than 22 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19.
