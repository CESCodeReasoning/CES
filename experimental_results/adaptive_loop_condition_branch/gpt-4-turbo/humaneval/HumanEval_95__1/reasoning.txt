The function `check_dict_case` is called with a dictionary containing three key-value pairs: {"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"}.
1. The function first checks if the dictionary is empty. Since it's not, the `else` branch is taken.
2. The variable `state` is initialized to "start".
3. The function then iterates over the keys of the dictionary.
   - First key: "Name"
     - It's a string, so the condition `isinstance(key, str) == False` is false.
     - Since `state` is "start", it checks if "Name" is uppercase. It's not, so it checks if it's lowercase. It's not, so the loop breaks without changing the state.
   - Since the loop breaks in the first iteration, the remaining keys are not checked.
4. After the loop, the function checks if `state` is either "upper" or "lower". Since `state` remains "start", the function returns False.

Therefore, the function `check_dict_case` returns False for the input dictionary.
