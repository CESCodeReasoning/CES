The function `is_palindrome` is called with the input string 'aaaaa'.
The function checks if the input string is a palindrome by comparing characters symmetrically from the start and end towards the center.

1. The length of the string 'aaaaa' is 5.
2. The loop iterates from 0 to 4 (inclusive), which corresponds to the indices of the string.

Iteration 1 (i = 0):
   - Compare the first character ('a') with the last character ('a').
   - They are equal, so continue to the next iteration.

Iteration 2 (i = 1):
   - Compare the second character ('a') with the second last character ('a').
   - They are equal, so continue to the next iteration.

Iteration 3 (i = 2):
   - Compare the middle character ('a') with itself ('a').
   - They are equal, so continue to the next iteration.

Iteration 4 (i = 3):
   - Compare the second last character ('a') with the second character ('a').
   - They are equal, so continue to the next iteration.

Iteration 5 (i = 4):
   - Compare the last character ('a') with the first character ('a').
   - They are equal, so continue to the next iteration.

Since all corresponding characters are equal and no inequality is found, the loop completes without returning `False`. Therefore, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string 'aaaaa' is a palindrome.
