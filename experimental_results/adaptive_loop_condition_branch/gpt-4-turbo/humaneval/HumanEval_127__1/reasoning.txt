The function `intersection` is called with two intervals: `interval1 = [-1, 1]` and `interval2 = [0, 4]`.
1. The function calculates the maximum of the starting points of the intervals, which is `max(-1, 0) = 0`.
2. The function calculates the minimum of the ending points of the intervals, which is `min(1, 4) = 1`.
3. The length of the intersection is calculated as `r - l = 1 - 0 = 1`.
4. The function then checks if the length (1) is greater than 0 and if it is a prime number.
5. The `is_prime` function is called with `num = 1`.
   - It checks if `num` is 1 or 0, which is true for `num = 1`.
   - Since `num = 1` is not a prime number, `is_prime` returns `False`.
6. Since `is_prime(length)` returns `False`, the condition `(length > 0 and is_prime(length))` evaluates to `False`.
7. The function `intersection` returns "NO" because the length of the intersection is not a prime number.

Therefore, the output of the function `intersection([-1, 1], [0, 4])` is "NO".
