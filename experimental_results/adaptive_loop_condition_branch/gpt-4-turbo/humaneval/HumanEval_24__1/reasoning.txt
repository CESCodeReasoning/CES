The function `largest_divisor` is called with ( n = 100 ).
Inside the function, a loop iterates over the numbers from `n-1` to 1 in reverse order (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1` and `reversed(range(n))` reverses this sequence).

Iteration 1:
   - `i` is 99.
   - The condition `100 % 99 == 0` is false.
Iteration 2:
   - `i` is 98.
   - The condition `100 % 98 == 0` is false.
Iteration 3:
   - `i` is 97.
   - The condition `100 % 97 == 0` is false.
...
Iteration 49:
   - `i` is 51.
   - The condition `100 % 51 == 0` is false.
Iteration 50:
   - `i` is 50.
   - The condition `100 % 50 == 0` is true.
   - Since the condition is true, the function returns `i` which is 50.

Therefore, the largest divisor of 100, other than itself, is 50.
