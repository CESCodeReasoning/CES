The function `circular_shift` is called with parameters (x = 12, shift = 1).
- The integer `x` is converted to a string `s`, resulting in `s = "12"`.
- The length of `s` is 2.
- The condition checks if `shift` (which is 1) is greater than the length of `s` (which is 2). This condition is false (`shift > len(s)` is `1 > 2` which is false).
- Since the condition is false, the else branch is executed.
- In the else branch, the string `s` is manipulated to perform a circular shift:
  - `s[len(s) - shift:]` takes the substring from index `len(s) - shift` (which is `2 - 1 = 1`) to the end, resulting in `"2"`.
  - `s[:len(s) - shift]` takes the substring from the start to index `len(s) - shift` (which is `2 - 1 = 1`), resulting in `"1"`.
  - Concatenating these two parts gives `"21"`.
- The function returns the string `"21"`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(12, 1)` is `"21"`.
