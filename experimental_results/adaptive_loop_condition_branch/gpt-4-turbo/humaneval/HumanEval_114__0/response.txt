[REASONING]
The function `minSubArraySum` is called with the list `nums = [1, -1]`.
Inside the function, two variables `max_sum` and `s` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The number `1` is processed. The variable `s` is updated by adding `-1` (i.e., `-num`), resulting in `s = -1`.
    - The condition `(s < 0)` is true, so `s` is reset to 0.
    - `max_sum` remains 0 as `max(s, max_sum)` is `max(0, 0)`.

Iteration 2:
    - The number `-1` is processed. The variable `s` is updated by adding `1` (i.e., `-(-1)`), resulting in `s = 1`.
    - The condition `(s < 0)` is false, so `s` remains 1.
    - `max_sum` is updated to 1 as `max(s, max_sum)` is `max(1, 0)`.

After the loop, the condition `(max_sum == 0)` is false because `max_sum` is 1.
The `min_sum` is calculated as `-max_sum`, which results in `-1`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([1, -1])` is `-1`.
