The function `fruit_distribution` is called with the string "2 apples and 3 oranges" and the number 5.
Inside the function, an empty list `lis` is initialized.
The string is split by spaces into the list `['2', 'apples', 'and', '3', 'oranges']`.

Iteration 1:
    - The element '2' is a digit.
    - It is converted to integer and added to the list `lis`, making `lis = [2]`.
Iteration 2:
    - The element 'apples' is not a digit, so it is skipped.
Iteration 3:
    - The element 'and' is not a digit, so it is skipped.
Iteration 4:
    - The element '3' is a digit.
    - It is converted to integer and added to the list `lis`, making `lis = [2, 3]`.
Iteration 5:
    - The element 'oranges' is not a digit, so it is skipped.

After processing all elements, the list `lis` contains `[2, 3]`.
The sum of the list `lis` is `5`.
The function returns `n - sum(lis)`, which is `5 - 5 = 0`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 5)` is 0.
