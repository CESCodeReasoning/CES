The function `multiply` takes two integers, `a` and `b`, as input. It calculates the product of the last digits of both integers. The last digit of an integer can be obtained using the modulus operation with 10. The function uses `abs` to ensure that the result is non-negative, even if the input numbers are negative.

For the input values `a = 76` and `b = 67`:
1. The last digit of `76` is `76 % 10 = 6`.
2. The last digit of `67` is `67 % 10 = 7`.
3. The product of these last digits is `6 * 7 = 42`.

Thus, the output of the function `multiply` when called with arguments `76` and `67` is `42`.
