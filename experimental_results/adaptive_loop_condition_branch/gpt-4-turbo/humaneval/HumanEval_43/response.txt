[REASONING]
The function `pairs_sum_to_zero(l)` takes a list `l` as its parameter. The function iterates through each element in the list using a nested loop to check if any two distinct elements sum to zero.

First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, `l1` is 1 (the first element of the list).
    - The inner loop `j` iterates from 1 to 3 (length of the list minus one).
    - `l1 + l[j]` values are:
        - When j = 1 (l[j]=3), the sum is 4, which is not zero.
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=5), the sum is 6, which is not zero.
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=0), the sum is 1, which is not zero.

Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, `l1` is 3 (the second element of the list).
    - The inner loop `j` iterates from 2 to 3.
    - `l1 + l[j]` values are:
        - When j = 2 (l[j]=5), the sum is 8, which is not zero.
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=0), the sum is 3, which is not zero.

Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, `l1` is 5 (the third element of the list).
    - The inner loop `j` iterates from 3 to 3.
    - `l1 + l[j]` values are:
        - When j = 3 (l[j]=0), the sum is 5, which is not zero.

Fourth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, `l1` is 0 (the fourth element of the list).
    - There are no more elements to compare with, so the inner loop does not execute.

Since no pairs sum to zero, the function returns `False`.
