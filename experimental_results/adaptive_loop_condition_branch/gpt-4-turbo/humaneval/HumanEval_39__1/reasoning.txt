The function `prime_fib` is called with `n = 4`. The function generates Fibonacci numbers and checks if each number is a prime. If it is a prime, it decrements `n` until `n` becomes 0, at which point it returns the last generated Fibonacci number.

1. Initialize the Fibonacci sequence with `f = [0, 1]`.
2. Enter a loop to generate the next Fibonacci number by summing the last two numbers in the list `f`.
3. Check if the newly generated Fibonacci number is prime using the `is_prime` function.
4. If the number is prime, decrement `n`.
5. If `n` becomes 0, return the last Fibonacci number.

The Fibonacci sequence starts as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
The prime numbers in this sequence are 2, 3, 5, 13, ...

Step-by-step:
- 0 and 1 are not prime.
- The next number, 1, is not prime.
- The next number, 2, is prime (n decrements to 3).
- The next number, 3, is prime (n decrements to 2).
- The next number, 5, is prime (n decrements to 1).
- The next number, 8, is not prime.
- The next number, 13, is prime (n decrements to 0).

At this point, since `n` is 0, the function returns the last Fibonacci number, which is 13.
