[REASONING]
The function `monotonic` is called with the list `[1, 2, 4, 10]`.
The function checks if the list is either non-decreasing or non-increasing.
- The list `[1, 2, 4, 10]` is compared with its sorted version, which is `[1, 2, 4, 10]`. Since they are the same, the list is non-decreasing.
- The list `[1, 2, 4, 10]` is also compared with its reverse sorted version, which is `[10, 4, 2, 1]`. They are not the same, so the list is not non-increasing.
Since the list matches its sorted version, the condition `(l == sorted(l) or l == sorted(l, reverse=True))` evaluates to True.
Therefore, the function returns True, indicating that the list is monotonic.

Therefore, the final output of the function `monotonic([1, 2, 4, 10])` is True.
