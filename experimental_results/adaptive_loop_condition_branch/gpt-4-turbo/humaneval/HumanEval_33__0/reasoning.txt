The function `sort_third` takes a list `l` as input. The function first creates a copy of the list to avoid modifying the original list directly. It then sorts every third element of the list, starting from the first element (index 0). The sorted elements replace the original third elements in the list. The function returns the modified list.

To understand the execution:
1. The input list is `[5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]`.
2. The third elements (every third starting from index 0) are extracted: `[5, 2, 9, 1]`.
3. These extracted elements are sorted: `[1, 2, 5, 9]`.
4. The sorted elements replace the original positions of the third elements in the list: `[1, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 5, 0, 123, 9, -10]`.
5. The modified list is returned.

Thus, the output of the function when called with the given input is `[1, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 5, 0, 123, 9, -10]`.
