The function `triangle_area` is called with the sides of a triangle: a = 1, b = 2, and c = 10.
The function first checks if the given sides can form a triangle using the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.
Here, the conditions checked are:
- a + b <= c (1 + 2 <= 10) which is True,
- a + c <= b (1 + 10 <= 2) which is False,
- b + c <= a (2 + 10 <= 1) which is False.

Since one of the conditions (a + b <= c) is True, the function concludes that the sides cannot form a triangle. Therefore, the function returns -1 immediately without calculating the area.

Thus, the output of the function `triangle_area(1, 2, 10)` is -1.
