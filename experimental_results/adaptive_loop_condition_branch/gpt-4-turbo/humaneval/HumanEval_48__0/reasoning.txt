The function `is_palindrome` is called with the input string 'xywzx'.
The function checks if the input string is a palindrome by comparing characters symmetrically from the start and end towards the center.

Iteration 1:
   - `i` is 0, comparing `text[0]` ('x') with `text[4]` ('x'). They are equal.
Iteration 2:
   - `i` is 1, comparing `text[1]` ('y') with `text[3]` ('z'). They are not equal, so the function returns `False` immediately.

Since a mismatch is found in the second iteration, the function does not proceed further and returns `False`, indicating that the string 'xywzx' is not a palindrome.
