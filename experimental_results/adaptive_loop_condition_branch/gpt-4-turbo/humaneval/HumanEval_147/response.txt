The function `get_max_triples(n)` is designed to find all unique triples `(A[i], A[j], A[k])` from a list `A` where the sum of the elements in each triple is divisible by 3. The list `A` is generated using the formula `i*i - i + 1` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.

For `n=5`, the list `A` is computed as follows:
- For `i=1`: `1*1 - 1 + 1 = 1`
- For `i=2`: `2*2 - 2 + 1 = 3`
- For `i=3`: `3*3 - 3 + 1 = 7`
- For `i=4`: `4*4 - 4 + 1 = 13`
- For `i=5`: `5*5 - 5 + 1 = 21`
Thus, `A = [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]`.

The function then uses three nested loops to iterate over all possible triples `(i, j, k)` where `i < j < k`. For each triple, it checks if the sum of the corresponding elements from `A` is divisible by 3.

Here's the breakdown of the iterations:
- For `i=0` (A[i]=1):
  - `j=1` (A[j]=3):
    - `k=2` (A[k]=7): Sum = 1+3+7 = 11 (not divisible by 3)
    - `k=3` (A[k]=13): Sum = 1+3+13 = 17 (not divisible by 3)
    - `k=4` (A[k]=21): Sum = 1+3+21 = 25 (not divisible by 3)
  - `j=2` (A[j]=7):
    - `k=3` (A[k]=13): Sum = 1+7+13 = 21 (divisible by 3)
    - `k=4` (A[k]=21): Sum = 1+7+21 = 29 (not divisible by 3)
  - `j=3` (A[j]=13):
    - `k=4` (A[k]=21): Sum = 1+13+21 = 35 (not divisible by 3)
- For `i=1` (A[i]=3):
  - `j=2` (A[j]=7):
    - `k=3` (A[k]=13): Sum = 3+7+13 = 23 (not divisible by 3)
    - `k=4` (A[k]=21): Sum = 3+7+21 = 31 (not divisible by 3)
  - `j=3` (A[j]=13):
    - `k=4` (A[k]=21): Sum = 3+13+21 = 37 (not divisible by 3)
- For `i=2` (A[i]=7):
  - `j=3` (A[j]=13):
    - `k=4` (A[k]=21): Sum = 7+13+21 = 41 (not divisible by 3)

Only one triple `(1, 7, 13)` has a sum divisible by 3. Thus, the function returns 1.
