The function `is_palindrome` is called with the string 'jerry'.
1. The function first checks if the input string is empty. Since 'jerry' is not empty, the condition `(not string)` evaluates to `False`, and the corresponding branch is not taken.
2. The variable `beginning_of_suffix` is initialized to 0.
3. The function enters a while loop that continues until `string[beginning_of_suffix:]` is a palindrome.
   - First Iteration (`beginning_of_suffix = 0`):
     - The substring is 'jerry', which is not a palindrome, so `beginning_of_suffix` is incremented to 1.
   - Second Iteration (`beginning_of_suffix = 1`):
     - The substring is 'erry', which is not a palindrome, so `beginning_of_suffix` is incremented to 2.
   - Third Iteration (`beginning_of_suffix = 2`):
     - The substring is 'rry', which is not a palindrome, so `beginning_of_suffix` is incremented to 3.
   - Fourth Iteration (`beginning_of_suffix = 3`):
     - The substring is 'ry', which is not a palindrome, so `beginning_of_suffix` is incremented to 4.
   - Fifth Iteration (`beginning_of_suffix = 4`):
     - The substring is 'y', which is a palindrome, so the loop exits.
4. The function returns the original string concatenated with the reverse of the substring from the beginning of the string up to `beginning_of_suffix` (exclusive). This results in 'jerry' + 'rrej' = 'jerryrrej'.
