The function `exchange` is called with `lst1 = [100, 200]` and `lst2 = [200, 200]`.
Inside the function, two variables `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

First loop (iterating over `lst1`):
- First Iteration (i = 100):
  - `i % 2 == 1` evaluates to False (100 is even).
  - The branch is not taken.
- Second Iteration (i = 200):
  - `i % 2 == 1` evaluates to False (200 is even).
  - The branch is not taken.
- `odd` remains 0 after the loop.

Second loop (iterating over `lst2`):
- First Iteration (i = 200):
  - `i % 2 == 0` evaluates to True (200 is even).
  - The branch is taken and `even` is incremented to 1.
- Second Iteration (i = 200):
  - `i % 2 == 0` evaluates to True (200 is even).
  - The branch is taken and `even` is incremented to 2.
- `even` is 2 after the loop.

Final conditional check:
- `even >= odd` evaluates to True (2 >= 0).
- The branch is taken and "YES" is returned.

Therefore, the function returns "YES".
