The function `will_it_fly` is called with the arguments `q = [1, 2, 3]` and `w = 6`.
1. The function first checks if the sum of the list `q` is greater than `w`. The sum of `q` is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is equal to `w`, not greater. Therefore, the condition `sum(q) > w` is `False`, and the first branch is not taken.
2. The function initializes two pointers, `i` at the start of the list (`0`) and `j` at the end of the list (`2`).
3. The while loop condition `i < j` is checked. Since `0 < 2` is `True`, the loop proceeds.
4. Inside the loop, the function checks if `q[i]` is not equal to `q[j]`. For the first iteration, `q[0]` is `1` and `q[2]` is `3`, which are not equal. Therefore, the condition `q[i] != q[j]` is `True`, and the second branch is taken, returning `False`.
5. The loop exits early due to the return statement, and the function does not proceed to check the other elements or further iterations.

Thus, the function returns `False` because the list `q` is not a palindrome.
