The function `get_odd_collatz` is called with `n = 5`.
1. The initial check `(n % 2 == 0)` evaluates to `False` because 5 is odd. Therefore, the first branch is not taken, and the second branch initializes `odd_collatz` with `[5]`.
2. The while loop condition `(n > 1)` is `True` since `n = 5`.
3. Inside the loop, since `n` is odd `(n % 2 == 0)` evaluates to `False`, so `n` is updated to `n * 3 + 1 = 16`.
4. In the next iteration, `n = 16` (even), so `(n % 2 == 0)` is `True`. `n` is updated to `n / 2 = 8`.
5. Next, `n = 8` (even), so `n` is updated to `n / 2 = 4`.
6. Next, `n = 4` (even), so `n` is updated to `n / 2 = 2`.
7. Next, `n = 2` (even), so `n` is updated to `n / 2 = 1`.
8. Finally, `n = 1` (odd), and since `(n % 2 == 1)` is `True`, `1` is added to `odd_collatz`.
9. The loop ends as `n` becomes `1`, which is not greater than `1`.
10. The list `odd_collatz` now contains `[5, 1]` and is returned sorted as `[1, 5]`.
