The function `sort_numbers` takes a string of number words separated by spaces and returns a string of these number words sorted according to their numeric values. The mapping of number words to their numeric values is provided in the dictionary `value_map`.

1. The input string is empty ('').
2. The `numbers.split(' ')` method splits the input string by spaces. Since the input is empty, this results in a list containing an empty string: `['']`.
3. The list comprehension `[x for x in numbers.split(' ') if x]` filters out any empty strings from the split result. Since the only element is an empty string, the list comprehension returns an empty list: `[]`.
4. The `sorted` function is called with this empty list and a key function that would look up each word in the `value_map` dictionary to get its numeric value. However, since the list is empty, `sorted` also returns an empty list.
5. The `join` method concatenates the elements of the sorted list (which are still empty) into a single string separated by spaces. Since the list is empty, the result is an empty string.
6. The function returns this empty string.

Thus, the output of executing the function `sort_numbers` on the input '' is an empty string.
