The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with the input string '(()(())((())))'.
The function is designed to separate groups of balanced parentheses into individual strings.

1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the groups of balanced parentheses.
2. Initialize an empty list `current_string` to build the current group of balanced parentheses.
3. Initialize `current_depth` to 0 to keep track of the depth of nested parentheses.

The function iterates over each character `c` in the input string:
- For each '(': 
  - Increment `current_depth` by 1.
  - Append '(' to `current_string`.
- For each ')':
  - Decrement `current_depth` by 1.
  - Append ')' to `current_string`.
  - If `current_depth` becomes 0 after appending, it means a balanced group is completed:
    - Append the joined `current_string` to `result`.
    - Clear `current_string` to start a new group.

The loop processes the characters as follows:
- '(' increases depth to 1, starts new group.
- ')' decreases depth to 0, completes group '()'.
- '(' increases depth to 1, starts new group.
- '(' increases depth to 2.
- ')' decreases depth to 1.
- ')' decreases depth to 0, completes group '(())'.
- '(' increases depth to 1, starts new group.
- '(' increases depth to 2.
- '(' increases depth to 3.
- ')' decreases depth to 2.
- ')' decreases depth to 1.
- ')' decreases depth to 0, completes group '((()))'.

Finally, the function returns the list `result` containing the separated groups of balanced parentheses.
