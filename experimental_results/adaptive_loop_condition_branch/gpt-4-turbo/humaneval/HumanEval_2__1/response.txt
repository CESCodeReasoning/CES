[REASONING]
The function `truncate_number` takes a floating-point number as input and returns the fractional part of the number by using the modulus operator with 1.0. The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of the division of the number by 1.0.
For the input 1.33, the integer part is 1 and the fractional part is 0.33. When 1.33 is divided by 1.0, the remainder is 0.33.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `truncate_number` on the input 1.33 is 0.33.

[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    # [STATE] number = 1.33 [/STATE]
    return number % 1.0  # [STATE] return value = 0.33 [/STATE]
[/PYTHON]

[OUTPUT]
0.33
