The function `factorize` is called with the argument `n = 3 * 2 * 3 = 18`.
The function aims to factorize the number 18 into its prime factors.

1. Initialize an empty list `fact` to store factors.
2. Start with `i = 2` and iterate while `i <= int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`.
   - `math.sqrt(18) â‰ˆ 4.24`, so `int(math.sqrt(18) + 1) = 5`.
3. First Iteration (`i = 2`):
   - `18 % 2 == 0` is true. Append `2` to `fact` and update `n` to `18 // 2 = 9`.
   - The condition is true, so the branch is taken.
4. Second Iteration (`i = 2`):
   - `9 % 2 == 0` is false. Increment `i` to `3`.
   - The condition is false, so the else branch is taken.
5. Third Iteration (`i = 3`):
   - `9 % 3 == 0` is true. Append `3` to `fact` and update `n` to `9 // 3 = 3`.
   - The condition is true, so the branch is taken.
6. Fourth Iteration (`i = 3`):
   - `3 % 3 == 0` is true. Append `3` to `fact` and update `n` to `3 // 3 = 1`.
   - The condition is true, so the branch is taken.
7. Fifth Iteration (`i = 3`):
   - Increment `i` to `4` since `1 % 3 == 0` is false.
   - The condition is false, so the else branch is taken.
8. Sixth Iteration (`i = 4`):
   - `i` is now greater than `int(math.sqrt(1) + 1) = 2`, so the loop exits.
9. Check if `n > 1`:
   - `n = 1` is not greater than 1, so the branch is not taken.
10. Return the list `fact` which now contains `[2, 3, 3]`.
