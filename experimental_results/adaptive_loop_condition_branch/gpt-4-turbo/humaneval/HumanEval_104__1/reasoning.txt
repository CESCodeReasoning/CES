The function `unique_digits` is called with the list `[12345, 2033, 111, 151]`.
Inside the function, an empty list `odd_digit_elements` is initialized to store numbers that consist entirely of odd digits.

Iteration 1:
    - The number `12345` is checked. It contains the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The digit 2 and 4 are even, so it does not satisfy the condition of all digits being odd.
Iteration 2:
    - The number `2033` is checked. It contains the digits 2, 0, 3, 3. The digits 2 and 0 are even, so it does not satisfy the condition.
Iteration 3:
    - The number `111` is checked. It contains the digits 1, 1, 1. All digits are odd, so it satisfies the condition and is added to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 4:
    - The number `151` is checked. It contains the digits 1, 5, 1. All digits are odd, so it satisfies the condition and is added to `odd_digit_elements`.

After all iterations, the `odd_digit_elements` list contains `[111, 151]`. This list is then sorted (though it is already in order) and returned.

Therefore, the final output of the function `unique_digits([12345, 2033, 111, 151])` is `[111, 151]`.
