The function `below_threshold` is called with the list `l = [1, 20, 4, 10]` and the threshold `t = 21`.
Inside the function, a loop iterates through each element `e` of the list `l`.

Iteration 1:
   - The element `e` is 1, which is less than `t` (21).
   - The condition `e >= t` is false.
   - The loop continues to the next element.

Iteration 2:
   - The element `e` is 20, which is also less than `t` (21).
   - The condition `e >= t` is false.
   - The loop continues to the next element.

Iteration 3:
   - The element `e` is 4, which is less than `t` (21).
   - The condition `e >= t` is false.
   - The loop continues to the next element.

Iteration 4:
   - The element `e` is 10, which is less than `t` (21).
   - The condition `e >= t` is false.
   - The loop continues, but there are no more elements.

Since no element in the list `l` is greater than or equal to `t`, the loop completes without returning `False`. Therefore, the function returns `True` indicating that all elements in the list are below the threshold `t`.
