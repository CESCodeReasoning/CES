The function `can_arrange` is called with the array `[4, 8, 5, 7, 3]`.
Inside the function, a variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = 4` (since the length of the array is 5).

First Iteration (i = 1):
    - The condition `i < len(arr)` is true when `i = 1` and `len(arr) = 5`.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false because `arr[1] = 8` is not less than `arr[0] = 4`.
    - The branch is not taken, and `ind` remains -1.

Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - The condition `i < len(arr)` is true when `i = 2`.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true because `arr[2] = 5` is less than `arr[1] = 8`.
    - The branch is taken, and `ind` is updated to 2.

Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - The condition `i < len(arr)` is true when `i = 3`.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false because `arr[3] = 7` is not less than `arr[2] = 5`.
    - The branch is not taken, and `ind` remains 2.

Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    - The condition `i < len(arr)` is true when `i = 4`.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true because `arr[4] = 3` is less than `arr[3] = 7`.
    - The branch is taken, and `ind` is updated to 4.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is now 4.
