The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with `n = 9`.
Inside the function, two counters `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.

The loop iterates from 1 through 9 (since `n = 9`).

First Iteration (i = 1):
   - `i` is 1, which is odd and a palindrome.
   - The condition `(i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i))` is true.
   - Action: `odd_palindrome_count` is incremented by 1.

Second Iteration (i = 2):
   - `i` is 2, which is even and a palindrome.
   - The condition `(i % 2 == 0 and is_palindrome(i))` is true.
   - Action: `even_palindrome_count` is incremented by 1.

Third Iteration (i = 3):
   - `i` is 3, which is odd and a palindrome.
   - The condition `(i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i))` is true.
   - Action: `odd_palindrome_count` is incremented by 1.

Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
   - `i` is 4, which is even but not a palindrome.
   - No conditions are met.

Fifth Iteration (i = 5):
   - `i` is 5, which is odd and a palindrome.
   - The condition `(i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i))` is true.
   - Action: `odd_palindrome_count` is incremented by 1.

Sixth Iteration (i = 6):
   - `i` is 6, which is even but not a palindrome.
   - No conditions are met.

Seventh Iteration (i = 7):
   - `i` is 7, which is odd and a palindrome.
   - The condition `(i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i))` is true.
   - Action: `odd_palindrome_count` is incremented by 1.

Eighth Iteration (i = 8):
   - `i` is 8, which is even but not a palindrome.
   - No conditions are met.

Ninth Iteration (i = 9):
   - `i` is 9, which is odd and a palindrome.
   - The condition `(i % 2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i))` is true.
   - Action: `odd_palindrome_count` is incremented by 1.

Return Statement:
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the tuple `(even_palindrome_count, odd_palindrome_count)`, which is now `(1, 5)`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_palindrome(9)` is `(1, 5)`.
