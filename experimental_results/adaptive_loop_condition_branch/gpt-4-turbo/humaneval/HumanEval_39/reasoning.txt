The function `prime_fib` is called with `n = 1`. The goal is to find the first prime number in the Fibonacci sequence.

1. The Fibonacci sequence is initialized with `f = [0, 1]`.
2. The function enters a loop where it continuously appends the sum of the last two elements of the list `f` to itself, thus generating the next Fibonacci number.
3. After each new Fibonacci number is generated, the function `is_prime` is called to check if this number is prime.
4. The `is_prime` function first checks if the number `p` is less than 2. If true, it returns `False` (not prime).
5. If `p` is greater than or equal to 2, it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `p`. If any number divides `p` without a remainder, `p` is not prime, and `False` is returned. If no divisors are found, `True` is returned (prime).
6. Back in the `prime_fib` function, if a prime Fibonacci number is found (`is_prime(f[-1])` returns `True`), `n` is decremented by 1.
7. The loop continues until `n` equals 0, at which point the last Fibonacci number (which is prime) is returned.

For `n = 1`, the function will find the first prime number in the Fibonacci sequence:
- Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
- Prime checks: 0 (not prime), 1 (not prime), 1 (not prime), 2 (prime).
- The first prime number found is 2, and `n` becomes 0, so 2 is returned.
