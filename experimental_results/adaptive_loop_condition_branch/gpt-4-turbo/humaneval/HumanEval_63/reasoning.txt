The function `fibfib` is called with ( n = 2 ).
The function checks if `n` is 0, 1, or 2 through a series of conditional statements:
1. The first condition checks if `n == 0`. Since `n` is 2, this condition is false.
2. The second condition checks if `n == 1`. Since `n` is 2, this condition is also false.
3. The third condition checks if `n == 2`. Since `n` is indeed 2, this condition is true.

Since the condition `n == 2` is true, the function returns 1 without further recursive calls.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fibfib(2)` is 1.
