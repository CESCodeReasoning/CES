The function `prod_signs` is called with the list `[1, 2, 2, -4]`.
1. The function first checks if the list `arr` is empty. Since `arr` is not empty, the condition `(not arr)` evaluates to `False`, and the corresponding branch is not taken.
2. Next, the function checks if `0` is in the list `arr`. Since `0` is not present, the product `prod` is calculated as `(-1) ** len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr)))`. Here, the filter function counts how many numbers in the list are negative. In this case, there is one negative number (`-4`), so the length of the filtered list is `1`. Therefore, `(-1) ** 1` equals `-1`.
3. The function then calculates the sum of the absolute values of the elements in `arr`. The absolute values are `[1, 2, 2, 4]`, and their sum is `9`.
4. Finally, the function returns the product of `prod` and the sum of absolute values, which is `-1 * 9 = -9`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4])` is `-9`.
