The function `strange_sort_list` is called with the input list containing a single element, `[111111]`.
Inside the function:
- `res` is initialized as an empty list.
- `switch` is initialized as `True`.

First Iteration:
- `lst` is `[111111]`.
- Since `switch` is `True`, the function appends the minimum value of `lst` to `res`. The minimum (and only) value is `111111`.
- `res` is updated to `[111111]`.
- The value `111111` is then removed from `lst`, making `lst` empty (`[]`).
- `switch` is toggled to `False`.

The while loop condition (`lst`) is now `False` because `lst` is empty. The loop terminates.

The function returns the list `res`, which contains `[111111]`.
