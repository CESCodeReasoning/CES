The function `compare` takes two lists, `game` and `guess`, as inputs. It returns a list of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists. The function uses list comprehension to achieve this, iterating over pairs of elements from `game` and `guess` using the `zip` function. For each pair `(x, y)`, it calculates the absolute difference `abs(x - y)` and collects these differences into a new list.

In this specific case, both input lists are `[0,0,0,0,0,0]`. Therefore, the differences between corresponding elements of `game` and `guess` will all be `0` because each element in `game` is exactly the same as the corresponding element in `guess`. The resulting list will thus be `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
