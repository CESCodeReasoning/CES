The function `skjkasdkd` is called with the list `[127, 97, 8192]`.
Inside the function:
- A nested function `isPrime(n)` is defined to check if a number `n` is prime.
- A variable `maxx` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the maximum prime number found in the list.
- A variable `i` is initialized to 0 to iterate through the list.

Iteration 1 (i = 0, lst[i] = 127):
- Check if 127 is prime:
  - No divisors found from 2 to 11 (sqrt(127) + 1), so 127 is prime.
- Since 127 > 0 and is prime, `maxx` is updated to 127.
- Increment `i` to 1.

Iteration 2 (i = 1, lst[i] = 97):
- Check if 97 is prime:
  - No divisors found from 2 to 10 (sqrt(97) + 1), so 97 is prime.
- Since 97 < 127, `maxx` remains 127.
- Increment `i` to 2.

Iteration 3 (i = 2, lst[i] = 8192):
- Check if 8192 is prime:
  - 8192 is divisible by 2, so it is not prime.
- Since 8192 is not prime, `maxx` remains 127.
- Increment `i` to 3, which ends the loop as `i` is now equal to `len(lst)`.

Finally, the function calculates the sum of the digits of `maxx` (127), which is 1 + 2 + 7 = 10.

Therefore, the function returns 10.
