The function `fibfib` is called with ( n = 10 ).
This function is a variation of the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the previous three terms instead of two. The base cases are:
- `fibfib(0)` returns 0.
- `fibfib(1)` returns 0.
- `fibfib(2)` returns 1.

For `n = 10`, the function does not match any of the base cases directly, so it proceeds to recursively calculate:
- `fibfib(9)`, `fibfib(8)`, and `fibfib(7)` and sums their results.
- This pattern continues, breaking down each function call into smaller subproblems until the base cases are reached.

The recursive breakdown continues until all values are computed based on the base cases and summed up to give the final result for `fibfib(10)`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fibfib(10)` is the sum of the results of `fibfib(9)`, `fibfib(8)`, and `fibfib(7)`, each of which is similarly computed.
