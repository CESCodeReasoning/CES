The function `digits` is called with the argument `n = 5576543`.
Inside the function:
- A variable `product` is initialized to 1.
- A variable `odd_count` is initialized to 0.
- The number `n` is converted to a string to iterate over each digit.

Iteration over each digit of `5576543`:
1. First digit '5':
   - It is odd (`5 % 2 == 1`).
   - `product` is updated to `1 * 5 = 5`.
   - `odd_count` is incremented to 1.
2. Second digit '5':
   - It is odd.
   - `product` is updated to `5 * 5 = 25`.
   - `odd_count` is incremented to 2.
3. Third digit '7':
   - It is odd.
   - `product` is updated to `25 * 7 = 175`.
   - `odd_count` is incremented to 3.
4. Fourth digit '6':
   - It is even (`6 % 2 == 0`).
   - `product` and `odd_count` remain unchanged.
5. Fifth digit '5':
   - It is odd.
   - `product` is updated to `175 * 5 = 875`.
   - `odd_count` is incremented to 4.
6. Sixth digit '4':
   - It is even.
   - `product` and `odd_count` remain unchanged.
7. Seventh digit '3':
   - It is odd.
   - `product` is updated to `875 * 3 = 2625`.
   - `odd_count` is incremented to 5.

After the loop:
- The `odd_count` is 5, which is not zero.
- The function returns the `product`, which is 2625.

Therefore, the output of the function `digits(5576543)` is 2625.
