The function `valid_date` is called with the string '03-11-2000'.
1. The string is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, though there are none in this case.
2. The date string is split into three parts: '03', '11', '2000', which represent the month, day, and year respectively.
3. These string representations are converted to integers: month = 3, day = 11, year = 2000.
4. The function then checks if the month is valid (i.e., between 1 and 12). Since month = 3, it is valid.
5. Next, it checks if the day is valid for the given month:
   - For months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, the days should be between 1 and 31. Since March (month 3) is in this list and day = 11, it is valid.
   - The function does not proceed to check the conditions for months with 30 days or February since the month is already identified as March.
6. No exceptions are raised during the execution, so the function returns True, indicating that '03-11-2000' is a valid date.
