The function `triangle_area` is called with the sides of a triangle: a = 3, b = 4, c = 5.
The function first checks if the given sides can form a triangle using the triangle inequality theorem:
   - a + b > c
   - a + c > b
   - b + c > a
For the given sides:
   - 3 + 4 = 7 which is greater than 5
   - 3 + 5 = 8 which is greater than 4
   - 4 + 5 = 9 which is greater than 3
All conditions are satisfied, so the sides can form a triangle.

The function then calculates the semi-perimeter (s) of the triangle:
   - s = (a + b + c) / 2 = (3 + 4 + 5) / 2 = 6

Using Heron's formula, the area of the triangle is calculated:
   - area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) = sqrt(6 * (6 - 3) * (6 - 4) * (6 - 5)) = sqrt(6 * 3 * 2 * 1) = sqrt(36) = 6

The area is then rounded to two decimal places, resulting in an area of 6.00.

Therefore, the final output of the function `triangle_area(3, 4, 5)` is 6.00.
