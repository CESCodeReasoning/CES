[REASONING]
The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` checks if a given integer `n` is both even and greater than or equal to 8. The function uses a logical AND operator to combine two conditions: `n % 2 == 0` checks if `n` is even, and `n >= 8` checks if `n` is at least 8.

For the input 6:
1. The condition `n % 2 == 0` checks if 6 is even. Since 6 divided by 2 gives a remainder of 0, this condition is true.
2. The condition `n >= 8` checks if 6 is greater than or equal to 8. Since 6 is less than 8, this condition is false.

Since one of the conditions is false, the overall result of the AND operation is false. Therefore, the function returns `False` for the input 6.

[ANSWER]
```python
from typing import *

def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    # [STATE] n = 6 [/STATE]
    # [CONDITION] n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8 [/CONDITION]
    # [BRANCH] Y, N [/BRANCH]
    return n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8
```
