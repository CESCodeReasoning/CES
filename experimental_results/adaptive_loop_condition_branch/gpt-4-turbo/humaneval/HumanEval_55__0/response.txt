[REASONING]
The function `fib` is called with `n = 12`.
This function calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

1. The function first checks if `n == 0`. Since `n` is 12, this condition is false.
2. Next, it checks if `n == 1`. Since `n` is 12, this condition is also false.
3. Since neither condition is met, the function proceeds to calculate `fib(12)` using the formula `fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)`.
4. This results in recursive calls to `fib(11)` and `fib(10)`.
5. Each of these calls further breaks down into more recursive calls until the base cases (`n == 0` or `n == 1`) are reached.
6. The results of these base cases are then added up following the recursive call stack to finally compute `fib(12)`.

The Fibonacci sequence starts with `fib(0) = 0`, `fib(1) = 1`, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Thus, `fib(12)` is calculated as 144.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fib(12)` is 144.
