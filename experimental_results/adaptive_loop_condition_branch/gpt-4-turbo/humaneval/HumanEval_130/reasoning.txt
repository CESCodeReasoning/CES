The function `tri` is called with `n = 3`.
1. The function first checks if `n` is 0. Since `n` is 3, this condition is false.
2. The list `my_tri` is initialized with `[1, 3]`.
3. The loop iterates from 2 through 3 (since `n = 3`).
   - First Iteration (i = 2):
     - `i % 2 == 0` is true (2 is even).
     - The value `i / 2 + 1` equals `2 / 2 + 1 = 2`.
     - `my_tri` is updated to `[1, 3, 2]`.
   - Second Iteration (i = 3):
     - `i % 2 == 0` is false (3 is odd).
     - The value `my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2` equals `my_tri[2] + my_tri[1] + (3 + 3) / 2 = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8`.
     - `my_tri` is updated to `[1, 3, 2, 8]`.
4. The function returns the list `my_tri` which is `[1, 3, 2, 8]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `tri(3)` is `[1, 3, 2, 8]`.
