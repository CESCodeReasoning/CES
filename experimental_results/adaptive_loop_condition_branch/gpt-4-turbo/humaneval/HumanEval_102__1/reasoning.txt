The function `choose_num` is called with parameters (x = 33, y = 12354).
1. The first condition checks if `x > y`. Since 33 is not greater than 12354, this condition is false.
2. The second condition checks if `y % 2 == 0`. Since 12354 modulo 2 equals 0, this condition is true.
3. Because the second condition is true, the function returns `y`, which is 12354. The subsequent conditions are not evaluated because the function has already returned a value.

Therefore, the final output of the function `choose_num(33, 12354)` is 12354.
