The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` checks if a given integer `n` is both even and greater than or equal to 8. The function uses a logical AND operator to combine two conditions:
1. `n % 2 == 0` checks if `n` is even.
2. `n >= 8` checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 8.

For the input `4`, the function evaluates the conditions as follows:
- `4 % 2 == 0` evaluates to `True` because 4 is even.
- `4 >= 8` evaluates to `False` because 4 is less than 8.

Since the second condition fails, the overall result of the AND operation is `False`. Therefore, the function returns `False` for the input `4`.
