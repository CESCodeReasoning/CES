The function `hex_key` is called with the string "123456789ABCDEF0".
Inside the function, a tuple `primes` contains the characters '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D', which are considered prime in this context.
A variable `total` is initialized to 0 to count the occurrences of these prime characters in the input string.

The loop iterates over each character in the string "123456789ABCDEF0", which has a length of 16.

Iteration 1:
   - Character '1' is not in `primes`.
Iteration 2:
   - Character '2' is in `primes`, so `total` becomes 1.
Iteration 3:
   - Character '3' is in `primes`, so `total` becomes 2.
Iteration 4:
   - Character '4' is not in `primes`.
Iteration 5:
   - Character '5' is in `primes`, so `total` becomes 3.
Iteration 6:
   - Character '6' is not in `primes`.
Iteration 7:
   - Character '7' is in `primes`, so `total` becomes 4.
Iteration 8:
   - Character '8' is not in `primes`.
Iteration 9:
   - Character '9' is not in `primes`.
Iteration 10:
   - Character 'A' is not in `primes`.
Iteration 11:
   - Character 'B' is in `primes`, so `total` becomes 5.
Iteration 12:
   - Character 'C' is not in `primes`.
Iteration 13:
   - Character 'D' is in `primes`, so `total` becomes 6.
Iteration 14:
   - Character 'E' is not in `primes`.
Iteration 15:
   - Character 'F' is not in `primes`.
Iteration 16:
   - Character '0' is not in `primes`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `total`, which is 6, representing the count of prime characters in the input string.
