The function `truncate_number` takes a floating-point number as input and returns the fractional part of the number by using the modulo operation with 1.0. The modulo operation `%` calculates the remainder of the division of the number by 1.0, which effectively isolates the decimal part of the number.
For the input 123.456, the integer part is 123 and the fractional part is 0.456. When we perform `123.456 % 1.0`, it returns the remainder after dividing 123.456 by 1.0, which is 0.456.
Thus, the output of executing the function `truncate_number` on the input 123.456 is 0.456.
