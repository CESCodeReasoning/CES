The function `match_parens` is called with the list `['()(', ')']`.
Inside the function:
1. The function concatenates the first and second elements of the list to form `S1 = '()()'`.
2. It then concatenates the second and first elements to form `S2 = ')()('`.

For `S1 = '()()'`:
- The function `check` is called with `s = '()()'`.
- Iteration over each character in `s`:
  - For '(': `val` is incremented by 1.
  - For ')': `val` is decremented by 1.
  - For '(': `val` is incremented by 1.
  - For ')': `val` is decremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `val` equals 0, indicating that parentheses are balanced. The function returns `True`.

For `S2 = ')()('`:
- The function `check` is called with `s = ')()('`.
- Iteration over each character in `s`:
  - For ')': `val` is decremented by 1 (val becomes negative), immediately returning `False` as it indicates unbalanced parentheses.

Since `check(S1)` returns `True`, the function `match_parens` returns 'Yes', indicating that at least one combination of the list elements results in a string with balanced parentheses.
