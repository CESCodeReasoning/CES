The function `encode` takes a string `message` as input. The process involves several steps:
1. Define a string `vowels` containing all lowercase and uppercase vowels.
2. Create a dictionary `vowels_replace` where each vowel is mapped to a character that is two positions ahead in the ASCII table.
3. Convert the case of each character in the input `message` using the `swapcase()` method. This changes all uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa.
4. Iterate over each character in the swapped case message. If the character is a vowel (as per the `vowels_replace` dictionary), replace it with the corresponding mapped character. If it's not a vowel, keep it unchanged.
5. Join all characters to form the final encoded message.

For the input "I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE":
- After `swapcase()`, the message becomes "i dOnT kNoW wHaT To wRiTe".
- Each vowel in this swapped message is then replaced according to the `vowels_replace` dictionary:
  - 'i' becomes 'k'
  - 'o' becomes 'q'
  - 'e' becomes 'g'
  - 'a' becomes 'c'
  - 'u' becomes 'w'
  - 'I' becomes 'K'
  - 'O' becomes 'Q'
  - 'E' becomes 'G'
  - 'A' becomes 'C'
  - 'U' becomes 'W'
- Non-vowel characters remain unchanged.
- The final encoded message is "k dQnT kNqW wHcT Tq wRgTg".
