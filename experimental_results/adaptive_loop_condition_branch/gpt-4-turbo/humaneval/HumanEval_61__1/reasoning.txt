The function `correct_bracketing` is called with the input string containing a single opening bracket "(".
The function initializes a variable `depth` to 0, which is used to track the balance of brackets.

Iteration 1:
   - The character 'b' is '(', which matches the condition `b == "("`.
   - The condition `(b == "(")` is true.
   - The depth is incremented by 1, resulting in `depth = 1`.
   - The condition `(depth < 0)` is false since `depth` is 1.
   - The loop ends as there is only one character in the input string.

After the loop, the function checks if `depth == 0`. Since `depth` is 1, the condition is false.
The function returns `False`, indicating that the brackets are not correctly balanced because there is an unmatched opening bracket.

Therefore, the output of the function `correct_bracketing("(")` is `False`.
