The function `find_zero` is called with the polynomial coefficients `[5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10]`.
The function aims to find a root of the polynomial within the interval `[-1, 1]` initially.

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - `begin` is set to -1.0 and `end` is set to 1.0.

2. **First While Loop**:
   - The polynomial values at `begin` and `end` are calculated. If their product is positive, it implies that both values are either positive or negative, indicating no root between them.
   - The loop expands the search interval by doubling `begin` and `end` until a sign change is detected between the polynomial values at `begin` and `end`.

3. **Second While Loop**:
   - Once a sign change is detected, the interval `[begin, end]` likely contains a root.
   - The loop then narrows down this interval by repeatedly halving it (`center` is the midpoint of `begin` and `end`).
   - If the polynomial values at `center` and `begin` have the same sign (product > 0), `begin` is moved to `center`.
   - Otherwise, `end` is moved to `center`.
   - This process continues until the interval size is less than `1e-10`, ensuring precision.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the value of `begin`, which is an approximation of the root.

Given the complexity of the polynomial, the exact behavior and values during the iterations depend on the polynomial evaluation, which is not trivial to predict without computation. However, the logic ensures that the interval is narrowed down to a very small range where a root exists.
