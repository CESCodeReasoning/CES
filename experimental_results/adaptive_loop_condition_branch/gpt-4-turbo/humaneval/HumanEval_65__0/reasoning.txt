The function `circular_shift` is called with parameters `x = 97` and `shift = 8`.
1. The integer `x` is converted to a string `s`, resulting in `s = '97'`.
2. The length of `s` is calculated as `len(s) = 2`.
3. The condition `shift > len(s)` is evaluated. Since `shift = 8` and `len(s) = 2`, the condition `8 > 2` is true.
4. Because the condition is true, the function returns the reverse of the string `s`, which is `'79'`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(97, 8)` is `'79'`.
