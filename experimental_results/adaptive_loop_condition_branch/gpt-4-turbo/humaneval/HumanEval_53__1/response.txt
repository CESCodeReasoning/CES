[REASONING]
The function `add` is designed to take two integers, `x` and `y`, as input and return their sum.
To determine the output of executing the function `add` on the inputs `6` and `8`, we simply perform the addition of these two numbers.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `add` on the inputs `6` and `8` is `14`.
[REASONING]

[ANSWER]
```python
from typing import *

def add(x: int, y: int):
    # [STATE] x = 6, y = 8 [/STATE]
    return x + y  # [RETURN] 14 [/RETURN]
```
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
14
