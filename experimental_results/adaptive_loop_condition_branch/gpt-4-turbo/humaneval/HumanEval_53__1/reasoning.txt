The function `add` is designed to take two integers, `x` and `y`, as input and return their sum.
To determine the output of executing the function `add` on the inputs `6` and `8`, we simply perform the addition of these two numbers.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `add` on the inputs `6` and `8` is `14`.
