[REASONING]
The function `make_a_pile` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list. The list is generated using a list comprehension that iterates from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive). For each iteration index `i`, the expression `n + 2*i` is computed and added to the list. This expression effectively starts at `n` and increments by 2 for each subsequent element, creating a sequence that begins at `n` and increases by 2 each step for `n` steps.

For the input `n = 3`, the list comprehension will execute as follows:
- When `i = 0`, the expression evaluates to `3 + 2*0 = 3`.
- When `i = 1`, the expression evaluates to `3 + 2*1 = 5`.
- When `i = 2`, the expression evaluates to `3 + 2*2 = 7`.

Thus, the function will return the list `[3, 5, 7]`.

def make_a_pile(n: int) -> List[int]:
    # [STATE] n = 3 [/STATE]
    return [n + 2*i for i in range(n)]  # [STATE] n + 2*i = 3, 5, 7 for i = 0, 1, 2 respectively [/STATE]
