The function `sort_third` takes a list `l` as input. The function first creates a copy of the input list to avoid modifying the original list directly. This is done by using `list(l)`. The function then sorts every third element of the list, starting from the first element (index 0). This is achieved by slicing the list with `l[::3]` and assigning the sorted version of this slice back to the same slice. The sorting only affects every third element, leaving other elements unchanged. Finally, the modified list is returned.

For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the steps are as follows:
1. Copy the list: `l = [1, 2, 3]`
2. Extract every third element starting from index 0: `l[::3]` gives `[1]`
3. Sort this extracted list, which remains `[1]` since it contains only one element.
4. Assign the sorted list back to the original positions in `l`: `l[::3] = [1]`
5. The list remains `[1, 2, 3]` as there are no changes made by the sorting.
6. Return the list `[1, 2, 3]`.

Thus, the output for the input `[1, 2, 3]` is `[1, 2, 3]`.
