[REASONING]
The function `how_many_times` is called with the parameters (string = "john doe", substring = "john").
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of times the substring appears in the string.

The loop iterates from 0 to the length of the string minus the length of the substring plus one. This is calculated as follows:
- Length of "john doe" is 8.
- Length of "john" is 4.
- Thus, the loop iterates from 0 to (8 - 4 + 1) = 5.

Iteration 1 (i = 0):
   - The substring from index 0 to 4 in "john doe" is "john", which matches "john".
   - The condition `string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring` is true.
   - Action: `times` is incremented by 1, resulting in `times = 1`.

Iteration 2 (i = 1):
   - The substring from index 1 to 5 in "john doe" is "ohn ", which does not match "john".
   - The condition is false.

Iteration 3 (i = 2):
   - The substring from index 2 to 6 in "john doe" is "hn d", which does not match "john".
   - The condition is false.

Iteration 4 (i = 3):
   - The substring from index 3 to 7 in "john doe" is "n do", which does not match "john".
   - The condition is false.

Iteration 5 (i = 4):
   - The substring from index 4 to 8 in "john doe" is " doe", which does not match "john".
   - The condition is false.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `times`, which is 1, indicating the substring "john" appears once in "john doe".

Therefore, the final output of the function `how_many_times('john doe', 'john')` is 1.
