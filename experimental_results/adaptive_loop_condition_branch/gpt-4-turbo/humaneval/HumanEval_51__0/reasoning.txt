The function `remove_vowels` is designed to take a string `text` as input and return a new string that excludes all vowels from the input string. The vowels considered are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and their uppercase versions. This is achieved by converting each character in `text` to lowercase and checking if it is not in the list of vowels. If the character is not a vowel, it is included in the output string.

In this specific case, the input to the function is an empty string (''). When the function processes an empty string, the list comprehension iterates over the string, which contains no characters. Therefore, no characters are checked against the list of vowels, and the list comprehension returns an empty list. The `join` method then concatenates the elements of this empty list into an empty string, which is returned as the output.

Thus, the output of executing `remove_vowels` on an empty string is another empty string.
