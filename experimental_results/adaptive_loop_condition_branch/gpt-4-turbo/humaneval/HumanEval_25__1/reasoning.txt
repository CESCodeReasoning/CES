The function `factorize` is called with the argument `n = 3 * 19 * 3 * 19 = 1089`.
The function aims to factorize the number 1089 into its prime factors.

1. Initialize an empty list `fact` to store factors and set `i = 2`.
2. Calculate `math.sqrt(1089) + 1 â‰ˆ 33.016 + 1 = 34.016`, so `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) = 34`.
3. Start a while loop that runs while `i <= 34`.

First Iteration (`i = 2`):
   - `1089 % 2 != 0`, so the condition `n % i == 0` is false. Increment `i` to 3.

Second Iteration (`i = 3`):
   - `1089 % 3 == 0`, so the condition `n % i == 0` is true. Append `3` to `fact` and update `n = 1089 // 3 = 363`. Increment `i` to 3 (stays the same since we need to check for multiple factors of 3).

Third Iteration (`i = 3`):
   - `363 % 3 == 0`, so the condition `n % i == 0` is true again. Append `3` to `fact` and update `n = 363 // 3 = 121`. Increment `i` to 3 (stays the same).

Fourth Iteration (`i = 3`):
   - `121 % 3 != 0`, so the condition `n % i == 0` is false. Increment `i` to 4.

Subsequent Iterations (`i = 4` to `i = 10`):
   - None of these values of `i` divide 121, so `i` is incremented each time until `i = 11`.

Iteration (`i = 11`):
   - `121 % 11 == 0`, so the condition `n % i == 0` is true. Append `11` to `fact` and update `n = 121 // 11 = 11`. Increment `i` to 11 (stays the same).

Next Iteration (`i = 11`):
   - `11 % 11 == 0`, so the condition `n % i == 0` is true again. Append `11` to `fact` and update `n = 11 // 11 = 1`. Increment `i` to 12.

5. The while loop exits as `i` becomes 12 which is greater than 34.
6. Check if `n > 1` after the loop. Since `n = 1`, this condition is false.

The function returns the list `[3, 3, 11, 11]` which are the prime factors of 1089.
