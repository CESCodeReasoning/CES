The function `largest_smallest_integers` takes a list of integers as input and aims to find the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer from the list. The function uses two filters:
1. `smallest` filters for negative integers (`x < 0`).
2. `largest` filters for positive integers (`x > 0`).

For the input list `[2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]`, the steps are as follows:
- The `smallest` filter checks for negative integers. Since there are no negative integers in the list, `smallest` becomes an empty list.
- The `largest` filter checks for positive integers. All integers in the list are positive, so `largest` contains `[2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]`.

Next, the function attempts to find the maximum value of the `smallest` list and the minimum value of the `largest` list:
- Since `smallest` is empty, `max(smallest)` does not execute, and the function returns `None` for the largest negative integer.
- `min(largest)` successfully finds the minimum value among the positive integers, which is `1`.

Thus, the function returns a tuple `(None, 1)`, indicating no largest negative integer and `1` as the smallest positive integer.
