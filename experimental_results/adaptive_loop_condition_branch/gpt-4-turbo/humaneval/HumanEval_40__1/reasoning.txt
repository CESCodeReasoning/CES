The function `triples_sum_to_zero(l)` takes a list `l` of integers as its parameter. The function aims to find if there exists any triplet within the list whose sum equals zero.

The function uses three nested loops to iterate over all possible triplets in the list:
- The outer loop iterates over each element, using index `i`.
- The middle loop starts from the element next to `i`, using index `j`.
- The innermost loop starts from the element next to `j`, using index `k`.

For each triplet `(l[i], l[j], l[k])`, the function checks if their sum is zero. If a triplet is found with a sum of zero, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such triplet is found after checking all possibilities, the function returns `False`.

Let's analyze the execution:
- For `i=0` (l[i]=2):
  - `j=1` (l[j]=4):
    - `k=2` (l[k]=-5): The sum is 2 + 4 - 5 = 1 (not zero).
    - `k=3` (l[k]=3): The sum is 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 (not zero).
    - `k=4` (l[k]=9): The sum is 2 + 4 + 9 = 15 (not zero).
    - `k=5` (l[k]=7): The sum is 2 + 4 + 7 = 13 (not zero).
  - `j=2` (l[j]=-5):
    - `k=3` (l[k]=3): The sum is 2 - 5 + 3 = 0 (zero). The function returns `True` here.

Since a triplet summing to zero is found, the function does not proceed with further iterations and returns `True`.
