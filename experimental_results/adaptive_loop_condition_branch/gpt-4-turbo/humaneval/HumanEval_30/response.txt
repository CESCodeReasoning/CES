[REASONING]
The function `get_positive` takes a list of integers `l` as input and returns a new list containing only the positive integers from the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function `get_positive` on the input `[-1, -2, 4, 5, 6]`, the function iterates over each element in the list and checks if it is greater than 0.
- The first element `-1` is not greater than 0, so it is not included in the output list.
- The second element `-2` is also not greater than 0, so it is not included in the output list.
- The third element `4` is greater than 0, so it is included in the output list.
- The fourth element `5` is greater than 0, so it is included in the output list.
- The fifth element `6` is greater than 0, so it is included in the output list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `get_positive` on the input `[-1, -2, 4, 5, 6]` is `[4, 5, 6]`.

[ANSWER]
```python
from typing import *
def get_positive(l: list):
    # [STATE] l is [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6] [/STATE]
    return [e for e in l if e > 0]  # [CONDITION] e > 0 [/CONDITION]
```
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[4, 5, 6]
