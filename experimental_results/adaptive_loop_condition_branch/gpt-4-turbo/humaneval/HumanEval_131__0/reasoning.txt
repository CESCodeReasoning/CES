The function `digits` is called with the argument `n = 120`.
Inside the function:
- A variable `product` is initialized to 1.
- A variable `odd_count` is initialized to 0.
- The number `120` is converted to a string and iterated over character by character.

Iteration 1:
   - The character '1' is converted to integer 1.
   - Since 1 is odd (`1 % 2 == 1`), the product is updated to `1 * 1 = 1` and `odd_count` is incremented to 1.

Iteration 2:
   - The character '2' is converted to integer 2.
   - Since 2 is even (`2 % 2 == 0`), neither `product` nor `odd_count` is updated.

Iteration 3:
   - The character '0' is converted to integer 0.
   - Since 0 is even (`0 % 2 == 0`), neither `product` nor `odd_count` is updated.

After the loop:
- The `odd_count` is checked. Since `odd_count` is not 0 (it's 1), the function returns the value of `product`, which is 1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `digits(120)` is 1.
