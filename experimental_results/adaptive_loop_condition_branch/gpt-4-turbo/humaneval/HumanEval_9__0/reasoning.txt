The function `rolling_max` is called with the list `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to `None` and an empty list `result` is created to store the running maximum values.

Iteration 1:
    - The number `n` is 4.
    - Since `running_max` is `None`, it is set to 4.
    - The `result` list is updated to `[4]`.

Iteration 2:
    - The number `n` is 3.
    - `running_max` is not `None` now, so we compare `running_max` (4) with `n` (3).
    - The maximum remains 4.
    - The `result` list is updated to `[4, 4]`.

Iteration 3:
    - The number `n` is 2.
    - Again, `running_max` (4) is compared with `n` (2).
    - The maximum remains 4.
    - The `result` list is updated to `[4, 4, 4]`.

Iteration 4:
    - The number `n` is 1.
    - `running_max` (4) is compared with `n` (1).
    - The maximum remains 4.
    - The `result` list is updated to `[4, 4, 4, 4]`.

The function returns the list `[4, 4, 4, 4]` which represents the running maximum of the input list at each step.
