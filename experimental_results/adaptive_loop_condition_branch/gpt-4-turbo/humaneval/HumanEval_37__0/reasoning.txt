The function `sort_even` is called with the list `[5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]`.
Inside the function:
1. `evens` is initialized by slicing the list to get elements at even indices: `[5, -5, -3, 9, 123, -10]`.
2. `odds` is initialized by slicing the list to get elements at odd indices: `[3, 2, 3, 0, 1]`.
3. Both `evens` and `odds` are sorted. `evens` becomes `[-10, -5, -3, 5, 9, 123]` and `odds` becomes `[0, 1, 2, 3, 3]`.
4. An empty list `ans` is initialized.
5. A loop iterates over pairs of elements from `evens` and `odds` using `zip`, which pairs up elements from both lists.
   - In each iteration, elements from `evens` and `odds` are added to `ans` in pairs.
6. After the loop, the function checks if the length of `evens` is greater than `odds`. Since `len(evens) = 6` and `len(odds) = 5`, the condition is true.
   - The last element of `evens` (`123`) is appended to `ans`.
7. The function returns the list `ans`.

The final sorted and interleaved list is `[-10, 0, -5, 1, -3, 2, 5, 3, 9, 3, 123]`.
