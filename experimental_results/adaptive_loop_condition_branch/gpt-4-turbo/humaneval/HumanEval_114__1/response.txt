[REASONING]
The function `minSubArraySum` is called with the list `nums = [0, 10, 20, 1000000]`.
Inside the function:
- `max_sum` is initialized to 0.
- `s` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
   - `num` is 0. `s` becomes `s + (-0) = 0`.
   - Since `s` is not less than 0, the condition `(s < 0)` is false.
   - `max_sum` remains 0 as `max(s, max_sum)` is `max(0, 0)`.

Iteration 2:
   - `num` is 10. `s` becomes `s + (-10) = -10`.
   - `s` is less than 0, so the condition `(s < 0)` is true.
   - `s` is reset to 0.
   - `max_sum` remains 0 as `max(s, max_sum)` is `max(0, 0)`.

Iteration 3:
   - `num` is 20. `s` becomes `s + (-20) = -20`.
   - `s` is less than 0, so the condition `(s < 0)` is true.
   - `s` is reset to 0.
   - `max_sum` remains 0 as `max(s, max_sum)` is `max(0, 0)`.

Iteration 4:
   - `num` is 1000000. `s` becomes `s + (-1000000) = -1000000`.
   - `s` is less than 0, so the condition `(s < 0)` is true.
   - `s` is reset to 0.
   - `max_sum` remains 0 as `max(s, max_sum)` is `max(0, 0)`.

After the loop:
- The condition `(max_sum == 0)` is true because `max_sum` is 0.
- The generator expression `max(-i for i in nums)` calculates the maximum of `-0, -10, -20, -1000000`, which is 0.
- `min_sum` is calculated as `-max_sum`, resulting in `-0`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([0, 10, 20, 1000000])` is 0.
