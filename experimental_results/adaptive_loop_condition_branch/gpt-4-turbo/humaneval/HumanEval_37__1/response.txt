[REASONING]
The function `sort_even` is called with the list `[1, 2, 3]`.
Inside the function:
1. The list `evens` is created by slicing the input list to get every second element starting from the first, resulting in `[1, 3]`.
2. The list `odds` is created by slicing the input list to get every second element starting from the second, resulting in `[2]`.
3. Both lists are sorted. `evens` remains `[1, 3]` as it is already in ascending order, and `odds` remains `[2]`.
4. An empty list `ans` is initialized.
5. A loop iterates over pairs of elements from `evens` and `odds` using `zip`. This results in one iteration with `e = 1` and `o = 2`.
6. In this iteration, `[1, 2]` is appended to `ans`, making `ans = [1, 2]`.
7. After the loop, the condition checks if the length of `evens` is greater than the length of `odds`. Since `len(evens) = 2` and `len(odds) = 1`, the condition is true.
8. The last element of `evens`, which is `3`, is appended to `ans`.
9. The function returns the list `[1, 2, 3]`.
