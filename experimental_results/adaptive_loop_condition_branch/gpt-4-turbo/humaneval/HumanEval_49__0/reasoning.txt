The function `modp` is called with `n = 3` and `p = 11`.
Inside the function, a variable `ret` is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 0 through 2 (since `n = 3`).

First Iteration (i = 0):
    `ret = (2 * ret) % p` updates `ret` to (2 * 1) % 11 = 2.

Second Iteration (i = 1):
    `ret = (2 * ret) % p` updates `ret` to (2 * 2) % 11 = 4.

Third Iteration (i = 2):
    `ret = (2 * ret) % p` updates `ret` to (2 * 4) % 11 = 8.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ret`, which is now 8.
