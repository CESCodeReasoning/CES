The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with `n = 123`.
Inside the function, two counters `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.
The function includes a nested function `is_palindrome` which checks if a number is a palindrome by comparing the string of the number to its reverse.

The loop iterates from 1 through 123 (inclusive).
For each number `i`:
- If `i` is odd (`i % 2 == 1`) and a palindrome (`is_palindrome(i)` returns True), then `odd_palindrome_count` is incremented.
- If `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`) and a palindrome, then `even_palindrome_count` is incremented.

The function `is_palindrome` is called for each number to check if it is a palindrome. For example:
- `1` is a palindrome, so `odd_palindrome_count` becomes 1.
- `2` is a palindrome, so `even_palindrome_count` becomes 1.
- This continues for all numbers up to 123.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the counts of even and odd palindromes.

The output will be the counts of even and odd palindromes from 1 to 123.
