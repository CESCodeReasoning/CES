[REASONING]
The function `filter_by_substring` takes two parameters: a list of strings `strings` and a string `substring`. It returns a new list containing only those strings from the input list that contain the specified `substring`.
To determine the output of executing the function `filter_by_substring` on the input list `['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']` with the substring `'xxx'`, we need to check each string in the list to see if it contains the substring `'xxx'`.

1. 'xxx' contains 'xxx' -> included in the output list.
2. 'asd' does not contain 'xxx' -> not included.
3. 'xxy' does not contain 'xxx' -> not included.
4. 'john doe' does not contain 'xxx' -> not included.
5. 'xxxAAA' contains 'xxx' -> included in the output list.
6. 'xxx' contains 'xxx' -> included in the output list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `filter_by_substring` on the given input is `['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']`.

[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    # [STATE] strings = ['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], substring = 'xxx' [/STATE]
    return [x for x in strings if substring in x]  # [CONDITION] substring in x [/CONDITION]
[PYTHON]

[OUTPUT]
['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']
[/OUTPUT]
