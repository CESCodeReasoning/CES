[REASONING]
The function `unique` takes a list `l` as input. The purpose of this function is to return a new list containing only unique elements from the input list, sorted in ascending order.
Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the function execution:
1. Convert the list `l` to a set to remove duplicates. The set created from the list `[2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]` is `{1, 2}`.
2. Convert the set back to a list. The list now is `[1, 2]`.
3. Sort the list. Since the list `[1, 2]` is already in ascending order, it remains unchanged.
4. Return the sorted list.

Thus, the output of executing the function `unique` on the input `[2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]` is `[1, 2]`.

[ANSWER]
```python
from typing import *

def unique(l: list):
    # [STATE] l is [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1] [/STATE]
    return sorted(list(set(l)))  # [STATE] set(l) is {1, 2}, list(set(l)) is [1, 2], sorted(list(set(l))) is [1, 2] [/STATE]
```
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
[1, 2]
