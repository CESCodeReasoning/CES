[REASONING]
The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with the list `["d", "dcba", "abcd", "a"]`.
Inside the function:
1. The list `lst` is sorted alphabetically, resulting in `["a", "abcd", "d", "dcba"]`.
2. A new list `new_lst` is initialized to an empty list.
3. The function iterates over each element in the sorted list `lst`.

Iteration 1:
   - The element 'a' has a length of 1, which is odd.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is false.
   - The branch is not taken.

Iteration 2:
   - The element 'abcd' has a length of 4, which is even.
   - The condition `len(i) % 2 == 0` is true.
   - The branch is taken and 'abcd' is added to `new_lst`.

Iteration 3:
   - The element 'd' has a length of 1, which is odd.
   - The condition is false.
   - The branch is not taken.

Iteration 4:
   - The element 'dcba' has a length of 4, which is even.
   - The condition is true.
   - The branch is taken and 'dcba' is added to `new_lst`.

4. After the loop, `new_lst` contains `['abcd', 'dcba']`.
5. The function returns `new_lst` sorted by the length of its elements. Since all elements have the same length, the order remains `['abcd', 'dcba']`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `sorted_list_sum(["d", "dcba", "abcd", "a"])` is `['abcd', 'dcba']`.
