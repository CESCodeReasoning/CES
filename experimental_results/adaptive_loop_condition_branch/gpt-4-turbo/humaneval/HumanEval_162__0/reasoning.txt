The function `string_to_md5` takes a string `text` as input. It uses the hashlib library to compute the MD5 hash of the string after encoding it to ASCII format. If the input string is empty, the function returns `None` instead of computing the hash.

In this specific case, the input to the function is an empty string (''). According to the function's logic:
1. The function checks if the input string `text` is truthy. Since an empty string is falsy, this check will fail.
2. As a result of the check failing, the function returns `None` without attempting to compute the MD5 hash.

Thus, the output of the function when called with an empty string is `None`.
