[REASONING]
The function `double_the_difference` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of the squares of all positive odd integers in the list. The function uses a list comprehension to filter and process the elements of the input list:
1. The list comprehension iterates over each element `i` in the list `lst`.
2. It checks three conditions for each element `i`:
   - `i > 0`: The element must be positive.
   - `i % 2 != 0`: The element must be odd.
   - `"." not in str(i)`: The element must not be a floating-point number (this is checked by converting the element to a string and ensuring it does not contain a decimal point).
3. If all conditions are met, the square of the element `i` (`i**2`) is calculated and included in the new list generated by the list comprehension.
4. The `sum` function then adds up all the squared values from the list comprehension to produce the final result.

For the input `[0.2, 3, 5]`:
- `0.2` is not included because it is a floating-point number.
- `3` is included because it is a positive odd integer.
- `5` is also included because it is a positive odd integer.
The squares of `3` and `5` are `9` and `25`, respectively. The sum of `9` and `25` is `34`.

Thus, the output of the function when called with the input `[0.2, 3, 5]` is `34`.

[ANSWER]
```python
from typing import *
def double_the_difference(lst):
    # [STATE] lst = [0.2, 3, 5] [/STATE]
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i%2!=0 and "." not in str(i)])  # [CONDITION] i > 0 and i%2!=0 and "." not in str(i) [/CONDITION]
    # [BRANCH] Y [/BRANCH] for i = 3 and i = 5
    # [BRANCH] N [/BRANCH] for i = 0.2
```
