The function `starts_one_ends` is called with the argument `n = 1`.
The function checks if `n` is equal to 1. Since `n` is indeed 1, the condition `(n == 1)` evaluates to True.
As the condition is True, the function immediately returns 1 without proceeding to the calculation in the `return` statement outside the `if` block.
Therefore, the output of the function `starts_one_ends(1)` is 1.
