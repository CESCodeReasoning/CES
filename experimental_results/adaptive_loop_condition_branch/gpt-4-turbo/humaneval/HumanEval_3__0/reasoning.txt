The function `below_zero` is called with the list of operations `[1, 2, -4, 5, 6]`.
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - The operation is `1`. The balance becomes `1` (0 + 1).
    - The balance is not less than 0, so the condition `(balance < 0)` is false.
Iteration 2:
    - The operation is `2`. The balance updates to `3` (1 + 2).
    - The balance is still not less than 0, so the condition remains false.
Iteration 3:
    - The operation is `-4`. The balance updates to `-1` (3 - 4).
    - The balance is now less than 0, so the condition `(balance < 0)` is true.
    - The function returns `True` immediately without proceeding to the next operations.

Since the balance goes below zero during the third operation, the function returns `True` indicating that the balance did go below zero at some point.
