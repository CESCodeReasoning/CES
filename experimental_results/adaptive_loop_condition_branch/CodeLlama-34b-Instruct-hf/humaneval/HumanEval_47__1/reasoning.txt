The function `median` is called with ( l = [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20] ).
The length of the list is 6, which is odd.
The condition `len(l) % 2 == 1` is true.
The `if` branch is taken and the method returns the middle element of the sorted list, which is 6.

Therefore, the final output of the function `median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])` is 6.
