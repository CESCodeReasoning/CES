<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def anti_shuffle(s):
    return ' '.join([''.join(sorted(list(i))) for i in s.split(' ')])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!')
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
def anti_shuffle(s):
    return ' '.join([''.join(sorted(list(i))) for i in s.split(' ')])
[/PYTHON]
[REASONING]
The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input and returns a new string with the same words as s, but with the letters of each word sorted alphabetically.
To determine the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input 'Hello World!!!', we need to split the string into individual words, sort the letters of each word alphabetically, and then join the words back together with a space between them.
Therefore, the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input 'Hello World!!!' is 'eHll oWd!rl'.
[/REASONING]
[OUTPUT]
'eHll oWd!rl'
[/OUTPUT]</s>
