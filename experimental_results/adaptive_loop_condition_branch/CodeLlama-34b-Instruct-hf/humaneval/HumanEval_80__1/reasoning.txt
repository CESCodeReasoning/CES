The function `is_happy` is called with ( s = "xyy" ).
Inside the function, the first condition checks if the length of `s` is less than 3.
Since the length of "xyy" is 3, the condition is false, and the function proceeds to the loop.

The loop iterates over the indices of `s` from 0 to (len(s) - 2).
In this case, the loop iterates over the indices 0, 1, and 2.

For each iteration, the function checks if any of the following conditions are true:

* `s[i] == s[i + 1]`
* `s[i + 1] == s[i + 2]`
* `s[i] == s[i + 2]`

If any of these conditions are true, the function returns `False`.

Since the conditions are not true for any iteration, the function returns `True`.
