The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "full" ).
Inside the function, a variable `vowels` is initialized to a set of vowel characters.
The length of the input word is checked, and if it is less than 3, the function returns an empty string.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'f' is not in vowels, so the function moves on to the next character.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'u' is not in vowels, so the function moves on to the next character.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'l' is not in vowels, so the function moves on to the next character.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'l' is not in vowels, so the function moves on to the next character.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 'f' is not in vowels, so the function moves on to the next character.
