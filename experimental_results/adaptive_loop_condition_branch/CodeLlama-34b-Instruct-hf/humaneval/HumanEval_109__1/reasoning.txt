The function `move_one_ball` is called with ( arr = [3, 5, 4, 1, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `sorted_array` is initialized to the sorted version of `arr`.
A variable `my_arr` is initialized to an empty list.

The length of `arr` is checked. If it is 0, the function returns `True`.

The minimum value in `arr` is found and its index is stored in `min_index`.

`my_arr` is updated to contain the elements of `arr` from `min_index` to the end, followed by the elements from the beginning to `min_index`.

The function then iterates over the length of `arr`.

For each iteration, if the element at index `i` in `my_arr` is not equal to the element at index `i` in `sorted_array`, the function returns `False`.

If the function completes the iteration without returning `False`, it returns `True`.
