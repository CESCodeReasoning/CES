The function `compare_one` is called with ( a = "1" ) and ( b = "2" ).
`temp_a` and `temp_b` are initialized to `a` and `b`, respectively.
`temp_a` is a string, so the first if branch is taken and `temp_a` is replaced with "1.0".
`temp_b` is also a string, so the second if branch is taken and `temp_b` is replaced with "2.0".
The condition `float(temp_a) == float(temp_b)` is false, so the first if branch is not taken.
The function returns `a` if `float(temp_a) > float(temp_b)`, which is false in this case.
Therefore, the function returns `b`, which is "2".
