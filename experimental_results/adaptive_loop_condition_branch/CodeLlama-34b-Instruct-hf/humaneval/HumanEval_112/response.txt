<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def reverse_delete(s,c):
    s = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in c])
    return (s,s[::-1] == s)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
reverse_delete("abcde","ae") 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    s = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in c])
    return (s, s[::-1] == s)
[/PYTHON]
[REASONING]
The function reverse_delete takes two inputs: a string s and a string c.
It first removes all characters in c from s, and then checks if the remaining string is a palindrome.
To determine the output of executing the function reverse_delete on the input "abcde" and "ae", we need to follow these steps:
1. Remove all characters in "ae" from "abcde". This gives us "bc".
2. Check if "bc" is a palindrome. It is not, so the function returns ("bc", False).
[/REASONING]
[OUTPUT]
("bc", False)
[/OUTPUT]</s>
