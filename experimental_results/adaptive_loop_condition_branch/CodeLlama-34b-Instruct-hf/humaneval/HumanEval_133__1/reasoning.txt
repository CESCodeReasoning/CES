The function `sum_squares` is called with (lst = [-2.4, 1, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `squared` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the elements of `lst`.
First Iteration (i = -2.4):
    `math.ceil(i)` = 3 (since -2.4 is less than 3).
    `3**2` = 9.
    `squared` = 9.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    `math.ceil(i)` = 1 (since 1 is less than 1).
    `1**2` = 1.
    `squared` = 10 (9 + 1).
Third Iteration (i = 1):
    `math.ceil(i)` = 1 (since 1 is less than 1).
    `1**2` = 1.
    `squared` = 11 (10 + 1).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `squared`, which is now 11.
