The function `largest_divisor` is called with ( n = 100 ).
Inside the function, a loop iterates from 99 to 0 (since ( n = 100 )).
First Iteration (i = 99)
   - `i` is 99, which does not divide `n` evenly.
   - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Second Iteration (i = 98)
   - `i` is 98, which does not divide `n` evenly.
   - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Third Iteration (i = 97)
   - `i` is 97, which does not divide `n` evenly.
   - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
   - No action is taken.
...
Fifty-First Iteration (i = 51)
   - `i` is 51, which does not divide `n` evenly.
   - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
   - No action is taken.
Fifty-Second Iteration (i = 50)
   - `i` is 50, which divides `n` evenly.
   - The condition `n % i == 0` is true.
   - Action: `return i` returns the value of `i`, which is 50.

Therefore, the final output of the function `largest_divisor(100)` is 50.
