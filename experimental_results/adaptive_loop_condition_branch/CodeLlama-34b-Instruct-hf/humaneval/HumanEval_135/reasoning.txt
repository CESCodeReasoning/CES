The function `can_arrange` is called with (arr = [1,2,4,3,5]).
Inside the function, a variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since (len(arr) = 5)).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    - i < 5 when i=1
    - The conditin `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`ind = i` updates `ind` to 1 ( -1 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - i < 5 when i=2
    - The conditin `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` is true.
    -`ind = i` updates `ind` to 2 ( 1 + 1 = 2 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    - i < 5 when i=3.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`ind = i` updates `ind` to 3 ( 2 + 1 = 3 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4)
    - i < 5 when i=4.
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`ind = i` updates `ind` to 4 ( 3 + 1 = 4 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 5)
    -  i < 5 when i=5
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The loop completes.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is now 4.
