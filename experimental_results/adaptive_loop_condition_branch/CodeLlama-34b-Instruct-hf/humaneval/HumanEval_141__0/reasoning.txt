The function `file_name_check` is called with (file_name = 'I563_No.exe').
The function splits the file name into a list using the '.' character as the separator.
The length of the list is checked, and if it is not equal to 2, the function returns 'No'.
The second element of the list is checked to see if it is in the list of allowed file extensions (['txt', 'exe', 'dll']). If it is not, the function returns 'No'.
The length of the first element of the list is checked, and if it is 0, the function returns 'No'.
The first character of the first element of the list is checked to see if it is a letter. If it is not, the function returns 'No'.
The function then checks if there are more than 3 digits in the first element of the list. If there are, the function returns 'No'.
If all of the above conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.
