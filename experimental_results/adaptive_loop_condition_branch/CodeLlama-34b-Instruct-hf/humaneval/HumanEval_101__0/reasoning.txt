The function `words_string` is called with ( s = "One, two, three, four, five, six" ).
Inside the function, a variable `s_list` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'O' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 'n' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'e' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ',' is a comma, so a space is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character 't' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character 'w' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 8:
    -The character 'o' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 9:
    -The character ',' is a comma, so a space is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 10:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 11:
    -The character 't' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 12:
    -The character 'h' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 13:
    -The character 'r' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 14:
    -The character 'e' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 15:
    -The character 'e' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 16:
    -The character ',' is a comma, so a space is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 17:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 18:
    -The character 'f' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 19:
    -The character 'o' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 20:
    -The character 'u' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 21:
    -The character 'r' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 22:
    -The character ',' is a comma, so a space is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 23:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 24:
    -The character 'f' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 25:
    -The character 'i' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 26:
    -The character 'v' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 27:
    -The character 'e' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 28:
    -The character ',' is a comma, so a space is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 29:
    -The character ' ' (space) is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 30:
    -The character 's' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 31:
    -The character 'i' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.
Iteration 32:
    -The character 'x' is not a comma, so it is appended to `s_list`.

After the loop completes, `s_list` is joined into a string using the `join` method.
The resulting string is then split into a list of words using the `split` method.
The list of words is returned as the output of the function.
