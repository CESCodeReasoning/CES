The function `monotonic` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 4, 20] ).
The function checks if the list `l` is sorted in ascending or descending order.
The condition `l == sorted(l)` checks if the list `l` is sorted in ascending order.
The condition `l == sorted(l, reverse=True)` checks if the list `l` is sorted in descending order.
If either of the conditions is true, the function returns True.

Therefore, the final output of the function `monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])` is True.
