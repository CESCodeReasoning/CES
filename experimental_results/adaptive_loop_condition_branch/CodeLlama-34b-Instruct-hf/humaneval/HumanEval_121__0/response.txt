<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def solution(lst):
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx % 2 == 0 and x % 2 == 1])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
solution([2, 4, 8])
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
def solution(lst):
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx % 2 == 0 and x % 2 == 1])
[/PYTHON]
[TESTS]
# Test case 1:
assert solution([2, 4, 8]) == 2
# Test case 2:
assert solution([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) == 1
# Test case 3:
assert solution([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) == 2
# Test case 4:
assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) == 1
# Test case 5:
assert solution([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]) == 1
