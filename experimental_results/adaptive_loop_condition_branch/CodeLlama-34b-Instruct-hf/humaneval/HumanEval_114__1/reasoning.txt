The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [0, 10, 20, 1000000] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the elements of `nums`.
First Iteration (num = 0)
   - `num` is 0, which does not satisfy ( s < 0 ).
   - The condition `s < 0` is false.
   - Action: `s` remains unchanged (`s = 0`).
Second Iteration (num = 10)
   - `num` is 10, which does not satisfy ( s < 0 ).
   - The condition `s < 0` is false.
   - Action: `s` remains unchanged (`s = 0`).
Third Iteration (num = 20)
   - `num` is 20, which does not satisfy ( s < 0 ).
   - The condition `s < 0` is false.
   - Action: `s` remains unchanged (`s = 0`).
Fourth Iteration (num = 1000000)
   - `num` is 1000000, which satisfies ( s < 0 ).
   - The condition `s < 0` is true.
   - Action: `s` is updated to -1000000 (`s = -1000000`).
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `min_sum`, which is -1000000.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([0, 10, 20, 1000000])` is -1000000.
