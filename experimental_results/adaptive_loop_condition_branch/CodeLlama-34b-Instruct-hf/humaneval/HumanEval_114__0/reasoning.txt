The function `minSubArraySum` is called with ( nums = [1, -1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `max_sum` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the elements of `nums`.
First Iteration (num = 1)
   - `num` is 1, which is not less than 0.
   - The condition `s < 0` is false.
   - Action: `s` is not updated.
Second Iteration (num = -1)
   - `num` is -1, which is less than 0.
   - The condition `s < 0` is true.
   - Action: `s` is updated to 0.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `min_sum`, which is -1.

Therefore, the final output of the function `minSubArraySum([1, -1])` is -1.
