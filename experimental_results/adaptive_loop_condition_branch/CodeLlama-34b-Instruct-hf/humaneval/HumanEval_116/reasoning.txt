The function sort_array takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted version of the array based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each integer.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4], we need to sort the array based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each integer.
The binary representation of each integer in the input array is as follows:
1: 1
5: 101
2: 10
3: 11
4: 100
The number of 1s in the binary representation of each integer is as follows:
1: 1
5: 2
2: 1
3: 2
4: 1
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4] is [1,2,3,4,5].
