<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def sort_array(arr):
    return sorted(sorted(arr), key=lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1'))
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sort_array([1,5,2,3,4]) 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
def sort_array(arr):
    return sorted(sorted(arr), key=lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1'))
[/PYTHON]
[REASONING]
The function sort_array takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted version of the array based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each integer.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4], we need to sort the array based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of each integer.
The binary representation of each integer in the input array is as follows:
1: 1
5: 101
2: 10
3: 11
4: 100
The number of 1s in the binary representation of each integer is as follows:
1: 1
5: 2
2: 1
3: 2
4: 1
Therefore, the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [1,5,2,3,4] is [1,2,3,4,5].
[/REASONING]
[OUTPUT]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[/OUTPUT]</s>
