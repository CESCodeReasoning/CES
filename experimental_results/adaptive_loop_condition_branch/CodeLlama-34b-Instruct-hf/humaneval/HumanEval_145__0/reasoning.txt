The function `order_by_points` is called with a list of integers.
The function first defines a helper function `digits_sum` that takes an integer `n` as input.
The `digits_sum` function first checks if `n` is negative. If it is, it multiplies `n` by -1 to make it positive and sets `neg` to -1.
It then converts `n` to a list of integers, with each digit of `n` as an element of the list.
It then multiplies the first element of the list by `neg` to ensure that the sign of the first digit is correct.
It then returns the sum of the elements of the list.
The `order_by_points` function then sorts the input list using the `digits_sum` function as the key.
It returns the sorted list.
