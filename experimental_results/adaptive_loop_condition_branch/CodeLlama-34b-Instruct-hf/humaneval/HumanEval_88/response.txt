<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def sort_array(array):
    return [] if len(array) == 0 else sorted(array, reverse= (array[0]+array[-1]) % 2 == 0) 
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sort_array([15, 42, 87, 32 ,11, 0]) 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
def sort_array(array):
    return [] if len(array) == 0 else sorted(array, reverse= (array[0]+array[-1]) % 2 == 0)
[/PYTHON]
[REASONING]
The function sort_array takes an array as input and returns an empty array if the length of the array is 0. Otherwise, it returns the sorted array in descending order if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, and in ascending order if the sum is odd.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [15, 42, 87, 32, 11, 0], we need to first check if the length of the array is 0. Since the length of the array is 6, which is not equal to 0, we proceed to the next step.
The sum of the first and last elements of the array is 15 + 0 = 15, which is odd. Therefore, the sorted array in ascending order is [0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87].
[/REASONING]
[OUTPUT]
[0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87]
[/OUTPUT]</s>
