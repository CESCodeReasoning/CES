The function sort_array takes an array as input and returns an empty array if the length of the array is 0. Otherwise, it returns the sorted array in descending order if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, and in ascending order if the sum is odd.
To determine the output of executing the function sort_array on the input [15, 42, 87, 32, 11, 0], we need to first check if the length of the array is 0. Since the length of the array is 6, which is not equal to 0, we proceed to the next step.
The sum of the first and last elements of the array is 15 + 0 = 15, which is odd. Therefore, the sorted array in ascending order is [0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87].
