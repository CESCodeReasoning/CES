The function count_distinct_characters takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function on the input 'abcde', we need to first convert the string to lowercase using the lower() method.
The resulting string is 'abcde'.
Next, we create a set from the lowercase string, which removes any duplicates.
The resulting set is {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}.
Finally, we return the length of the set, which is 5.
Therefore, the output of executing the function on the input 'abcde' is 5.
