The function add takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 0, 6, 7], we need to iterate through the list and sum up all the even numbers.
The even numbers in the list are 4, 6, and 0. Therefore, the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 0, 6, 7] is 10.
