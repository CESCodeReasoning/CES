The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input and returns a new string with the same characters as s, but with the letters in each word sorted alphabetically.
To determine the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input '', we need to split the input into words, sort the letters in each word, and then join the words back together.
Since the input is an empty string, there are no words to sort, so the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input '' is also an empty string.
