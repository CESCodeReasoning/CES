The function right_angle_triangle takes three arguments a, b, and c, which are the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function checks if the triangle is a right angle triangle by checking if the square of the length of any side is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

To determine the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input (1, 1, 1), we need to check if the square of 1 is equal to the sum of the squares of 1 and 1.

1 * 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 2
1 is not equal to 2, so the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input (1, 1, 1) is False.
