The function `solve` is called with ( s = "#a@C" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through each character in `s`.
First Iteration (i = '#')
   - `i` is not a letter, so the condition `i.isalpha()` is false.
   - The `else` block is not executed.
Second Iteration (i = 'a')
   - `i` is a letter, so the condition `i.isalpha()` is true.
   - The `if` block is executed.
   - `new_str[idx]` is set to `i.swapcase()`, which is 'A'.
   - `flg` is set to 1.
Third Iteration (i = '@')
   - `i` is not a letter, so the condition `i.isalpha()` is false.
   - The `else` block is not executed.
Fourth Iteration (i = 'C')
   - `i` is a letter, so the condition `i.isalpha()` is true.
   - The `if` block is executed.
   - `new_str[idx]` is set to `i.swapcase()`, which is 'c'.
   - `flg` is still 1.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns `s`.
   - Since `flg` is 1, the `if` block is executed.
   - The function returns `s[len(s)::-1]`, which is "cA".

Therefore, the final output of the function `solve("#a@C")` is "cA".
