The function common(l1, l2) takes two lists as input, l1 and l2.
The function first initializes an empty set named ret.
Then, it iterates through each element e1 in the first list l1 and each element e2 in the second list l2.
If e1 is equal to e2, then the element is added to the set ret.
Finally, the function returns a sorted list of the elements in ret.
