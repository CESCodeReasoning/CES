The function `solve` is called with ( s = "AsDf" ).
Inside the function, a variable `flg` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through each character in the input string ( s = "AsDf" ).
First Iteration (i = 'A')
   - `i` is 'A', which is an alphabetical character.
   - The condition `i.isalpha()` is true.
   - Action: `new_str[idx] = i.swapcase()` updates `new_str` to "aSDf".
Second Iteration (i = 's')
   - `i` is 's', which is not an alphabetical character.
   - The condition `i.isalpha()` is false.
   - Action: `new_str[idx] = i` updates `new_str` to "aSDf".
Third Iteration (i = 'D')
   - `i` is 'D', which is an alphabetical character.
   - The condition `i.isalpha()` is true.
   - Action: `new_str[idx] = i.swapcase()` updates `new_str` to "aSdF".
Fourth Iteration (i = 'f')
   - `i` is 'f', which is an alphabetical character.
   - The condition `i.isalpha()` is true.
   - Action: `new_str[idx] = i.swapcase()` updates `new_str` to "aSdF".
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `new_str`, which is now "aSdF".

Therefore, the final output of the function `solve("AsDf")` is "aSdF".
