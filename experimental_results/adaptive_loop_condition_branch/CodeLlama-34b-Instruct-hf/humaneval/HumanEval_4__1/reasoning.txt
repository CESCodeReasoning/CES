The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function mean_absolute_deviation on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], we need to calculate the mean of the input list and then calculate the absolute difference between each element of the input list and the mean.
The sum of these absolute differences is then divided by the length of the input list to give the mean absolute deviation.
Therefore, the output of executing the function mean_absolute_deviation on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] is 1.5.
