The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [4, 3, 2, 1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to `None`.
A variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    - `n` is 4, which is the first element of `numbers`.
    - `running_max` is `None`, so the `if` block is executed.
    - `running_max` is updated to 4.
    - 4 is appended to `result`.
Iteration 2:
    - `n` is 3, which is the second element of `numbers`.
    - `running_max` is 4, so the `else` block is executed.
    - `running_max` is updated to `max(4, 3)`, which is 4.
    - 4 is appended to `result`.
Iteration 3:
    - `n` is 2, which is the third element of `numbers`.
    - `running_max` is 4, so the `else` block is executed.
    - `running_max` is updated to `max(4, 2)`, which is 4.
    - 4 is appended to `result`.
Iteration 4:
    - `n` is 1, which is the fourth element of `numbers`.
    - `running_max` is 4, so the `else` block is executed.
    - `running_max` is updated to `max(4, 1)`, which is 4.
    - 4 is appended to `result`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `rolling_max([4, 3, 2, 1])` is [4, 4, 4, 4].
