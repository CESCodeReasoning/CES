The function `fix_spaces` is called with (text = "Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow").
Inside the function, a variable `new_text` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates through the characters in `text`.
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Y".
Second Iteration (i = 1):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Ye".
Third Iteration (i = 2):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Yel".
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 1.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Yel-".
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Yel-l".
Seventh Iteration (i = 6):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Yel-ll".
Eighth Iteration (i = 7):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Yel-ll_".
Ninth Iteration (i = 8):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 2.
Tenth Iteration (i = 9):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Yel-ll_D".
Eleventh Iteration (i = 10):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Yel-ll_Di".
Twelfth Iteration (i = 11):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Yel-ll_Dir".
Thirteenth Iteration (i = 12):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Yel-ll_Dirt".
Fourteenth Iteration (i = 13):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Yel-ll_Dirt_".
Fifteenth Iteration (i = 14):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `end += 1` updates `end` to 3.
Sixteenth Iteration (i = 15):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Yel-ll_Dirt_F".
Seventeenth Iteration (i = 16):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Yel-ll_Dirt_Fe".
Eighteenth Iteration (i = 17):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Yel-ll_Dirt_Fel".
Nineteenth Iteration (i = 18):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Yel-ll_Dirt_Fell".
Twentieth Iteration (i = 19):
    - The condition `text[i] == " "` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The else branch is taken. `new_text += text[i]` updates `new_text` to "Yel-ll_Dirt_Fellow".
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `new_text`, which is now "Yel-ll_Dirt_Fellow".
