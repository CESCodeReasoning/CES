The function `do_algebra` is called with (operator = ['//', '*'], operand = [7, 3, 4]).
Inside the function, a variable `expression` is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates over the `operator` and `operand` lists using the `zip()` function.
First Iteration (oprt = '//', oprn = 7):
    `expression` is updated to '7 // 3'
Second Iteration (oprt = '*', oprn = 4):
    `expression` is updated to '7 // 3 * 4'
After the loop completes, the function returns the result of evaluating the `expression` using `eval()`.
