The function `odd_count` is called with (lst = ['271', '137', '314']).
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates through the elements of `lst`.
First Iteration (arr = '271'):
    `n` is assigned the sum of the number of odd elements in `arr`.
    `res` is appended with a string that contains the number of odd elements in `arr`.
Second Iteration (arr = '137'):
    `n` is assigned the sum of the number of odd elements in `arr`.
    `res` is appended with a string that contains the number of odd elements in `arr`.
Third Iteration (arr = '314'):
    `n` is assigned the sum of the number of odd elements in `arr`.
    `res` is appended with a string that contains the number of odd elements in `arr`.
After the loop completes, the function returns `res`.
