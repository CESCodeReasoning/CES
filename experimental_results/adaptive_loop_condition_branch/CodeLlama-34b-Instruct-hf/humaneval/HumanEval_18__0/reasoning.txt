The function `how_many_times` is called with ( string = "xyxyxyx", substring = "x" ).
Inside the function, a variable `times` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `i` is 0, so the slice `string[i:i + len(substring)]` is "xyxyxyx".
    - The slice is not equal to "x", so the condition is false.
    - The `times` variable is not updated.
Iteration 2:
    - `i` is 1, so the slice `string[i:i + len(substring)]` is "yxyxyx".
    - The slice is not equal to "x", so the condition is false.
    - The `times` variable is not updated.
Iteration 3:
    - `i` is 2, so the slice `string[i:i + len(substring)]` is "xyxyx".
    - The slice is not equal to "x", so the condition is false.
    - The `times` variable is not updated.
Iteration 4:
    - `i` is 3, so the slice `string[i:i + len(substring)]` is "xyx".
    - The slice is not equal to "x", so the condition is false.
    - The `times` variable is not updated.
Iteration 5:
    - `i` is 4, so the slice `string[i:i + len(substring)]` is "xy".
    - The slice is not equal to "x", so the condition is false.
    - The `times` variable is not updated.
Iteration 6:
    - `i` is 5, so the slice `string[i:i + len(substring)]` is "x".
    - The slice is equal to "x", so the condition is true.
    - The `times` variable is updated to 1.
Iteration 7:
    - `i` is 6, so the slice `string[i:i + len(substring)]` is "".
    - The slice is not equal to "x", so the condition is false.
    - The `times` variable is not updated.

The function returns the value of `times`, which is 1.
