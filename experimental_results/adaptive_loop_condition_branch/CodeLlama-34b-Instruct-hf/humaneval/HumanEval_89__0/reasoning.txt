The function `encrypt` is called with ( s = 'et' ).
Inside the function, a variable `out` is initialized to an empty string.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'e' is in the string `d`, so the index of 'e' in `d` is found (which is 4).
    -The encrypted character is found by adding 2 * 2 to the index of 'e' in `d` and taking the result modulo 26 (which is 14).
    -The encrypted character is then appended to `out`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 't' is in the string `d`, so the index of 't' in `d` is found (which is 19).
    -The encrypted character is found by adding 2 * 2 to the index of 't' in `d` and taking the result modulo 26 (which is 23).
    -The encrypted character is then appended to `out`.
