The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with ( paren_string = "()()((((()()((()))))()()()))" ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered.
    -The current depth is 0, so it is incremented to 1.
    -The character '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -The current depth is 1, so it is decremented to 0.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since the current depth is 0, `current_string` is added to `result`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character '(' is encountered.
    -The current depth is 0, so it is incremented to 1.
    -The character '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -The current depth is 1, so it is decremented to 0.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since the current depth is 0, `current_string` is added to `result`.
Iteration 5:
    -The character '(' is encountered.
    -The current depth is 0, so it is incremented to 1.
    -The character '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character '(' is encountered.
    -The current depth is 1, so it is incremented to 2.
    -The character '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -The current depth is 2, so it is decremented to 1.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 8:
    -The character '(' is encountered.
    -The current depth is 1, so it is incremented to 2.
    -The character '(' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 9:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -The current depth is 2, so it is decremented to 1.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
Iteration 10:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -The current depth is 1, so it is decremented to 0.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since the current depth is 0, `current_string` is added to `result`.
Iteration 11:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -The current depth is 0, so it is decremented to -1.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since the current depth is -1, `current_string` is added to `result`.
Iteration 12:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -The current depth is -1, so it is decremented to -2.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since the current depth is -2, `current_string` is added to `result`.
Iteration 13:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -The current depth is -2, so it is decremented to -3.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since the current depth is -3, `current_string` is added to `result`.
Iteration 14:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -The current depth is -3, so it is decremented to -4.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since the current depth is -4, `current_string` is added to `result`.
Iteration 15:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -The current depth is -4, so it is decremented to -5.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since the current depth is -5, `current_string` is added to `result`.
Iteration 16:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -The current depth is -5, so it is decremented to -6.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since the current depth is -6, `current_string` is added to `result`.
Iteration 17:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -The current depth is -6, so it is decremented to -7.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since the current depth is -7, `current_string` is added to `result`.
Iteration 18:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -The current depth is -7, so it is decremented to -8.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since the current depth is -8, `current_string` is added to `result`.
Iteration 19:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -The current depth is -8, so it is decremented to -9.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since the current depth is -9, `current_string` is added to `result`.
Iteration 20:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -The current depth is -9, so it is decremented to -10.
    -The character ')' is appended to `current_string`.
    -Since the current depth is -10, `current_string` is added to `result`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `separate_paren_groups` is `['()', '()', '((((()()((()))))()()()))']`.
