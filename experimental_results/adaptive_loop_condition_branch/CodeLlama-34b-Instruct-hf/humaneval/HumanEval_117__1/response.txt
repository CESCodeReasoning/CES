<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
3. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
4. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
5. Enclose the annotated code with [PYTHON] AND [/PYTHON]
6. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].

    return duplicates
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
find_all_duplicate([3, 5, 4, 3, 7, 4])
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function find_all_duplicate(numbers) takes a list of numbers([3, 5, 4, 3, 7, 4]) as its parameter.
The outer loop iterats through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=3: compare with 5, 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 1 (numbers[j]=5), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 3 to duplicates.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken. 
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - numbers[i]=5: compare with 4, 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 2 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=4: compare with 3, 7, 4:
        - When j = 3 (numbers[j]=3), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is True, the if branch is taken. Append 4 to duplicates
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4, 5.
    - numbers[i]=3, Compare with 7, 4:
        - When j = 4 (numbers[j]=7), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - numbers[i] = 7, compare with 4:
        - When j = 5 (numbers[j]=4), the condition `numbers[i] == numbers[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    No more elements to compare.

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]):
[/QUESTION]
[/INST]  Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the code:

[REASONING]
The function select_words(s, n) takes a string s and an integer n as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each word in the string s.
In the inner loop, for each word indexed by i in the outer loop, count the number of consonants in the word.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, word is "Mary".
    - n_consonants is 0, the word "Mary" has 0 consonants.
    - The condition `n_consonants == n` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, word is "had".
    - n_consonants is 0, the word "had" has 0 consonants.
    - The condition `n_consonants == n` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, word is "a".
    - n_consonants is 0, the word "a" has 0 consonants.
    - The condition `n_consonants == n` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, word is "little".
    - n_consonants is 0, the word "little" has 0 consonants.
    - The condition `n_consonants == n` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, word is "lamb".
    - n_consonants is 0, the word "lamb" has 0 consonants.
    - The condition `n_consonants == n` is False, the if branch is not taken.
[/REASONING]

Here is the annotated code:

[PYTHON]
from typing import *


def select_words(s, n):
    result = []
    for word in s.split(): ## [STATE]word=["Mary", "had", "a", "little", "lamb"][/STATE][STATE]s.split()=["Mary", "had", "a", "little", "lamb"][/STATE]
        n_consonants = 0
        for i in range(0, len(word)): ## [STATE]i=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4][/STATE][STATE]range(0, len(word))=[[0], [0, 1], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]][/STATE][STATE]len(word)=[5][/STATE]
            if word[i].lower() not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]: ## [CONDITION](word[i].lower() not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"])=[F, F, F, F, F][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[F, F, F, F, F][/BRANCH]
                n_consonants += 1
        if n_consonants == n: ## [CONDITION](n_consonants == n)=[F, F, F, F, F][/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=[F, F, F, F, F][/BRANCH]
            result.append(word)
    return result
[/PYTHON]

And here is the output:
