The function select_words(s, n) takes a string s and an integer n as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each word in the string s.
In the inner loop, for each word indexed by i in the outer loop, count the number of consonants in the word.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, word is "Mary".
    - n_consonants is 0, the word "Mary" has 0 consonants.
    - The condition `n_consonants == n` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, word is "had".
    - n_consonants is 0, the word "had" has 0 consonants.
    - The condition `n_consonants == n` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, word is "a".
    - n_consonants is 0, the word "a" has 0 consonants.
    - The condition `n_consonants == n` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, word is "little".
    - n_consonants is 0, the word "little" has 0 consonants.
    - The condition `n_consonants == n` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, word is "lamb".
    - n_consonants is 0, the word "lamb" has 0 consonants.
    - The condition `n_consonants == n` is False, the if branch is not taken.
