[REASONING]
The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a new list of floating-point numbers that have been rescaled to the unit interval [0, 1].
To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9], we need to follow these steps:
1. Calculate the minimum and maximum values in the input list: min_number = 2.0, max_number = 49.9.
2. Calculate the rescaled values by subtracting the minimum value from each input number and then dividing by the range of the input values (max_number - min_number): [(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number) for x in [2.0, 49.9]] = [(2.0 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0), (49.9 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0)] = [0.0, 1.0].
Therefore, the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [2.0, 49.9] is [0.0, 1.0].
