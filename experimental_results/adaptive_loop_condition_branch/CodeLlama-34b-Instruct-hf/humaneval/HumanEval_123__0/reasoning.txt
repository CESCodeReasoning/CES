The function `get_odd_collatz` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, a list `odd_collatz` is initialized to an empty list.
The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
The while loop iterates once.
    - `n` is 1.
    - `n` is greater than 1.
    - `n` is odd.
    - `n` is appended to `odd_collatz`.
After the loop completes, the function returns the sorted list `odd_collatz`, which is now [1].
