The function decimal_to_binary takes an integer decimal as input and returns a string that represents the binary representation of the input.
The function first concatenates the string "db" with the binary representation of the input, which is obtained using the bin() function.
The bin() function returns a string that starts with "0b", so we need to remove the first two characters by slicing the string from index 2 to the end.
Finally, the function concatenates the resulting string with another "db" to form the final output.
Therefore, the output of executing the function decimal_to_binary on the input 0 is "db0db".
