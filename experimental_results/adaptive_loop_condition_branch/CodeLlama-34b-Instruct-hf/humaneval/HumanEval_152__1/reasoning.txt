The function compare takes two lists as input, game and guess. It returns a new list containing the absolute difference between each element of game and guess.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input [0,0,0,0,0,0] and [0,0,0,0,0,0], we need to calculate the absolute difference between each element of the two lists.
Since both lists are the same, the absolute difference between each element is 0. Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input [0,0,0,0,0,0] and [0,0,0,0,0,0] is [0,0,0,0,0,0].
