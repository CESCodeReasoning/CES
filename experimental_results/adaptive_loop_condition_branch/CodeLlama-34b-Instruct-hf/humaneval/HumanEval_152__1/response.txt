<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def compare(game, guess):
    return [abs(x - y) for x, y in zip(game, guess)]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
compare([0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0])
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
[REASONING]
The function compare takes two lists as input, game and guess. It returns a new list containing the absolute difference between each element of game and guess.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input [0,0,0,0,0,0] and [0,0,0,0,0,0], we need to calculate the absolute difference between each element of the two lists.
Since both lists are the same, the absolute difference between each element is 0. Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input [0,0,0,0,0,0] and [0,0,0,0,0,0] is [0,0,0,0,0,0].
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[/OUTPUT]
[/PYTHON]
