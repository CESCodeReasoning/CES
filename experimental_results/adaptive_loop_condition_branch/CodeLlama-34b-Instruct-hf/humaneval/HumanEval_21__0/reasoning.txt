The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a new list of floating-point numbers that have been rescaled to the unit interval [0, 1].
To determine the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], we need to find the minimum and maximum values in the input list, which are 1.0 and 5.0, respectively.
We then rescale each input number by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the maximum value minus the minimum value.
Therefore, the output of executing the function rescale_to_unit on the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] is [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0].
