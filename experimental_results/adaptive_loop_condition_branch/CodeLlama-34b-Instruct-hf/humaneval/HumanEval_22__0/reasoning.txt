The function filter_integers takes a list of values of any type as input and returns a new list containing only the integers from the original list.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [], we need to iterate through the list and check if each element is an integer.
Since the input list is empty, the output of executing the function filter_integers on the input [] is [].
