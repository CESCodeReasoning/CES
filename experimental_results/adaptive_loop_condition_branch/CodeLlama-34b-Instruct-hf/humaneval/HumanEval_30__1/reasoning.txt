The function get_positive takes a list l as input and returns a new list containing all the elements of l that are greater than 0.
To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2], we need to iterate through the list and check if each element is greater than 0.
Since both elements are less than or equal to 0, the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2] is an empty list.
