<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):

    check = txt.split(' ')[-1]
    return True if len(check) == 1 and (
        97 <= ord(check.lower()) <= 122) else False
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("A")
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    [REASONING]
    The function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter takes a string txt as input and checks if the last character of the string is a letter.
    To determine if the last character is a letter, the function first splits the string into a list of words using the split() method with a space as the separator.
    It then takes the last word in the list using the [-1] index and checks its length. If the length is 1, it means the word is a single character, and the function checks if the character is a letter by converting it to lowercase and checking if its ASCII code is between 97 and 122 inclusive. If all the conditions are met, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.
    [/REASONING]
    return True if len(txt.split(' ')[-1]) == 1 and (
        97 <= ord(txt.split(' ')[-1].lower()) <= 122) else False
