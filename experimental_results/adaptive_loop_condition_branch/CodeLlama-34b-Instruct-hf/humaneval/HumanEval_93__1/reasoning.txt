The function encode takes a string message as input and performs the following operations:
1. It creates a dictionary vowels_replace that maps each vowel to its corresponding ASCII code plus 2.
2. It swaps the case of the input message.
3. It iterates over each character in the message and replaces it with the corresponding value in vowels_replace if it is a vowel, or leaves it unchanged if it is not a vowel.
4. It returns the encoded message.
