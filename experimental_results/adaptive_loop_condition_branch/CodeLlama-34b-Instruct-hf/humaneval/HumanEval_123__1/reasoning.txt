The function `get_odd_collatz` is called with ( n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_collatz` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 5 through 16 (since ( n = 5 )).
First Iteration (n = 5):
    - n > 1 when n=5
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is true. The second branch is taken.
    -`odd_collatz.append(int(n))` updates `odd_collatz` to [5].
Second Iteration (n = 16):
    - n > 1 when n=16
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`n = n / 2` updates `n` to 8 ( 16 / 2 = 8 ).
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is false. The second branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (n = 8):
    - n > 1 when n=8
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`n = n / 2` updates `n` to 4 ( 8 / 2 = 4 ).
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is false. The second branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (n = 4)
    - n > 1 when n=4
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`n = n / 2` updates `n` to 2 ( 4 / 2 = 2 ).
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is false. The second branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (n = 2)
    - n > 1 when n=2
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    -`n = n / 2` updates `n` to 1 ( 2 / 2 = 1 ).
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is false. The second branch is not taken.
Sixth Iteration (n = 1)
    - n > 1 when n=1
    - The condition `n % 2 == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `n % 2 == 1` is true. The second branch is taken.
    -`odd_collatz.append(int(n))` updates `odd_collatz` to [5, 1].
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `odd_collatz`, which is now [5, 1].
