The function `can_arrange` is called with (arr = [4,8,5,7,3]).
Inside the function, a variable `ind` is initialized to -1.
The loop iterates from 1 through 4 (since (len(arr) = 5)).
First Iteration (i = 1):
    - i < 5 when i=1
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    - i < 5 when i=2
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    - i < 5 when i=3
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `ind` is updated to 3 ( -1 + 3 = 2 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    - i < 5 when i=4
    - The condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false. The first branch is not taken.
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is now 3.
