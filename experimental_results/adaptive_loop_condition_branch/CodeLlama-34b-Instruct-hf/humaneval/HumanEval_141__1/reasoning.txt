The function `file_name_check` is called with (file_name = '@this1_is6_valid.exe').
The function splits the file name into a list using the '.' character as the separator.
The length of the list is checked, and if it is not equal to 2, the function returns 'No'.
The second element of the list (i.e., the file extension) is checked to see if it is in the list of allowed extensions (['txt', 'exe', 'dll']). If it is not, the function returns 'No'.
The first element of the list (i.e., the file name without the extension) is checked to see if it is empty. If it is, the function returns 'No'.
The first character of the file name is checked to see if it is a letter. If it is not, the function returns 'No'.
The number of digits in the file name is counted and if it is greater than 3, the function returns 'No'.
If all the above conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.
