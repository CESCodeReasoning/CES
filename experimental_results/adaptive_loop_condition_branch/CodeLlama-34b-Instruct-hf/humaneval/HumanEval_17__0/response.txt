<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    note_map = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}
    return [note_map[x] for x in music_string.split(' ') if x]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
parse_music('o| .| o| .| o o| o o|')
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
[REASONING]
The function parse_music takes a string representing a musical sequence as input and returns a list of integers representing the notes in the sequence.
To determine the output of executing the function parse_music on the input 'o| .| o| .| o o| o o|', we need to follow these steps:

1. Split the input string into individual notes using the ' ' character as the delimiter. This gives us a list of strings ['o|', '.|', 'o|', '.|', 'o', 'o|', 'o', 'o|'].
2. Create a dictionary called note_map that maps each note to its corresponding integer value. In this case, the dictionary is {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}.
3. Use a list comprehension to create a new list that contains the integer value of each note in the input sequence. We do this by iterating over the list of notes and looking up each note in the note_map dictionary.
4. Return the new list of integers as the output of the function.

Therefore, the output of executing the function parse_music on the input 'o| .| o| .| o o| o o|' is [2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 2].
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
[2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 2]
[/OUTPUT]
