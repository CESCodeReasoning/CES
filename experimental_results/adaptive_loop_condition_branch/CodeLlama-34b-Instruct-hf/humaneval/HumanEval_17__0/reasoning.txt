The function parse_music takes a string representing a musical sequence as input and returns a list of integers representing the notes in the sequence.
To determine the output of executing the function parse_music on the input 'o| .| o| .| o o| o o|', we need to follow these steps:

1. Split the input string into individual notes using the ' ' character as the delimiter. This gives us a list of strings ['o|', '.|', 'o|', '.|', 'o', 'o|', 'o', 'o|'].
2. Create a dictionary called note_map that maps each note to its corresponding integer value. In this case, the dictionary is {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}.
3. Use a list comprehension to create a new list that contains the integer value of each note in the input sequence. We do this by iterating over the list of notes and looking up each note in the note_map dictionary.
4. Return the new list of integers as the output of the function.

Therefore, the output of executing the function parse_music on the input 'o| .| o| .| o o| o o|' is [2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 2].
