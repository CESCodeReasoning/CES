The function `sort_even` is called with ( l = [1, 2, 3] ).
Inside the function, two variables `evens` and `odds` are created.
`evens` is assigned to the even-indexed elements of `l` (i.e., [2, 3] ), and `odds` is assigned to the odd-indexed elements of `l` (i.e., [1] ).
The `sort` method is called on `evens` to sort the even-indexed elements in ascending order.
The `zip` function is used to iterate over the sorted `evens` and `odds` lists simultaneously.
The `extend` method is used to add the sorted even-indexed elements and odd-indexed elements to the `ans` list.
If the length of `evens` is greater than the length of `odds`, the last element of `evens` is appended to `ans`.
Finally, `ans` is returned as the output.
