The function `sum_squares` is called with (lst = [1, 2, 3] ).
Inside the function, a variable `squared` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the elements of `lst`.
First Iteration (i = 1):
    `squared += math.ceil(i)**2` updates `squared` to 1 ( 0 + 1^2 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    `squared += math.ceil(i)**2` updates `squared` to 5 ( 1 + 2^2 = 5 ).
Third Iteration (i = 3)
    `squared += math.ceil(i)**2` updates `squared` to 14 ( 5 + 3^2 = 14 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `squared`, which is now 14.
