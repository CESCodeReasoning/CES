The function compare takes two lists as input, game and guess. It returns a new list containing the absolute difference between each element of game and guess.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input [1,2,3,5] and [-1,2,3,4], we need to calculate the absolute difference between each element of the two lists.
Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input [1,2,3,5] and [-1,2,3,4] is [2, 0, 0, 1].
