The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and returns a boolean value.
To determine the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 4, we need to evaluate the expression n%2 == 0 and n >= 8.
The expression n%2 == 0 checks if n is even, and the expression n >= 8 checks if n is greater than or equal to 8.
Since 4 is not even and it is less than 8, the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 4 is False.
