<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    return n%2 == 0 and n >= 8
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
is_equal_to_sum_even(4) 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    return n%2 == 0 and n >= 8
[/PYTHON]
[REASONING]
The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input and returns a boolean value.
To determine the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 4, we need to evaluate the expression n%2 == 0 and n >= 8.
The expression n%2 == 0 checks if n is even, and the expression n >= 8 checks if n is greater than or equal to 8.
Since 4 is not even and it is less than 8, the output of executing the function is_equal_to_sum_even on the input 4 is False.
[/REASONING]
[OUTPUT]
False
[/OUTPUT]</s>
