The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [12345, 2033, 111, 151] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_digit_elements` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The element `12345` is not all odd digits, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 2:
    -The element `2033` is not all odd digits, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 3:
    -The element `111` is all odd digits, so it is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 4:
    -The element `151` is not all odd digits, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.

Finally, the function returns the sorted list `odd_digit_elements`, which contains only the element `111`.
