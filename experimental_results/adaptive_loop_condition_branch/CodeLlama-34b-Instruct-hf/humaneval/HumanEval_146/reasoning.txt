The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [5, -2, 1, -5] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The element `5` is greater than 10, so the condition `num > 10` is true.
    -The first digit of `5` is `5`, which is an odd number.
    -The last digit of `5` is `5`, which is an odd number.
    -The variable `count` is incremented by 1.

Iteration 2:
    -The element `-2` is not greater than 10, so the condition `num > 10` is false.
    -The first digit of `-2` is `-`, which is not an odd number.
    -The last digit of `-2` is `-`, which is not an odd number.
    -The variable `count` is not incremented.

Iteration 3:
    -The element `1` is greater than 10, so the condition `num > 10` is true.
    -The first digit of `1` is `1`, which is an odd number.
    -The last digit of `1` is `1`, which is an odd number.
    -The variable `count` is incremented by 1.

Iteration 4:
    -The element `-5` is not greater than 10, so the condition `num > 10` is false.
    -The first digit of `-5` is `-`, which is not an odd number.
    -The last digit of `-5` is `-`, which is not an odd number.
    -The variable `count` is not incremented.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `count`, which is 2.
