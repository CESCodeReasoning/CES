The function `Strongest_Extension` is called with ( class_name = 'finNNalLLly', extensions = ['Die', 'NowW', 'Wow', 'WoW'] ).
Inside the function, a variable `strong` is initialized to the first element of `extensions`.

Iteration 1:
    - `s` is 'Die', which is not the strongest extension yet.
    - `val` is 0, since there are no uppercase letters in 'Die'.
    - The condition `val > my_val` is false, since `my_val` is 0.
    - The `else` block is not executed.
Iteration 2:
    - `s` is 'NowW', which is not the strongest extension yet.
    - `val` is 0, since there are no uppercase letters in 'NowW'.
    - The condition `val > my_val` is false, since `my_val` is 0.
    - The `else` block is not executed.
Iteration 3:
    - `s` is 'Wow', which is the strongest extension so far.
    - `val` is 1, since there is one uppercase letter in 'Wow'.
    - The condition `val > my_val` is true, since `my_val` is 0.
    - The `else` block is executed, and `strong` is updated to 'Wow'.
Iteration 4:
    - `s` is 'WoW', which is not the strongest extension yet.
    - `val` is 0, since there are no uppercase letters in 'WoW'.
    - The condition `val > my_val` is false, since `my_val` is 1.
    - The `else` block is not executed.
