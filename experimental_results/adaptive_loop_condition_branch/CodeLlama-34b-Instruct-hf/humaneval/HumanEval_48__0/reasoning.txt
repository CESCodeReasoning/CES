The function `is_palindrome` is called with ( text = "xywzx" ).
Inside the function, a loop iterates over the length of the input string.

Iteration 1:
    - `i` is 0, and `text[i]` is 'x'.
    - `text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is 'x', since `len(text)` is 5 and `i` is 0.
    - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is false, since 'x' is equal to 'x'.
    - The function continues to the next iteration.
Iteration 2:
    - `i` is 1, and `text[i]` is 'y'.
    - `text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is 'w', since `len(text)` is 5 and `i` is 1.
    - The condition `text[i] != text[len(text) - 1 - i]` is true, since 'y' is not equal to 'w'.
    - The function returns False.
