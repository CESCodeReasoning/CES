<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def next_smallest(lst):
    lst = sorted(set(lst))
    return None if len(lst) < 2 else lst[1]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
next_smallest([])
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
def next_smallest(lst):
    [REASONING]
    The function next_smallest takes a list lst as input.
    It first sorts the list and converts it into a set to remove any duplicates.
    Then, it checks if the length of the sorted list is less than 2. If it is, it returns None.
    Otherwise, it returns the second element of the sorted list.
    [/REASONING]
    lst = sorted(set(lst))
    return None if len(lst) < 2 else lst[1]
[/PYTHON]
[TESTS]
# Test case 1:
assert next_smallest([]) == None
# Test case 2:
assert next_smallest([1]) == None
# Test case 3:
assert next_smallest([1, 2, 3]) == 2
# Test case 4:
assert next_smallest([1, 2, 2, 3]) == 2
# Test case 5:
assert next_smallest([1, 1, 2, 3]) == 2
