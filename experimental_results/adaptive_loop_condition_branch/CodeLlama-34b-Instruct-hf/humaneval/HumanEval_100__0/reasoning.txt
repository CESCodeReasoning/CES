The function make_a_pile takes an integer n as input and returns a list of length n, where each element is calculated by taking the sum of n and 2 times the index of the element.
To determine the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 4, we need to calculate the list [4 + 2 * 0, 4 + 2 * 1, 4 + 2 * 2, 4 + 2 * 3].
Therefore, the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 4 is [4, 6, 8, 10].
