The function `fibfib` is called with ( n = 10 ).
Inside the function, the first condition `n == 0` is checked.
Since `n` is 10, this condition is false.
The second condition `n == 1` is checked.
Since `n` is 10, this condition is also false.
The third condition `n == 2` is checked.
Since `n` is 10, this condition is also false.
The fourth condition `n == 3` is checked.
Since `n` is 10, this condition is also false.
The fifth condition `n == 4` is checked.
Since `n` is 10, this condition is also false.
The sixth condition `n == 5` is checked.
Since `n` is 10, this condition is also false.
The seventh condition `n == 6` is checked.
Since `n` is 10, this condition is also false.
The eighth condition `n == 7` is checked.
Since `n` is 10, this condition is also false.
The ninth condition `n == 8` is checked.
Since `n` is 10, this condition is also false.
The tenth condition `n == 9` is checked.
Since `n` is 10, this condition is also false.
The eleventh condition `n == 10` is checked.
Since `n` is 10, this condition is true.
The function returns the value of `fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)`, which is 55.
