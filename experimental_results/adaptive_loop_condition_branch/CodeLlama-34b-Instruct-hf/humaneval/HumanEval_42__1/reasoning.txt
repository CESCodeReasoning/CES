The function incr_list takes a list as input and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1.
To determine the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [], we need to iterate over the elements of the input list and increment each element by 1.
Since the input list is empty, the output of executing the function incr_list on the input [] is [].
