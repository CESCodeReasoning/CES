The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = "[[[[]]]]" ).
Inside the function, two lists `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` are initialized to empty lists.

Iteration 1:
    - `i` is 0, which is less than the length of the string.
    - The character at index 0 is '['.
    - The condition `string[i] == '['` is true.
    - Action: `opening_bracket_index.append(i)` adds the index 0 to the list `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 2:
    - `i` is 1, which is less than the length of the string.
    - The character at index 1 is '['.
    - The condition `string[i] == '['` is true.
    - Action: `opening_bracket_index.append(i)` adds the index 1 to the list `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 3:
    - `i` is 2, which is less than the length of the string.
    - The character at index 2 is '['.
    - The condition `string[i] == '['` is true.
    - Action: `opening_bracket_index.append(i)` adds the index 2 to the list `opening_bracket_index`.
Iteration 4:
    - `i` is 3, which is less than the length of the string.
    - The character at index 3 is ']'.
    - The condition `string[i] == '['` is false.
    - Action: `closing_bracket_index.append(i)` adds the index 3 to the list `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 5:
    - `i` is 4, which is less than the length of the string.
    - The character at index 4 is ']'.
    - The condition `string[i] == '['` is false.
    - Action: `closing_bracket_index.append(i)` adds the index 4 to the list `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 6:
    - `i` is 5, which is less than the length of the string.
    - The character at index 5 is ']'.
    - The condition `string[i] == '['` is false.
    - Action: `closing_bracket_index.append(i)` adds the index 5 to the list `closing_bracket_index`.
Iteration 7:
    - `i` is 6, which is less than the length of the string.
    - The character at index 6 is ']'.
    - The condition `string[i] == '['` is false.
    - Action: `closing_bracket_index.append(i)` adds the index 6 to the list `closing_bracket_index`.

After the loop completes, the list `opening_bracket_index` contains the indices of all the opening brackets in the string, and the list `closing_bracket_index` contains the indices of all the closing brackets in the string.

The list `closing_bracket_index` is then reversed, so that the indices of the closing brackets are in descending order.

The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0.

The variable `i` is initialized to 0.

The variable `l` is initialized to the length of the list `closing_bracket_index`.

The loop iterates over the list `opening_bracket_index`.

Iteration 1:
    - `idx` is 0.
    - `i` is 0.
    - `l` is 4.
    - The condition `i < l` is true.
    - The condition `idx < closing_bracket_index[i]` is true.
    - Action: `cnt += 1` updates `cnt` to 1.
    - Action: `i += 1` updates `i` to 1.
Iteration 2:
    - `idx` is 1.
    - `i` is 1.
    - `l` is 4.
    - The condition `i < l` is true.
    - The condition `idx < closing_bracket_index[i]` is true.
    - Action: `cnt += 1` updates `cnt` to 2.
    - Action: `i += 1` updates `i` to 2.
Iteration 3:
    - `idx` is 2.
    - `i` is 2.
    - `l` is 4.
    - The condition `i < l` is true.
    - The condition `idx < closing_bracket_index[i]` is true.
    - Action: `cnt += 1` updates `cnt` to 3.
    - Action: `i += 1` updates `i` to 3.
Iteration 4:
    - `idx` is 3.
    - `i` is 3.
    - `l` is 4.
    - The condition `i < l` is false.
    - The condition `idx < closing_bracket_index[i]` is false.
    - Action: `cnt += 1` updates `cnt` to 4.
    - Action: `i += 1` updates `i` to 4.

After the loop completes, the variable `cnt` contains the number of nested brackets in the string.

The function returns `cnt >= 2`, which is true if the string contains at least two nested brackets.
