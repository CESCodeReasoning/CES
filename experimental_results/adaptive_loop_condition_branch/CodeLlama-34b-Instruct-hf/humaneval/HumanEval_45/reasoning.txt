The function triangle_area takes two inputs, a and h, which are the base and height of a triangle, respectively. The function returns the area of the triangle, which is calculated by multiplying the base and height and dividing the result by 2.0.
To determine the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (5, 3), we need to multiply 5 and 3 and divide the result by 2.0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function triangle_area on the input (5, 3) is 7.5.
