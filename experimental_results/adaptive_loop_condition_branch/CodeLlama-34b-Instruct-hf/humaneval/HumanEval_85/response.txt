<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def add(lst):
    return sum([lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i]%2 == 0])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
add([4, 88]) 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
def add(lst):
    return sum([lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i]%2 == 0])
[/PYTHON]
[REASONING]
The function add takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88], we need to iterate through the list and sum up all the even numbers.
The first number in the list is 4, which is even, so we add it to the sum.
The second number is 88, which is even, so we add it to the sum as well.
The final output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88] is 92.
[/REASONING]
[OUTPUT]
92
[/OUTPUT]</s>
