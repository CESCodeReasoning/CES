The function add takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88], we need to iterate through the list and sum up all the even numbers.
The first number in the list is 4, which is even, so we add it to the sum.
The second number is 88, which is even, so we add it to the sum as well.
The final output of executing the function add on the input [4, 88] is 92.
