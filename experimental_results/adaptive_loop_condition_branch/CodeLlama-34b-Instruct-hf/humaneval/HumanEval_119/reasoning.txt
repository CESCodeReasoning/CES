The function `match_parens` is called with the input `['()(', ')']`.
Inside the function, the first two elements of the input list are concatenated using the `+` operator, resulting in the string "()(".
The `check` function is called with the string "()(".
Inside the `check` function, the string is iterated over character by character.
The first character is '('. The number of unmatched opening parentheses is incremented to 1.
The second character is ')'. The number of unmatched opening parentheses is decremented to 0.
The third character is '('. The number of unmatched opening parentheses is incremented to 1.
The fourth character is ')'. The number of unmatched opening parentheses is decremented to 0.
Since the number of unmatched opening parentheses is 0 at the end of the iteration, the `check` function returns "Yes".
The `match_parens` function returns "Yes".
