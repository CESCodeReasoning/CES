The function count_distinct_characters takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function on the input 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE', we need to first concatenate the strings.
The resulting string is 'abcdecadeCADE'.
Next, we need to convert the string to lowercase using the string.lower() method.
The resulting string is 'abcdecadecade'.
Finally, we need to count the number of distinct characters in the string using the len() function and the set() function.
The set() function creates a set of unique elements from the string, and the len() function returns the length of the set.
Therefore, the output of executing the function on the input 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' is 5.
