The function find_max takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest string in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "enam", "game"], we need to sort the list of strings in descending order based on their length.
The sorted function in Python can take an optional key argument, which specifies a function to be called on each list element prior to making comparisons.
In this case, the key function is lambda x: (-len(set(x)), x), which first takes the length of the set of unique characters in each string and then the string itself.
The negative sign is used to sort the list in descending order.
Therefore, the output of executing the function find_max on the input ["name", "enam", "game"] is "game".
