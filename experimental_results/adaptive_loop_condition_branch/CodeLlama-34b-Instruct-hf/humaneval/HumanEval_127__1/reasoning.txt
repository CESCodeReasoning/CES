The function `intersection` is called with (interval1 = [-1, 1], interval2 = [0, 4]).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the maximum of `interval1[0]` and `interval2[0]`, which is 0.
A variable `r` is initialized to the minimum of `interval1[1]` and `interval2[1]`, which is 1.
A variable `length` is initialized to `r - l`, which is 1.
The function `is_prime` is called with (num = 1).
Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to 2.
The loop iterates from 2 to `num` (which is 1).
The condition `num % i == 0` is false, so the loop does not execute.
The function `is_prime` returns `True`.
The condition `length > 0 and is_prime(length)` is true, so the function `intersection` returns "YES".
