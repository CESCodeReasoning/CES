The function `triangle_area` is called with ( a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ).
Inside the function, the first condition is checked:
`a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a`
This condition is true, since `1 + 2 <= 3` and `1 + 3 <= 2` and `2 + 3 <= 1`.
Therefore, the if branch is taken and the method returns -1.
