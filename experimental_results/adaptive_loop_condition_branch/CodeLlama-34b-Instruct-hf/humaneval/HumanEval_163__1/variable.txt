def generate_integers(a, b):
    [REASONING]
    The function generate_integers takes two integers a and b as input.
    It first finds the lower and upper bounds of the range of integers to generate.
    The lower bound is the maximum of 2 and the minimum of a and b.
    The upper bound is the minimum of 8 and the maximum of a and b.
    Then it generates a list of integers in the range [lower, upper] that are evenly divisible by 2.
    [/REASONING]
    lower = max(2, min(a, b))
    upper = min(8, max(a, b))

    return [i for i in range(lower, upper + 1) if i % 2 == 0]
