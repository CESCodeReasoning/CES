    The function generate_integers takes two integers a and b as input.
    It first finds the lower and upper bounds of the range of integers to generate.
    The lower bound is the maximum of 2 and the minimum of a and b.
    The upper bound is the minimum of 8 and the maximum of a and b.
    Then it generates a list of integers in the range [lower, upper] that are evenly divisible by 2.
