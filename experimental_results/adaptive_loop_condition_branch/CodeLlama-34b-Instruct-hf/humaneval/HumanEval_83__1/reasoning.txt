The function `starts_one_ends` is called with ( n = 2 ).
`n` is 2, which is not equal to 1.
The condition `n == 1` is false, therefore the if branch is not taken and the method returns 18 * (10 ** (n - 2)).

Therefore, the final output of the function `starts_one_ends(2)` is 18 * (10 ** (2 - 2)) = 18 * 100 = 1800.
