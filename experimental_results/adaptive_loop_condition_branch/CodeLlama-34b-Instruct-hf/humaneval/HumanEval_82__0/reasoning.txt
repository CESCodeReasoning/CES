The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = "Wow" ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the length of `string`.
The length of `string` is 3.

The first condition checks if `l` is equal to 0 or 1.
Since `l` is 3, this condition is false.

The second condition checks if `l` is divisible by 2.
Since 3 is not divisible by 2, this condition is false.

The third condition checks if `l` is divisible by 3.
Since 3 is not divisible by 3, this condition is false.

Since all conditions are false, the function returns `True`.
