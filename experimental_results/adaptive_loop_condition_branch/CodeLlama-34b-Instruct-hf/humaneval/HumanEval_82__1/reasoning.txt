The function `prime_length` is called with ( string = '0' ).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the length of `string`.
Since `string` is a single character, `l` is 1.

The first condition checks if `l` is equal to 0 or 1.
Since `l` is 1, the first condition is true.
The function returns `False`.
