The function multiply takes two integers a and b as input. It first computes the absolute value of a and b by taking the remainder of each with 10. Then, it multiplies the absolute values and returns the result.
To determine the output of executing the function multiply on the input (2020, 1851), we need to follow these steps:
1. Compute the absolute value of 2020 and 1851 by taking the remainder of each with 10.
abs(2020 % 10) = 0
abs(1851 % 10) = 1
2. Multiply the absolute values.
0 * 1 = 0
Therefore, the output of executing the function multiply on the input (2020, 1851) is 0.
