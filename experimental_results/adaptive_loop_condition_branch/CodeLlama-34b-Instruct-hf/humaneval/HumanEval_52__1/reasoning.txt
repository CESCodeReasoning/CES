The function `below_threshold` is called with ( l = [1, 20, 4, 10] ) and ( t = 5 ).
Inside the function, a loop iterates over the elements of `l`.
First Iteration (e = 1)
   - `e` is 1, which is less than `t` (5).
   - The condition `e >= t` is false.
   - Action: `return False` is not executed.
Second Iteration (e = 20)
   - `e` is 20, which is greater than `t` (5).
   - The condition `e >= t` is true.
   - Action: `return False` is executed, and the function returns `False`.
