The function `check_dict_case` is called with ( dict = {"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345" } ).
Inside the function, the length of the dictionary's keys is checked. If it is 0, the function returns False.
Otherwise, the function sets the variable `state` to "start" and iterates through the keys of the dictionary.
For each key, the function checks if it is an instance of the string class. If it is not, the function sets `state` to "mixed" and breaks out of the loop.
If the key is an instance of the string class, the function checks if it is all uppercase or all lowercase. If it is not, the function sets `state` to "mixed" and breaks out of the loop.
If the key is all uppercase, the function sets `state` to "upper". If it is all lowercase, the function sets `state` to "lower".
After iterating through all the keys, the function returns True if `state` is "upper" or "lower", and False otherwise.
