The function `factorize` is called with ( n = 3 * 2 * 3 ).
Inside the function, a list `fact` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 2 through 5 (since ( n = 3 * 2 * 3 )).
First Iteration (i = 2):
    - 2 <= 5 when i=2
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - `i += 1` updates `i` to 3 ( 2 + 1 = 3 ).
Second Iteration (i = 3):
    - 3 <= 5 when i=3
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `fact.append(i)` updates `fact` to [3].
    - `n //= i` updates `n` to 6 ( 18 // 3 = 6 ).
Third Iteration (i = 4):
    - 4 <= 5 when i=4
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - `i += 1` updates `i` to 5 ( 4 + 1 = 5 ).
Fourth Iteration (i = 5):
    - 5 <= 5 when i=5
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `fact.append(i)` updates `fact` to [3, 5].
    - `n //= i` updates `n` to 1 ( 6 // 5 = 1 ).
Fifth Iteration (i = 6):
    - 6 <= 5 when i=6
    - The condition `n % i == 0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - `i += 1` updates `i` to 7 ( 6 + 1 = 7 ).
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `fact`, which is now [3, 5].
