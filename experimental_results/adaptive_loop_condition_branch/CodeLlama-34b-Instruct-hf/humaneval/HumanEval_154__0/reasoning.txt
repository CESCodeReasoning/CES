The function cycpattern_check(a, b) takes two strings as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each character in the first string.
In the inner loop, for each character indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other character that comes after it in the second string.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - a[i]='w': compare with 't', 'i', 'n', 'e', 'm', 't':
        - When j = 1 (a[j]='t'), the condition `a[i] == a[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (a[j]='i'), the condition `a[i] == a[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (a[j]='n'), the condition `a[i] == a[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (a[j]='e'), the condition `a[i] == a[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (a[j]='m'), the condition `a[i] == a[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - a[i]='i': compare with 'n', 'e', 'm', 't':
        - When j = 2 (a[j]='n'), the condition `a[i] == a[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (a[j]='e'), the condition `a[i] == a[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (a[j]='m'), the condition `a[i] == a[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (a[j]='t'), the condition `a[i] == a[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
    - a[i]='n': compare with 'e', 'm', 't':
        - When j = 3 (a[j]='e'), the condition `a[i] == a[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (a[j]='m'), the condition `a[i] == a[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (a[j]='t'), the condition `a[i] == a[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
    - a[i]='e': compare with 'm', 't':
        - When j = 4 (a[j]='m'), the condition `a[i] == a[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (a[j]='t'), the condition `a[i] == a[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - a[i]='m': compare with 't':
        - When j = 5 (a[j]='t'), the condition `a[i] == a[j]` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, j in the inner loop is 6.
    - a[i]='t': compare with 't':
        - When j = 6 (a[j]='t'), the condition `a[i] == a[j]` is True, the if branch is taken.
