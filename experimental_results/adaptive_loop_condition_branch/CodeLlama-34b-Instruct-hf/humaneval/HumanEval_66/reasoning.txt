The function `digitSum` is called with the string "You arE Very Smart".
The first line checks if the input string is empty. If it is, the function returns 0.
Since the input string is not empty, the function proceeds to the next line.
The next line uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string.
For each character, the function checks if it is an uppercase letter using the `isupper()` method. If it is, the function converts the character to its ASCII code using the `ord()` function.
The function then returns the sum of all the ASCII codes of the uppercase letters in the input string.
