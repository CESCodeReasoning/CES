The function right_angle_triangle takes three integers a, b, and c as input. It checks if the input values can form a right-angled triangle.
To determine the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input (7, 24, 25), we need to check if the following conditions are met:

1. a^2 == b^2 + c^2
2. b^2 == a^2 + c^2
3. c^2 == a^2 + b^2

We can see that condition 1 is not met, as 7^2 is not equal to 24^2 + 25^2.
We can also see that condition 2 is not met, as 24^2 is not equal to 7^2 + 25^2.
However, condition 3 is met, as 25^2 is equal to 7^2 + 24^2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function right_angle_triangle on the input (7, 24, 25) is True.
