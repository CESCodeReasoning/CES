The function `prod_signs` is called with an array `arr` containing the values `[-1, 1, 1, 1]`.
The first line of the function checks if the array is empty. If it is, the function returns `None`.
Since the array is not empty, the function continues to the next line.
The next line initializes a variable `prod` to 0 if the array contains 0, or to (-1) raised to the power of the length of the array if it does not contain 0.
The next line filters the array to only include negative values, and then takes the length of the filtered array.
The function then returns the product of `prod` and the sum of the absolute values of the array.
