The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list A, which is a list of integers from 1 to n.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1.
    - A[i]=1: compare with 2, 3, 4, ..., n:
        - When j = 1 (A[j]=2), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (A[j]=3), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (A[j]=4), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - ...
        - When j = n-1 (A[j]=n), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, ..., n-1.
    - A[i]=2: compare with 3, 4, ..., n:
        - When j = 2 (A[j]=3), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (A[j]=4), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - ...
        - When j = n-1 (A[j]=n), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, ..., n-1.
    - A[i]=3: compare with 4, ..., n:
        - When j = 3 (A[j]=4), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - ...
        - When j = n-1 (A[j]=n), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
...
Last Iteration (i=n-1):
    - `i` is n-1, j in the inner loop is n.
    - A[i]=n-1: compare with n:
        - When j = n (A[j]=n), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
