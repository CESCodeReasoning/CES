The function `prod_signs` is called with an array of integers.
The first line checks if the array is empty. If it is, the function returns `None`.
The second line initializes a variable `prod` to 0 if there is a 0 in the array, or to (-1) raised to the power of the number of negative integers in the array.
The third line calculates the product of the absolute values of the integers in the array.
The function returns the product of `prod` and the sum of the absolute values of the integers in the array.
