The function `skjkasdkd` is called with ( lst = [127, 97, 8192] ).
Inside the function, a variable `maxx` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates through the elements of `lst`.
First Iteration (i = 0):
    - `lst[i]` is 127.
    - `maxx` is 0, so the condition `lst[i] > maxx` is true.
    - The function `isPrime` is called with ( n = 127 ).
    - Inside the function `isPrime`, a loop iterates from 2 to the square root of 127 (since ( n = 127 )).
