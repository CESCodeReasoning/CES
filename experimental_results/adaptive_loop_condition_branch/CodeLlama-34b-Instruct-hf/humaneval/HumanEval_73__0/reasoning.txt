The function `smallest_change` is called with ( arr = [1, 4, 2] ).
Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    - `i` is 0, which satisfies ( 0 < len(arr) // 2 ).
    - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true (since `arr[0] = 1` and `arr[len(arr) - 0 - 1] = 2`).
    - Action: `ans += 1` updates `ans` to 1.
Iteration 2:
    - `i` is 1, which still satisfies ( 1 < len(arr) // 2 ).
    - The condition `arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]` is true (since `arr[1] = 4` and `arr[len(arr) - 1 - 1] = 2`).
    - Action: `ans += 1` updates `ans` to 2.

Since `i` is now equal to `len(arr) // 2`, the loop terminates.

Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is now 2.

Therefore, the final output of the function `smallest_change([1, 4, 2])` is 2.
