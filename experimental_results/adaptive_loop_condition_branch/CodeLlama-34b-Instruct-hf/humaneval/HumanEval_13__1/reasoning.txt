The function `greatest_common_divisor` is called with (a = 144, b = 60).
Inside the function, a while loop iterates while `b` is not 0.
First Iteration:
    - `a` = 144, `b` = 60.
    - `a` = 60, `b` = 144 % 60 = 24.
Second Iteration:
    - `a` = 60, `b` = 24.
    - `a` = 24, `b` = 60 % 24 = 0.
The while loop terminates since `b` is now 0.
The function returns the value of `a`, which is now 24.
