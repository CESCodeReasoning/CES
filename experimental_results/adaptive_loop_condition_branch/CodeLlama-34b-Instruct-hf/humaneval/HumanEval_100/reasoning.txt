The function make_a_pile takes an integer n as input and returns a list of length n, where each element is calculated by taking the sum of n and 2 times the index of the element.
To determine the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 3, we need to calculate the list [3 + 2*0, 3 + 2*1, 3 + 2*2].
Therefore, the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 3 is [3, 5, 7].
