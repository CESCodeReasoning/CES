The function `separate_paren_groups` is called with ( paren_string = "(()(())((())))" ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.
A variable `current_string` is also initialized to an empty list.
A variable `current_depth` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The character '(' is encountered.
    -`current_depth` is incremented to 1.
    -`current_string` is updated to `['(']`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character '(' is encountered.
    -`current_depth` is incremented to 2.
    -`current_string` is updated to `['(', '(']`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -`current_depth` is decremented to 1.
    -`current_string` is updated to `['(', '(']`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character '(' is encountered.
    -`current_depth` is incremented to 2.
    -`current_string` is updated to `['(', '(', '(']`.
Iteration 5:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -`current_depth` is decremented to 1.
    -`current_string` is updated to `['(', '(', '(']`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -`current_depth` is decremented to 0.
    -`current_string` is updated to `['(', '(', '(']`.
    -`result` is updated to `['(', '(', '(']`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character '(' is encountered.
    -`current_depth` is incremented to 1.
    -`current_string` is updated to `['(', '(', '(', '(']`.
Iteration 8:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -`current_depth` is decremented to 0.
    -`current_string` is updated to `['(', '(', '(', '(']`.
    -`result` is updated to `['(', '(', '(', '(']`.
Iteration 9:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -`current_depth` is decremented to -1.
    -`current_string` is updated to `['(', '(', '(', '(']`.
    -`result` is updated to `['(', '(', '(', '(']`.
Iteration 10:
    -The character ')' is encountered.
    -`current_depth` is decremented to -2.
    -`current_string` is updated to `['(', '(', '(', '(']`.
    -`result` is updated to `['(', '(', '(', '(']`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `separate_paren_groups("(()(())((())))")` is `['(', '(', '(', '(']`.
