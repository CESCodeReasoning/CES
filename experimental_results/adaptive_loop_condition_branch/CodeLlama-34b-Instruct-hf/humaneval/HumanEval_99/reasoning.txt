The function `closest_integer` is called with the input string "10".
Inside the function, the input string is first checked if it contains a decimal point. Since the input string "10" does not contain a decimal point, the if branch is not taken.
Then, the input string is converted to a float using the `float()` function.
Since the float value of "10" is greater than 0.5, the if branch is taken.
The function returns the ceiling of the float value, which is 10.
