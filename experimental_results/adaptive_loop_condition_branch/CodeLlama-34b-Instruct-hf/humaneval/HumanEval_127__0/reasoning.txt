The function `intersection` is called with (interval1 = [-2, -2], interval2 = [-3, -2]).
Inside the function, a variable `l` is initialized to the maximum of the first elements of `interval1` and `interval2`, which is -2.
A variable `r` is initialized to the minimum of the second elements of `interval1` and `interval2`, which is -2.
A variable `length` is initialized to the difference between `r` and `l`, which is 0.
The function `is_prime` is called with (num = 0).
Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to 2.
The loop iterates from 2 to 0 (since ( num = 0 )).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which is not equal to 1 or 0.
   - The condition `num == 1 or num == 0` is false.
   - The condition `num == 2` is false.
   - The condition `num % i == 0` is false.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which is not equal to 1 or 0.
   - The condition `num == 1 or num == 0` is false.
   - The condition `num == 2` is false.
   - The condition `num % i == 0` is false.
Third Iteration (i = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is equal to 1 or 0.
   - The condition `num == 1 or num == 0` is true.
   - The function returns False.
Return Statement
   - After the function call, the function returns "NO".

Therefore, the final output of the function `intersection([-2, -2], [-3, -2])` is "NO".
