The function `eat` is called with (number = 2, need = 11, remaining = 5).
The condition `need <= remaining` is evaluated.
Since `11` is not less than or equal to `5`, the condition is false.
Therefore, the `else` branch is taken.
The function returns the tuple `[number + remaining, 0]`, which is `[2 + 5, 0]`.
The final output of the function `eat(2, 11, 5)` is `[7, 0]`.
