The function `is_nested` is called with ( string = "[[]]" ).
Inside the function, two lists `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index` are initialized to empty lists.
The loop iterates through the input string.
First Iteration (i = 0)
   - `string[i]` is '['.
   - The condition `string[i] == '['` is true.
   - Action: `opening_bracket_index.append(i)` adds 0 to `opening_bracket_index`.
Second Iteration (i = 1)
   - `string[i]` is '['.
   - The condition `string[i] == '['` is true.
   - Action: `opening_bracket_index.append(i)` adds 1 to `opening_bracket_index`.
Third Iteration (i = 2)
   - `string[i]` is ']'.
   - The condition `string[i] == ']'` is true.
   - Action: `closing_bracket_index.append(i)` adds 2 to `closing_bracket_index`.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3)
   - `string[i]` is ']'.
   - The condition `string[i] == ']'` is true.
   - Action: `closing_bracket_index.append(i)` adds 3 to `closing_bracket_index`.
After the loop completes, `closing_bracket_index` is reversed, resulting in `[3, 2]`.
The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0.
The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
The variable `l` is initialized to the length of `closing_bracket_index`, which is 2.
The loop iterates through `opening_bracket_index`.
First Iteration (idx = 0)
   - `i` is 0, which is less than `l`.
   - `idx` is 0, which is less than `closing_bracket_index[i]` (which is 3).
   - The condition `i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i]` is true.
   - Action: `cnt += 1` updates `cnt` to 1.
   - Action: `i += 1` updates `i` to 1.
Second Iteration (idx = 1)
   - `i` is 1, which is less than `l`.
   - `idx` is 1, which is less than `closing_bracket_index[i]` (which is 2).
   - The condition `i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i]` is true.
   - Action: `cnt += 1` updates `cnt` to 2.
   - Action: `i += 1` updates `i` to 2.
After the loop completes, `cnt` is 2, which is greater than or equal to 2.
Therefore, the final output of the function `is_nested` is `True`.
