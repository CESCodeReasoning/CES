The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list A, which is a list of integers from 1 to n.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by i in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - A[i]=1: compare with 4, 9, 16, 25, 36:
        - When j = 1 (A[j]=4), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 2 (A[j]=9), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (A[j]=16), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (A[j]=25), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (A[j]=36), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - A[i]=4: compare with 9, 16, 25, 36:
        - When j = 2 (A[j]=9), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 3 (A[j]=16), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (A[j]=25), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (A[j]=36), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
    - A[i]=9: compare with 16, 25, 36:
        - When j = 3 (A[j]=16), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 4 (A[j]=25), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (A[j]=36), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
    - A[i]=16: compare with 25, 36:
        - When j = 4 (A[j]=25), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
        - When j = 5 (A[j]=36), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - A[i]=25: compare with 36:
        - When j = 5 (A[j]=36), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, j in the inner loop is 6.
    - A[i]=36: compare with 49:
        - When j = 6 (A[j]=49), the condition `(A[i] + A[j]) % 3 == 0` is False, the if branch is not taken.
