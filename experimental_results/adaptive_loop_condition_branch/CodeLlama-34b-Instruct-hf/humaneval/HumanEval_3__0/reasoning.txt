The function `below_zero` is called with ( operations = [1, 2, -4, 5, 6] ).
Inside the function, a variable `balance` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The value of `op` is 1, so `balance` becomes 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The value of `op` is 2, so `balance` becomes 3.
Iteration 3:
    -The value of `op` is -4, so `balance` becomes -1.
Iteration 4:
    -The value of `op` is 5, so `balance` becomes 4.
Iteration 5:
    -The value of `op` is 6, so `balance` becomes 10.

Since `balance` never becomes less than 0, the function returns False.
