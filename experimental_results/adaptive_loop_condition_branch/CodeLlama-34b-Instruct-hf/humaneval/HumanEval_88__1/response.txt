<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def sort_array(array):
    return [] if len(array) == 0 else sorted(
        array, reverse=(array[0] + array[-1]) % 2 == 0)
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sort_array([5])
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
def sort_array(array):
    return [] if len(array) == 0 else sorted(array, reverse=(array[0] + array[-1]) % 2 == 0)
[/PYTHON]
[REASONING]
The function sort_array takes an array as input and returns a sorted version of the array.
The function first checks if the length of the array is 0, and if so, returns an empty array.
Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order by default.
The sorting is done using the built-in sorted() function in Python.
The reverse parameter is set to True if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, and False otherwise.
Therefore, if the sum of the first and last elements is even, the array will be sorted in descending order.
[/REASONING]
[OUTPUT]
[5]
[/OUTPUT]
[PYTHON]
def sort_array(array):
    return sorted(array, reverse=True) if len(array) % 2 == 0 else sorted(array)

The function first checks if the length of the array is even, and if so, sorts the array in descending order using the built-in sorted() function in Python.
Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order.
Therefore, if the length of the array is even, the array will be sorted in descending order, and if it is odd, it will be sorted in ascending order.

[PYTHON]
def sort_array(array):
    return sorted(array, key=lambda x: x % 2)
[/PYTHON]
[REASONING]
The function sort_array takes an array as input and returns a sorted version of the array.
The function sorts the array using the built-in sorted() function in Python, with a custom key function that maps each element to its remainder when divided by 2.
Therefore, the array will be sorted based on the remainder of each element when divided by 2.
[/REASONING]
