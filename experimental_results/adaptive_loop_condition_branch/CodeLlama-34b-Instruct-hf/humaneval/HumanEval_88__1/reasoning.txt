The function sort_array takes an array as input and returns a sorted version of the array.
The function first checks if the length of the array is 0, and if so, returns an empty array.
Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order by default.
The sorting is done using the built-in sorted() function in Python.
The reverse parameter is set to True if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, and False otherwise.
Therefore, if the sum of the first and last elements is even, the array will be sorted in descending order.
