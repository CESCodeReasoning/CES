Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the code:

1. The code starts by initializing an empty list called `result` and an empty string called `current_string`.
2. The code then iterates over each character in the input string.
3. If the current character is an opening parenthesis, the code increases the `current_depth` variable by 1 and adds the parenthesis to the `current_string`.
4. If the current character is a closing parenthesis, the code decreases the `current_depth` variable by 1 and adds the parenthesis to the `current_string`.
5. If the `current_depth` variable is 0 after the closing parenthesis, the code adds the `current_string` to the `result` list and clears the `current_string`.
6. The code returns the `result` list.
