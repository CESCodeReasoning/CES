The function `get_odd_collatz` is called with ( n = 14 ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_collatz` is initialized to an empty list.
The loop iterates from 14 through 1 (since ( n = 14 )).
First Iteration (n = 14):
    - The condition `n%2==0` is true. The first branch is taken.
    - `odd_collatz` is updated to [14].
Second Iteration (n = 7):
    - The condition `n%2==0` is false. The first branch is not taken.
    - The condition `n%2==1` is true. The second branch is taken.
    - `odd_collatz` is updated to [14, 7].
