The function `x_or_y` is called with ( n = 91, x = 56, y = 129 ).
Inside the function, the first condition `n == 1` is checked.
Since `n` is not equal to 1, the condition is false and the `else` block is executed.
The loop iterates from 2 to 90 (since `n` is 91).
First Iteration (i = 2)
   - `i` is 2, which is not a factor of `n`.
   - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `break` is not executed.
Second Iteration (i = 3)
   - `i` is 3, which is not a factor of `n`.
   - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `break` is not executed.
Third Iteration (i = 4)
   - `i` is 4, which is not a factor of `n`.
   - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `break` is not executed.
...
Fifty-Ninth Iteration (i = 59)
   - `i` is 59, which is not a factor of `n`.
   - The condition `n % i == 0` is false.
   - Action: `break` is not executed.
Sixtieth Iteration (i = 60)
   - `i` is 60, which is a factor of `n`.
   - The condition `n % i == 0` is true.
   - Action: `break` is executed, exiting the loop.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `y`, which is 129.

Therefore, the final output of the function `x_or_y(91, 56, 129)` is 129.
