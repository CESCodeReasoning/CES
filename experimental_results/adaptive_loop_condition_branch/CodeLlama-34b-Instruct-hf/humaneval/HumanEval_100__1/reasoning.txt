The function make_a_pile takes an integer n as input and returns a list of length n, where each element is calculated by taking the sum of n and 2 times the index of the element.
To determine the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 6, we need to calculate the sum of 6 and 2 times the index of each element in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function make_a_pile on the input 6 is [8, 10, 12, 14, 16].
