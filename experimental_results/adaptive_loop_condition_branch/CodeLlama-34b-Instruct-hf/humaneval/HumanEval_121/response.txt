<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def solution(lst):
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx%2==0 and x%2==1])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
solution([5, 8, 7, 1])    
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
def solution(lst):
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx%2==0 and x%2==1])
[/PYTHON]
[TESTS]
# Test case 1:
assert solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) == 5
# Test case 2:
assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 9
# Test case 3:
assert solution([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) == 15
