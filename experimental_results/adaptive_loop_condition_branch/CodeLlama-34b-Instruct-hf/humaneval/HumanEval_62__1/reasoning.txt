The function derivative takes a list of numbers as input and returns the derivative of the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function derivative on the input [3, 2, 1], we need to calculate the derivative of each element in the list.
The derivative of 3 is 0, the derivative of 2 is 0, and the derivative of 1 is 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function derivative on the input [3, 2, 1] is [0, 0, 0].
