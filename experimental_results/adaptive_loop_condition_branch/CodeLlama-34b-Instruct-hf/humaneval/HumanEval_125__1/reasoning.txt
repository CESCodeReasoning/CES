The function `split_words` is called with ( txt = "Hello world,!" ).
The first condition `(" " in txt)` is True, so the first branch is taken.
The function returns the result of `txt.split()`, which is `["Hello", "world,!"]`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `split_words("Hello world,!")` is `["Hello", "world,!"]`.
