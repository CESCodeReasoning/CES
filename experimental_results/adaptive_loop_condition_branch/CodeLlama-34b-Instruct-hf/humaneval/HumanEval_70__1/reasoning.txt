The function `strange_sort_list` is called with ( lst = [111111]).
Inside the function, two variables `res` and `switch` are initialized to an empty list and `True`, respectively.
First Iteration:
    - lst = [111111], min(lst) = 111111, max(lst) = 111111.
    - `res.append(min(lst) if switch else max(lst))` updates `res` to [111111] ( [] + 111111 = [111111] ).
    - `lst.remove(res[-1])` removes the last element of `lst`, which is 111111.
    - `switch` is updated to `not switch`, which is `False`.
Since `lst` is empty, the while loop terminates. The function returns the value of `res`, which is now [111111].
