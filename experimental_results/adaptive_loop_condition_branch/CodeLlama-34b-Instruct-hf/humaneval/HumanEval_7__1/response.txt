<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [x for x in strings if substring in x]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
filter_by_substring(['xxx', 'asd', 'aaaxxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xx')
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
[REASONING]
The function filter_by_substring takes two arguments:

* A list of strings called strings.
* A string called substring.

The function returns a new list containing only the strings from the original list that contain the substring.

To determine the output of executing the function on the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'aaaxxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], we need to check which strings in the list contain the substring 'xx'.

The strings 'xxx', 'aaaxxy', and 'xxxAAA' contain the substring 'xx', so the output of executing the function on the input is ['xxx', 'aaaxxy', 'xxxAAA'].
[/REASONING]
[PYTHON]
[OUTPUT]
['xxx', 'aaaxxy', 'xxxAAA']
[/OUTPUT]
[/PYTHON]
