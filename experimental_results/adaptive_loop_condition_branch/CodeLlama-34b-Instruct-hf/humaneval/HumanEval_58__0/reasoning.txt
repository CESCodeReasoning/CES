The function common(l1, l2) takes two lists as its parameters.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the first list.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by e1 in the outer loop, compare it with every other element in the second list.
First Iteration (e1=4):
    - `e1` is 4, e2 in the inner loop is 3, 2, 4.
    - 4 == 3 is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - 4 == 2 is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - 4 == 4 is True, the if branch is taken. Add 4 to ret.
Second Iteration (e1=3):
    - `e1` is 3, e2 in the inner loop is 2, 4.
    - 3 == 2 is False, the if branch is not taken.
    - 3 == 4 is True, the if branch is taken. Add 3 to ret.
Third Iteration (e1=2):
    - `e1` is 2, e2 in the inner loop is 4.
    - 2 == 4 is False, the if branch is not taken.
Fourth Iteration (e1=8):
    - `e1` is 8, e2 in the inner loop is empty.
    - No more elements to compare.
