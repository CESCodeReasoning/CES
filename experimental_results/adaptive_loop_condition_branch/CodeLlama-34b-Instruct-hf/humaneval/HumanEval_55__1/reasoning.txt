The function `fib` is called with ( n = 11 ).
Inside the function, the first condition `n == 0` is checked.
Since `n` is 11, this condition is false.
The second condition `n == 1` is checked.
Since `n` is 11, this condition is also false.
The function recursively calls itself with `n - 1` and `n - 2`.
The first recursive call returns the result of `fib(10)` and the second recursive call returns the result of `fib(9)`.
The final output of the function is the sum of the two recursive calls.
