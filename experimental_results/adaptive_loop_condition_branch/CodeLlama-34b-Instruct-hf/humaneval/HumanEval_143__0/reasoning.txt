The function words_in_sentence(sentence) takes a sentence as its parameter.
The sentence is split into a list of words using the split() method.
The outer loop iterates through each word in the list.
For each word, the inner loop checks if the word is a prime number.
If the word is a prime number, it is added to the new_lst list.
The new_lst list is returned as a string using the join() method.
