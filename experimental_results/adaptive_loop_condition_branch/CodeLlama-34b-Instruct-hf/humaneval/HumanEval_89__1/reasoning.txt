The function `encrypt` is called with ( s = 'asdfghjkl' ).
Inside the function, a variable `out` is initialized to an empty string.

Iteration 1:
    -The character 'a' is in the string `d`, so the index of 'a' in `d` is found (which is 0).
    -The encrypted character is found by adding 2 * 2 to the index (which is 4).
    -The encrypted character is then found by taking the modulo 26 of the index (which is 0).
    -The encrypted character is then found by indexing into `d` with the modulo index (which is 'a').
    -The encrypted character is then added to `out`.
Iteration 2:
    -The character 's' is in the string `d`, so the index of 's' in `d` is found (which is 18).
    -The encrypted character is found by adding 2 * 2 to the index (which is 20).
    -The encrypted character is then found by taking the modulo 26 of the index (which is 4).
    -The encrypted character is then found by indexing into `d` with the modulo index (which is 'e').
    -The encrypted character is then added to `out`.
Iteration 3:
    -The character 'd' is in the string `d`, so the index of 'd' in `d` is found (which is 3).
    -The encrypted character is found by adding 2 * 2 to the index (which is 6).
    -The encrypted character is then found by taking the modulo 26 of the index (which is 1).
    -The encrypted character is then found by indexing into `d` with the modulo index (which is 'b').
    -The encrypted character is then added to `out`.
Iteration 4:
    -The character 'f' is in the string `d`, so the index of 'f' in `d` is found (which is 5).
    -The encrypted character is found by adding 2 * 2 to the index (which is 8).
    -The encrypted character is then found by taking the modulo 26 of the index (which is 2).
    -The encrypted character is then found by indexing into `d` with the modulo index (which is 'c').
    -The encrypted character is then added to `out`.
Iteration 5:
    -The character 'g' is in the string `d`, so the index of 'g' in `d` is found (which is 6).
    -The encrypted character is found by adding 2 * 2 to the index (which is 10).
    -The encrypted character is then found by taking the modulo 26 of the index (which is 4).
    -The encrypted character is then found by indexing into `d` with the modulo index (which is 'e').
    -The encrypted character is then added to `out`.
Iteration 6:
    -The character 'h' is in the string `d`, so the index of 'h' in `d` is found (which is 7).
    -The encrypted character is found by adding 2 * 2 to the index (which is 12).
    -The encrypted character is then found by taking the modulo 26 of the index (which is 6).
    -The encrypted character is then found by indexing into `d` with the modulo index (which is 'g').
    -The encrypted character is then added to `out`.
Iteration 7:
    -The character 'j' is in the string `d`, so the index of 'j' in `d` is found (which is 9).
    -The encrypted character is found by adding 2 * 2 to the index (which is 16).
    -The encrypted character is then found by taking the modulo 26 of the index (which is 10).
    -The encrypted character is then found by indexing into `d` with the modulo index (which is 'k').
    -The encrypted character is then added to `out`.
Iteration 8:
    -The character 'k' is in the string `d`, so the index of 'k' in `d` is found (which is 10).
    -The encrypted character is found by adding 2 * 2 to the index (which is 18).
    -The encrypted character is then found by taking the modulo 26 of the index (which is 2).
    -The encrypted character is then found by indexing into `d` with the modulo index (which is 'c').
    -The encrypted character is then added to `out`.
Iteration 9:
    -The character 'l' is in the string `d`, so the index of 'l' in `d` is found (which is 11).
    -The encrypted character is found by adding 2 * 2 to the index (which is 22).
    -The encrypted character is then found by taking the modulo 26 of the index (which is 6).
    -The encrypted character is then found by indexing into `d` with the modulo index (which is 'g').
    -The encrypted character is then added to `out`.
