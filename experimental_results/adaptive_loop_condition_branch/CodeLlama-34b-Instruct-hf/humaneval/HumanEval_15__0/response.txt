<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join([str(x) for x in range(n + 1)])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
string_sequence(3)
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join([str(x) for x in range(n + 1)])
[/PYTHON]
[REASONING]
The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string that contains the sequence of numbers from 1 to n, separated by spaces.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3, we need to join the list of strings ['1', '2', '3', '4'] with spaces.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3 is "1 2 3 4".
[/REASONING]
[OUTPUT]
"1 2 3 4"
[/OUTPUT]</s>
