The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input and returns a string that contains the sequence of numbers from 1 to n, separated by spaces.
To determine the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3, we need to join the list of strings ['1', '2', '3', '4'] with spaces.
Therefore, the output of executing the function string_sequence on the input 3 is "1 2 3 4".
