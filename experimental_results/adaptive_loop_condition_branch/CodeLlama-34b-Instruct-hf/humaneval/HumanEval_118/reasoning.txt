The function `get_closest_vowel` is called with ( word = "yogurt" ).
Inside the function, a variable `vowels` is initialized to a set of vowels.
The length of the input string is checked, if it is less than 3, the function returns an empty string.
The function then iterates through the input string starting from the second last character until the first character.
If the current character is a vowel and the previous and next characters are not vowels, the function returns the current character.
If the function reaches the end of the string without finding a suitable vowel, it returns an empty string.
