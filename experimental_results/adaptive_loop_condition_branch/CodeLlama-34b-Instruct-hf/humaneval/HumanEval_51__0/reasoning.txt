The function remove_vowels takes a string text as input and returns a new string with all the vowels removed.
To determine the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input "", we need to iterate through each character in the input string and check if it is a vowel.
If the character is a vowel, it is not included in the new string.
Otherwise, it is included in the new string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function remove_vowels on the input "" is "".
