The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input and returns a new string with the same letters as s, but with the letters in each word sorted alphabetically.
To determine the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input 'Hi', we need to split the string into words, sort the letters in each word, and then join the words back together.
Therefore, the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input 'Hi' is 'Hi'.
