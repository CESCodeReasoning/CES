<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def anti_shuffle(s):
    return ' '.join([''.join(sorted(list(i))) for i in s.split(' ')])
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
anti_shuffle('Hi') 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
def anti_shuffle(s):
    return ' '.join([''.join(sorted(list(i))) for i in s.split(' ')])
[/PYTHON]
[REASONING]
The function anti_shuffle takes a string s as input and returns a new string with the same letters as s, but with the letters in each word sorted alphabetically.
To determine the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input 'Hi', we need to split the string into words, sort the letters in each word, and then join the words back together.
Therefore, the output of executing the function anti_shuffle on the input 'Hi' is 'Hi'.
[/REASONING]
[OUTPUT]
'Hi'
[/OUTPUT]</s>
