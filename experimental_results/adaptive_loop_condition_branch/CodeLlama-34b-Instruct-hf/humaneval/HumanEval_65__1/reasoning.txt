The function `circular_shift` is called with ( x = 12, shift = 1 ).
The function first converts the integer `x` to a string `s`.
The function then checks if `shift` is greater than the length of `s`.
If `shift` is greater than the length of `s`, the function returns the string `s` in reverse order.
Otherwise, the function returns the substring of `s` starting from the index `len(s) - shift` to the end of the string, followed by the substring of `s` starting from the beginning of the string to the index `len(s) - shift`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `circular_shift(12, 1)` is "21".
