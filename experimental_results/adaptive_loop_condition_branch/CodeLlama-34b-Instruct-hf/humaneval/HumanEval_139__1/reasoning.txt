The function `special_factorial` is called with (n = 5).
Inside the function, two variables `fact_i` and `special_fact` are initialized to 1.
`range(1, n + 1)` = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] since there are 5 elements in the range.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5.

First Iteration (i = 1):
    `fact_i` = 1 * 1 = 1
    `special_fact` = 1 * 1 = 1
Second Iteration (i = 2):
    `fact_i` = 1 * 2 = 2
    `special_fact` = 1 * 2 = 2
Third Iteration (i = 3):
    `fact_i` = 2 * 3 = 6
    `special_fact` = 2 * 6 = 12
Fourth Iteration (i = 4):
    `fact_i` = 6 * 4 = 24
    `special_fact` = 12 * 24 = 288
Fifth Iteration (i = 5):
    `fact_i` = 24 * 5 = 120
    `special_fact` = 288 * 120 = 34560
After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `special_fact`, which is now 34560.
