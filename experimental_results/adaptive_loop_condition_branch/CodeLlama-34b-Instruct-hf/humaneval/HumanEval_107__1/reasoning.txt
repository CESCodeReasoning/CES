The function `even_odd_palindrome` is called with ( n = 1 ).
Inside the function, two variables `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The variable `i` is 1, which satisfies ( i % 2 == 1 ).
    -The condition `is_palindrome(i)` is false (since 1 is not a palindrome).
    -The `else` block is not executed.

Return Statement
    -After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count`, which are both 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `even_odd_palindrome(1)` is (0, 0).
