[REASONING]
The function filter_by_prefix takes two inputs: a list of strings and a prefix string. It returns a new list containing only the strings from the original list that start with the prefix.
To determine the output of executing the function filter_by_prefix on the input [], we need to check if any of the strings in the list start with the prefix "john". Since the list is empty, there are no strings that start with "john", so the output is an empty list.
