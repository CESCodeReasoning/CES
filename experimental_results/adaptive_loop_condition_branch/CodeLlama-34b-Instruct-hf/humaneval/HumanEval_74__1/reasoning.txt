The function `total_match` is called with ( lst1 = ['hi', 'admin'], lst2 = ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project'] ).
Inside the function, two variables `l1` and `l2` are initialized to 0.
The first loop iterates through the elements of `lst1`.
First Iteration (st = 'hi'):
    `l1 += len(st)` updates `l1` to 2 ( 0 + 2 = 2 ).
Second Iteration (st = 'admin'):
    `l1 += len(st)` updates `l1` to 6 ( 2 + 4 = 6 ).
After the first loop completes, `l1` is 6.
The second loop iterates through the elements of `lst2`.
First Iteration (st = 'hi'):
    `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 2 ( 0 + 2 = 2 ).
Second Iteration (st = 'hi'):
    `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 4 ( 2 + 2 = 4 ).
Third Iteration (st = 'admin'):
    `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 8 ( 4 + 4 = 8 ).
Fourth Iteration (st = 'project'):
    `l2 += len(st)` updates `l2` to 14 ( 8 + 6 = 14 ).
After the second loop completes, `l2` is 14.
The condition ( l1 <= l2 ) is not satisfied, therefore the if branch is not taken and the function returns `lst2` as the output.
