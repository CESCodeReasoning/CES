The function `f` takes an integer `n` as its parameter.
The outer loop iterates through each element in the list to compare it against the others.
In the inner loop, for each element indexed by `i` in the outer loop, compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list.
First Iteration (i=0):
    - `i` is 0, j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - i % 2 == 0: False, the if branch is not taken.
    - x = 0:
        - j in the inner loop is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
        - x += j: x = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
    - ret += [x]: ret = [15]
Second Iteration (i=1):
    - `i` is 1, j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    - i % 2 == 0: True, the if branch is taken.
    - x = 1:
        - j in the inner loop is 2, 3, 4 and 5.
        - x *= j: x = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
    - ret += [x]: ret = [15, 120]
Third Iteration (i=2):
    - `i` is 2, j in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
    - i % 2 == 0: False, the if branch is not taken.
    - x = 0:
        - j in the inner loop is 3, 4 and 5.
        - x += j: x = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12
    - ret += [x]: ret = [15, 120, 12]
Forth Iteration (i=3):
    - `i` is 3, j in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
    - i % 2 == 0: True, the if branch is taken.
    - x = 1:
        - j in the inner loop is 4 and 5.
        - x *= j: x = 1 * 4 * 5 = 20
    - ret += [x]: ret = [15, 120, 12, 20]
Fifth Iteration (i=4):
    - `i` is 4, j in the inner loop is 5.
    - i % 2 == 0: False, the if branch is not taken.
    - x = 0:
        - j in the inner loop is 5.
        - x += j: x = 5
    - ret += [x]: ret = [15, 120, 12, 20, 5]
Sixth iteration (i=5):
    - `i` is 5, j in the inner loop is 6.
    - i % 2 == 0: True, the if branch is taken.
    - x = 1:
        - j in the inner loop is 6.
        - x *= j: x = 1 * 6 = 6
    - ret += [x]: ret = [15, 120, 12, 20, 5, 6]
