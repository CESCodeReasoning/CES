The function `digits` is called with ( n = 5576543 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1.
A variable `odd_count` is initialized to 0.

The loop iterates through each digit in the string representation of `n`.
First Iteration (digit = '5')
   - `digit` is '5', which is an odd number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product` is updated to 5 (`1 * 5 = 5`).
   - `odd_count` is updated to 1.
Second Iteration (digit = '5')
   - `digit` is '5', which is an odd number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product` is updated to 25 (`5 * 5 = 25`).
   - `odd_count` is updated to 2.
Third Iteration (digit = '7')
   - `digit` is '7', which is an odd number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product` is updated to 175 (`25 * 7 = 175`).
   - `odd_count` is updated to 3.
Fourth Iteration (digit = '6')
   - `digit` is '6', which is an even number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `product` remains unchanged.
   - `odd_count` remains unchanged.
Fifth Iteration (digit = '5')
   - `digit` is '5', which is an odd number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product` is updated to 875 (`175 * 5 = 875`).
   - `odd_count` is updated to 4.
Sixth Iteration (digit = '4')
   - `digit` is '4', which is an even number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `product` remains unchanged.
   - `odd_count` remains unchanged.
Seventh Iteration (digit = '3')
   - `digit` is '3', which is an odd number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product` is updated to 2625 (`875 * 3 = 2625`).
   - `odd_count` is updated to 5.

After the loop completes, the function checks if `odd_count` is 0.
Since `odd_count` is 5, the `else` block is executed.
The function returns `product`, which is 2625.
