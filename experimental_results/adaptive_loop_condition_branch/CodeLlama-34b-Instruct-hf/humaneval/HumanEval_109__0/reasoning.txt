The function `move_one_ball` is called with ( arr = [4, 3, 1, 2] ).
Inside the function, the length of the array is checked. If it is 0, the function returns True.
Since the length of the array is 4, the function continues.
The array is sorted and the minimum value is found.
The minimum value is 1, and its index is 2.
The array is rearranged so that the minimum value is at the end.
The function then iterates through the array and checks if each element is in the correct position.
Since the array is already sorted, all elements are in the correct position, and the function returns True.
