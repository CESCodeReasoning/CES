The function `specialFilter` is called with ( nums = [1] ).
Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The number `1` is not greater than 10, so the condition `num > 10` is false.
    -The `else` block is not executed.

Return Statement
    -After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `count`, which is still 0.

Therefore, the final output of the function `specialFilter([1])` is 0.
