The function `vowels_count` is called with ( s = "bYe" ).
Inside the function, a variable `vowels` is initialized to "aeiouAEIOU".
A variable `n_vowels` is initialized to the sum of 1 for each character in `s` that is in `vowels`.
The if statement checks if the last character of `s` is 'y' or 'Y'.
If the condition is true, the if branch is taken and `n_vowels` is incremented by 1.
The function returns `n_vowels`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `vowels_count("bYe")` is 2.
