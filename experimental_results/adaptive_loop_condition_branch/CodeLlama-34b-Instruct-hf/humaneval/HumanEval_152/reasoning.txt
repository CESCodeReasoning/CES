The function compare takes two lists as input, game and guess. It returns a new list containing the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of game and guess.
To determine the output of executing the function compare on the input [1,2,3,4,5,1] and [1,2,3,4,2,-2], we need to calculate the absolute difference between each pair of corresponding elements.
Therefore, the output of executing the function compare on the input [1,2,3,4,5,1] and [1,2,3,4,2,-2] is [0,0,0,0,3,3].
