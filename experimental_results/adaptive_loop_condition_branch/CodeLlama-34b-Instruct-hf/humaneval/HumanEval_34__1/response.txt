<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *


def unique(l: list):
    return sorted(list(set(l)))
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
unique([2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1])
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
def unique(my_list):
    return sorted(list(set(my_list)))
[/PYTHON]
[REASONING]
The function unique takes a list as input and returns a sorted list with all duplicate elements removed.
To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1], we need to first convert the list to a set to remove all duplicate elements.
Then, we convert the set back to a list and sort it.
Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1] is [1, 2].
[/REASONING]
[OUTPUT]
[1, 2]
[/OUTPUT]</s>
