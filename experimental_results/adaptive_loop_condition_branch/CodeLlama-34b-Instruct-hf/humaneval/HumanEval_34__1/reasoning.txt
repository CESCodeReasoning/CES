The function unique takes a list as input and returns a sorted list with all duplicate elements removed.
To determine the output of executing the function unique on the input [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1], we need to first convert the list to a set to remove all duplicate elements.
Then, we convert the set back to a list and sort it.
Therefore, the output of executing the function unique on the input [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1] is [1, 2].
