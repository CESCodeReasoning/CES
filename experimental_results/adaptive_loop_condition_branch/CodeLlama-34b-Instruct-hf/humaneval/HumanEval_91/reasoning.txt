The function is_bored takes a string S as input and returns the number of sentences in S that start with "I ".
To determine the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "Hello world", we need to split the input string into sentences using the regular expression pattern [.?!]\s*.
The resulting list of sentences is ["Hello world"].
Since the first word of the only sentence in the list is not "I ", the output of executing the function is_bored on the input "Hello world" is 0.
