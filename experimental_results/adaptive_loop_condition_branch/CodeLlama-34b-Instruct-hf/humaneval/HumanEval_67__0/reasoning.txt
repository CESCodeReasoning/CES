The function `fruit_distribution` is called with ( s = "2 apples and 3 oranges", n = 5 ).
Inside the function, a list `lis` is initialized to an empty list.
The string `s` is split into a list of words using the `split` method.
The loop iterates over the list of words.
First Iteration (i = "2")
   - `i` is a string, which satisfies `i.isdigit()`.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is true.
   - Action: `lis.append(int(i))` appends the integer 2 to the list `lis`.
Second Iteration (i = "apples")
   - `i` is a string, but does not satisfy `i.isdigit()`.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - Action: `lis.append(int(i))` does not execute.
Third Iteration (i = "and")
   - `i` is a string, but does not satisfy `i.isdigit()`.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - Action: `lis.append(int(i))` does not execute.
Fourth Iteration (i = "3")
   - `i` is a string, which satisfies `i.isdigit()`.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is true.
   - Action: `lis.append(int(i))` appends the integer 3 to the list `lis`.
Fifth Iteration (i = "oranges")
   - `i` is a string, but does not satisfy `i.isdigit()`.
   - The condition `i.isdigit()` is false.
   - Action: `lis.append(int(i))` does not execute.
Return Statement
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `n - sum(lis)`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 5)` is 5 - (2 + 3) = 0.
