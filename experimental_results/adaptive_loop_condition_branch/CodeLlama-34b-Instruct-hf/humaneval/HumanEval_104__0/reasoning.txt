The function `unique_digits` is called with ( x = [135, 103, 31] ).
Inside the function, a variable `odd_digit_elements` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    -The element `135` is not all odd digits, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 2:
    -The element `103` is not all odd digits, so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
Iteration 3:
    -The element `31` is all odd digits, so it is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the sorted list `odd_digit_elements`, which is now [31].

Therefore, the final output of the function `unique_digits([135, 103, 31])` is [31].
