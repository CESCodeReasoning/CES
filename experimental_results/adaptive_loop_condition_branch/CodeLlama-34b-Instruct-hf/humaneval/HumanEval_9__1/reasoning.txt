The function `rolling_max` is called with ( numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] ).
Inside the function, a variable `running_max` is initialized to `None`.
A variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.

Iteration 1:
    - `n` is 1, which is less than `running_max` (which is `None`).
    - The condition `running_max is None` is true.
    - Action: `running_max` is set to 1.
    - Action: 1 is appended to `result`.
Iteration 2:
    - `n` is 2, which is less than `running_max` (which is 1).
    - The condition `running_max is None` is false.
    - Action: `running_max` is set to `max(running_max, n)`, which is `max(1, 2)`, which is 2.
    - Action: 2 is appended to `result`.
Iteration 3:
    - `n` is 3, which is less than `running_max` (which is 2).
    - The condition `running_max is None` is false.
    - Action: `running_max` is set to `max(running_max, n)`, which is `max(2, 3)`, which is 3.
    - Action: 3 is appended to `result`.
Iteration 4:
    - `n` is 4, which is less than `running_max` (which is 3).
    - The condition `running_max is None` is false.
    - Action: `running_max` is set to `max(running_max, n)`, which is `max(3, 4)`, which is 4.
    - Action: 4 is appended to `result`.

Therefore, the final output of the function `rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 4])` is [1, 2, 3, 4].
