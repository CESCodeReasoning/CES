The function `intersperse` is called with ( numbers = [5, 6, 3, 2], delimeter = 8 ).
Inside the function, a variable `result` is initialized to an empty list.
The condition ( not numbers ) is evaluated to `True` since `numbers` is not an empty list.
The loop iterates from 0 through 2 (since ( len(numbers) = 3 )).
First Iteration (n = 5):
    `result.append(n)` updates `result` to [5].
    `result.append(delimeter)` updates `result` to [5, 8].
Second Iteration (n = 6):
    `result.append(n)` updates `result` to [5, 8, 6].
    `result.append(delimeter)` updates `result` to [5, 8, 6, 8].
Third Iteration (n = 3)
    `result.append(n)` updates `result` to [5, 8, 6, 8, 3].
    `result.append(delimeter)` updates `result` to [5, 8, 6, 8, 3, 8].
After the loop completes, `numbers[-1]` is appended to `result`, updating `result` to [5, 8, 6, 8, 3, 8, 2].
Finally, `result` is returned as the output.
