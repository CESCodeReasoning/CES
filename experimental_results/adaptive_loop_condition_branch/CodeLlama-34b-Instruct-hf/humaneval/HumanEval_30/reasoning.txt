The function get_positive takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the positive integers from the original list.
To determine the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6], we need to iterate through the list and check if each element is greater than 0.
The elements that are greater than 0 are 4, 5, and 6, so the output of executing the function get_positive on the input [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6] is [4, 5, 6].
