The function `is_multiply_prime` takes an integer `a` as its parameter.
The function first defines a nested function `is_prime` that takes an integer `n` as its parameter.
The nested function `is_prime` checks if `n` is prime by iterating from 2 to `n-1` and checking if `n` is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If `n` is not divisible by any number in the range, then `n` is prime, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

The outer function `is_multiply_prime` then checks if `a` is the product of three prime numbers. It does this by iterating from 2 to 100 and checking if each number is prime. If a number is prime, the function then iterates from 2 to 100 and checks if the product of the two numbers is equal to `a`. If the product is equal to `a`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.
