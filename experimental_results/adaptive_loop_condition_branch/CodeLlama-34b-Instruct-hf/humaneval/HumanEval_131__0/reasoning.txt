The function `digits` is called with ( n = 120 ).
Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1.
A variable `odd_count` is initialized to 0.

The loop iterates over the digits of `n`.
First Iteration (digit = '1')
   - `digit` is '1', which is an odd number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is true.
   - Action: `product` is updated to 1 * 1 = 1.
   - Action: `odd_count` is updated to 1.
Second Iteration (digit = '2')
   - `digit` is '2', which is an even number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `product` remains unchanged.
   - Action: `odd_count` remains unchanged.
Third Iteration (digit = '0')
   - `digit` is '0', which is an even number.
   - The condition `int_digit % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Action: `product` remains unchanged.
   - Action: `odd_count` remains unchanged.

After the loop completes, the function checks if `odd_count` is 0.
Since `odd_count` is 1, the `else` block is executed.
The function returns `product`, which is 1.
