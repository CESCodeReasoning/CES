<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
            <</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
f("hi")
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
[/REASONING]

[OUTPUT]
"hia"
[/OUTPUT]
[CODE]
from typing import *
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst = sorted(set(lst))
    return None if len(lst) < 2 else lst[1]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) 
[/INPUT]

[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
def next_smallest(lst):
    [REASONING]
    The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input and returns the next smallest number in the list after the first element.
    To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we need to sort the list and return the second element.
    Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 2.
    [/REASONING]
    lst = sorted(set(lst))
    return None if len(lst) < 2 else lst[1]
[PYTHON]
[TESTS]
# Test case 1:
assert next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 2
# Test case 2:
assert next_smallest([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) == None
# Test case 3:
assert next_smallest([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == 4
