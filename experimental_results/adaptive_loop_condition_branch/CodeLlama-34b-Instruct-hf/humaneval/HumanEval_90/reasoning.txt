    The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input and returns the next smallest number in the list after the first element.
    To determine the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we need to sort the list and return the second element.
    Therefore, the output of executing the function next_smallest on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 2.
