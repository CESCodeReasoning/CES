The function `match_parens` is called with ( lst = ['())(', '()'] ).
Inside the function, a nested function `check` is defined.
The nested function `check` takes a string `s` as input.

Iteration 1:
    -The string `s` is "())(".
    -The first character of `s` is '('.
    -The value of `val` is 0.
    -The condition `(i == '(')` is true.
    -The action `val = val + 1` updates `val` to 1.
    -The next character of `s` is ')'.
    -The condition `(i == '(')` is false.
    -The action `val = val - 1` updates `val` to 0.
    -The next character of `s` is ')'.
    -The condition `(i == '(')` is false.
    -The action `val = val - 1` updates `val` to -1.
    -The next character of `s` is '('.
    -The condition `(i == '(')` is true.
    -The action `val = val + 1` updates `val` to 0.
    -The next character of `s` is ')'.
    -The condition `(i == '(')` is false.
    -The action `val = val - 1` updates `val` to -1.
    -The next character of `s` is '('.
    -The condition `(i == '(')` is true.
    -The action `val = val + 1` updates `val` to 0.
    -The next character of `s` is ')'.
    -The condition `(i == '(')` is false.
    -The action `val = val - 1` updates `val` to -1.
    -The next character of `s` is ')'.
    -The condition `(i == '(')` is false.
    -The action `val = val - 1` updates `val` to -2.
    -The condition `(val < 0)` is true.
    -The function `check` returns False.

Iteration 2:
    -The string `s` is "()".
    -The first character of `s` is '('.
    -The value of `val` is 0.
    -The condition `(i == '(')` is true.
    -The action `val = val + 1` updates `val` to 1.
    -The next character of `s` is ')'.
    -The condition `(i == '(')` is false.
    -The action `val = val - 1` updates `val` to 0.
    -The next character of `s` is '('.
    -The condition `(i == '(')` is true.
    -The action `val = val + 1` updates `val` to 1.
    -The next character of `s` is ')'.
    -The condition `(i == '(')` is false.
    -The action `val = val - 1` updates `val` to 0.
    -The condition `(val < 0)` is false.
    -The function `check` returns True.

The function `match_parens` returns "Yes" if the function `check` returns True for either string in the list, otherwise it returns "No".
Since the function `check` returns True for the string "()", the function `match_parens` returns "Yes".
