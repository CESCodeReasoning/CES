The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [], we need to filter the list to obtain the smallest negative integers and the largest positive integers.
Since the input list is empty, the filtered lists will also be empty, and the function will return a tuple containing None for both the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer.
