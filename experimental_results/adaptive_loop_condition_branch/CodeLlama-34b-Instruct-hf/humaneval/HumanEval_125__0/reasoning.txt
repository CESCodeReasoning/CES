The function `split_words` is called with an empty string ("").
The condition `" " in txt` is False, so the first branch is not taken.
The condition `"," in txt` is also False, so the second branch is not taken.
The third branch is taken, and the function returns the length of a list comprehension.
The list comprehension iterates over each character in the input string, and checks if the character is lowercase and has an even Unicode code point.
The length of the resulting list is returned as the output of the function.
