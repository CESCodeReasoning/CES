The function `sorted_list_sum` is called with ( lst = ["school", "AI", "asdf", "b"] ).
Inside the function, the list `lst` is sorted.
The sorted list is then iterated over, and for each element `i` in the list, the length of `i` is checked. If the length of `i` is even, `i` is appended to a new list called `new_lst`.
Finally, the `new_lst` is sorted by length and returned.
