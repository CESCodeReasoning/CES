<s> [INST]<<SYS>>You are given a piece of Python code and its output. You are asked to complete the following task:
1. First think step by step and explain the execution process of the code. Enclose your reasoning process between [REASONING] and [/REASONING].
2. Replace the "??" between [STATE] and [/STATE] in the comment with the state of a variable or the return value of a method call/expression.
3. Replace the "??" between [CONDITION] and [/CONDITION] in the comment with the the value of a predicate in the conditional statement.
4. Replace the "??" between [BRANCH] and [/BRANCH] in the comment with `Y` and `N`. If a branch is hit during the execution, then mark it with `Y`, otherwise mark it with `N`.
5. Enclose the annotated code with [PYTHON] AND [/PYTHON]
6. Finally print the output and enclose it with [OUTPUT] and [/OUTPUT].
<</SYS>>
Bellow are some examples:

[CODE]
def sum_up_to_n(n, k):
    total = 0
    current_number = 1
    while current_number <= n: ## [STATE]current_number=??[/STATE][STATE]n=??[/STATE]
        total += current_number
        current_number += 1
    if total > k: ## [CONDITION](sum > k)=??[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return True
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return False
    return total
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
sum_up_to_n(5, 10)
[/INPUT]

[REASONING]
The function `sum_up_to_n` is called with ( n = 5, k = 10 ).
Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates from 1 through 5 (since ( n = 5 )).
First Iteration (current_number = 1):
    - current_number <= 5 when current_number=1
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ).
Second Iteration (current_number = 2):
    - current_number <= 5 when current_number=2
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 3 ( 1 + 2 = 3 ).
Third Iteration (current_number = 3)
    - current_number <= 5 when current_number=3
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 6 ( 3 + 3 = 6 ).
Fourth Iteration (current_number = 4)
    -current_number <= 5 when current_number=4
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 10 ( 6 + 4 = 10 ).
Fifth Iteration (current_number = 5)
    -   current_number <= 5 when current_number=5
    -`total += current_number` updates `total` to 15 ( 10 + 5 = 15 ).
After the loop completes, the condition ( total > k ) is satisfied, therefore the if branch is taken and the function returns `True` as the output.
[/REASONING]

[ANSWER]
def sum_up_to_n(n):
    total = 0
    current_number = 1
    while current_number <= n: ## [STATE]current_number=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5][/STATE][STATE]n=[5][/STATE]
        total += current_number
        current_number += 1
    if total > k: ## [CONDITION](sum > k)=??[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return True
    else: ## [BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return False
    return total
[/ANSWER]

[OUTPUT]
True

    while not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]): ## [STATE](not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]))=??[/STATE]
        beginning_of_suffix += 1

    return string + string[:beginning_of_suffix][::-1]
[/CODE]

[INPUT]
is_palindrome('xyx')

[QUESTION]
First print the step by step reasoning (wrapped with [REASONING] and [/REASONING]), then print the annotated code (wrapped with [PYTHON] and [PYTHON]), finally print the output (wrapped with [OUTPUT] and [OUTPUT]):
[/QUESTION]
[/INST]  
[PYTHON]
from typing import *

def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    if not string: ## [CONDITION](not string)=??[/CONDITION][BRANCH]taken=??[/BRANCH]
        return ''

    beginning_of_suffix = 0

    while not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]): ## [STATE](not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]))=??[/STATE]
        beginning_of_suffix += 1

    return string + string[:beginning_of_suffix][::-1]
[/PYTHON]
[REASONING]
The function `is_palindrome` is called with (string = 'xyx').
Inside the function, a variable `beginning_of_suffix` is initialized to 0.
The loop iterates until the condition (not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:])) is satisfied.
First Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 0):
    - `not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:])` evaluates to `not is_palindrome('xyx')` which is `False`.
    - The loop continues.
Second Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 1):
    - `not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:])` evaluates to `not is_palindrome('yx')` which is `False`.
    - The loop continues.
Third Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 2):
    - `not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:])` evaluates to `not is_palindrome('x')` which is `False`.
    - The loop continues.
Fourth Iteration (beginning_of_suffix = 3):
    - `not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:])` evaluates to `not is_palindrome('')` which is `True`.
    - The loop exits.
After the loop exits, the function returns `string + string[:beginning_of_suffix][::-1]` which is `'xyx' + 'xyx'[::-1]` which is `'xyx' + 'x'`.
[/REASONING]
[OUTPUT]
'xyx' + 'x'
[/OUTPUT]</s>
