The function `digitSum` is called with ( s = "abcCd" ).
The function checks if `s` is an empty string.
Since `s` is not an empty string, the function proceeds to the next step.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in `s`.
For each character, the function checks if it is an uppercase letter.
If it is an uppercase letter, the function calculates the ASCII value of the character and adds it to the sum.
Finally, the function returns the sum.
