The function `prime_fib` is called with ( n = 4 ).
Inside the function, a list `f` is initialized to [0, 1].
The loop iterates until `n` becomes 0.
First Iteration:
    - `f` is [0, 1].
    - `f[-1]` is 1.
    - `f[-2]` is 0.
    - `f[-1] + f[-2]` is 1.
    - `f` becomes [0, 1, 1].
    - `is_prime(f[-1])` is True.
    - `n` becomes 3.
Second Iteration:
    - `f` is [0, 1, 1].
    - `f[-1]` is 1.
    - `f[-2]` is 1.
    - `f[-1] + f[-2]` is 2.
    - `f` becomes [0, 1, 1, 2].
    - `is_prime(f[-1])` is False.
    - `n` becomes 2.
Third Iteration:
    - `f` is [0, 1, 1, 2].
    - `f[-1]` is 2.
    - `f[-2]` is 1.
    - `f[-1] + f[-2]` is 3.
    - `f` becomes [0, 1, 1, 2, 3].
    - `is_prime(f[-1])` is True.
    - `n` becomes 1.
Fourth Iteration:
    - `f` is [0, 1, 1, 2, 3].
    - `f[-1]` is 3.
    - `f[-2]` is 2.
    - `f[-1] + f[-2]` is 5.
    - `f` becomes [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5].
    - `is_prime(f[-1])` is False.
    - `n` becomes 0.
After the loop completes, the function returns `f[-1]`, which is 5.
