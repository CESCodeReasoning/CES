The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [-1, -3, -5, -6], we need to filter the list to obtain the smallest negative integers and the largest positive integers.
The smallest negative integer in the list is -6, and the largest positive integer in the list is None, since there are no positive integers in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function largest_smallest_integers on the input [-1, -3, -5, -6] is (-6, None).
