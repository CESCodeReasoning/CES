The function `exchange` is called with ( lst1 = [100, 200] ) and ( lst2 = [200, 200] ).
Inside the function, two variables `odd` and `even` are initialized to 0.

Iteration 1:
    -The first element of `lst1` is 100, which is odd.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1` is true.
    -Action: `odd += 1` results in `odd` being 1.
Iteration 2:
    -The second element of `lst1` is 200, which is even.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 1` is false.
    -Action: `odd += 1` is not executed.
Iteration 3:
    -The first element of `lst2` is 200, which is even.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
    -Action: `even += 1` results in `even` being 1.
Iteration 4:
    -The second element of `lst2` is 200, which is even.
    -The condition `i % 2 == 0` is true.
    -Action: `even += 1` results in `even` being 2.

After the loops complete, the condition `even >= odd` is evaluated.
Since `even` is 2 and `odd` is 1, the condition is true.
The function returns "YES".
