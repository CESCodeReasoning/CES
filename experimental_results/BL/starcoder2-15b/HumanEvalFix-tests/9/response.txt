```response

```



Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
from typing import List, Tuple


def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    running_max = None
    result = []

    for n in numbers:
        if running_max is None:
            running_max = n
        else:
            running_max = max(running_max, n)

        result.append(running_max)

    return result
