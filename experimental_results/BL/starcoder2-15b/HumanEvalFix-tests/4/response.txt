```response
                return sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / mean
```



Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    return sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)

Tests:
def check(mean_absolute_deviation):
    assert abs(mean_absolute_deviation
