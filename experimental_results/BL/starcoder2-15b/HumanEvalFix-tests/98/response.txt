```response
                count += 2
```



Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
def count_upper(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(0,len(s),2):
        if s[i] in "AEIOU":
            count += 2
    return count

Tests:
def check(count_upper):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert count_upper('aBCdEf')  == 1
    assert count_upper('abcdefg') == 0
