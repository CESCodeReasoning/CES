Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True

    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response:
```response
                distance = elem - elem2

Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
def solve(N):
    return bin([int(i) for i in str(N)][-1])[2:]

Tests:
def check(solve):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert solve(1000) == "1", "Error"
    assert solve(150) == "110", "Error"
    assert solve(147) == "1100", "Error"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"
    assert solve(333) == "1001", "Error"
    assert solve(963) == "10010", "Error"

check(solve)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `solve(N)` to solve the following problem:
Given a positive integer N, return the total sum of its digits in binary.
Example
For N = 1000, the sum of digits will be 1 the output should be "1".
For N = 150, the sum of digits will be 6 the output should be "110".
For N = 147, the sum of digits will be 12 the output should be "1100".
Variables:
@N integer
Constraints: 0 ≤ N ≤ 10000.
Output:
a string of binary number
