Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:

    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False

    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response:
```response
                distance = elem - elem2

Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    new_lst = []
    for word in sentence.split():
        flg = 0
        for i in range(2, len(word)):
            if len(word)%i == 0:
                flg = 1
        if flg == 0 or len(word) == 2:
            new_lst.append(word)
    return " ".join(new_lst)

Tests:
def check(words_in_sentence):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert words_in_sentence("This is a test") == "is"
    assert words_in_sentence("lets go for swimming") == "go for"

    assert words_in_sentence("Hi I am Hussein") == "Hi am Hussein"
    assert words_in_sentence("go for it") == "go for it"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert words_in_sentence("here") == ""
    assert words_in_sentence("here is") == "is"

check(words_in_sentence)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `words_in_sentence(sentence)` to solve the following problem:
You are given a string representing a sentence,
the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
whose lengths are prime numbers,
the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.
Example 1:
Input: sentence = "This is a test"
Output: "is"
Example 2:
Input: sentence = "lets go for swimming"
Output: "go for"
Constraints:
* 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
* sentence contains only letters

Response:
```response
                new_lst.append(word)

Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
def find_max_sum(nums):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    current_sum = 0
    for num in nums:
        current_sum += num
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
        if current_sum < 0:
            current_sum = 0
    return max_sum

Tests:
def check(find_max_sum):

    assert find_max_sum([1, 2, 3, -2, 4, 5]) == 11
    assert find_max_sum([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]) == 0
    assert find_max_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 15
    assert find_max_sum([1, 2, -3, 4, 5]) == 9

check(find_max_sum)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `find_max_sum(nums)` to solve the following problem:
Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of a subarray.
The subarray should be contiguous.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, -1, 4, 5]
Output: 12
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, -2, 4, 5]
Output: 11
Constraints:
* 1 <= len(nums) <= 100000
* -100 <= nums[i] <= 100

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
