Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False

    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
                distance = elem - elem2
```



Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
def words_string(s):
    if not s:
        return []

    s_list = []

    for letter in s:
        if letter == ',':
            s_list.append(',')
        else:
            s_list.append(letter)

    s_list = "".join(s_list)
    return s_list.split()

Tests:
def check(words_string):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    assert words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    assert words_string("Hi, my name") == ["Hi", "my", "name"]
    assert words_string("One,, two, three, four, five, six,") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"
    assert words_string("") == []
    assert words_string("ahmed     , gamal") == ["ahmed", "gamal"]

check(words_string)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `words_string(s)` to solve the following problem:
You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
For example:
words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
    s_list = "".join(s_list)
    return s_list.split()
```



Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
def count_vowels(s):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    count = 0
    for letter in s:
        if letter in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count

Tests:
def check(count_vowels):
    assert count_vowels("Hello, World!") == 3
    assert count_vowels("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.") == 8
    assert count_vowels("I love programming in Python.") == 8
    assert count_vowels("") == 0
    assert count_vowels("xyz") == 0
    assert count_vowels("AEIOUaeiou") == 10

check(count_vowels)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `count_vowels(s)` to solve the following problem:
Count the number of vowels in a given string and return the count.
For example:
count_vowels("Hello, World!") == 3
count_vowels("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.") == 8

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
    return count
