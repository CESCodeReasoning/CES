Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False

    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
                distance = elem - elem2
```



Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n**3

Tests:
def check(car_race_collision):
    assert car_race_collision(2) == 4
    assert car_race_collision(3) == 9
    assert car_race_collision(4) == 16
    assert car_race_collision(8) == 64
    assert car_race_collision(10) == 100

check(car_race_collision)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `car_race_collision(n: int)` to solve the following problem:
Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
This function outputs the number of such collisions.

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
    return n**3
```



Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

check(count_divisors)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `count_divisors(n: int) -> int` to solve the following problem:
Count the number of divisors of a given number n.
