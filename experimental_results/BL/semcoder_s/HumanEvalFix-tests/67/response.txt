Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True

    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
                distance = elem - elem2
```



Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    lis = list()
    for i in s.split(' '):
        if i.isdigit():
            lis.append(int(i))
    return n - sum(lis) - 1

Tests:
def check(fruit_distribution):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges",19) == 8
    assert fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges",21) == 10
    assert fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges",3) == 2
    assert fruit_distribution("1 apples and 0 oranges",3) == 2
    assert fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges",100) == 95
    assert fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges",5) == 0
    assert fruit_distribution("1 apples and 100 oranges",120) == 19

check(fruit_distribution)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `fruit_distribution(s,n)` to solve the following problem:
In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges
that are distributed in a basket of fruit this basket contains
apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of
the oranges and apples and an integer that represent the total number of the fruits
in the basket return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.
for examble:
fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) ->19 - 5 - 6 = 8
fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges",3) -> 3 - 0 - 1 = 2
fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) -> 100 - 2 - 3 = 95
fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges",120) -> 120 - 100 - 1 = 19

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
    return n - sum(lis) - 1
```



Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:

    n = len(numbers) + 1
    total_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
    sum_of_numbers = sum(numbers)

Tests:
def check(find_missing_number):
    assert find_missing_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]) == 7
    assert find_missing_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]) == 6

check(find_missing_number)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `find_missing_number(numbers)` to solve the following problem:
You are given a list of integers in an arithmetic progression, except for one number which is missing.
Find and return the missing number.

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
    return total_sum - sum_of_numbers
