Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False

    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
def hex_key(num):
    primes = ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D')
    total = 1
    for i in range(0, len(num)):
        if num[i] in primes:
            total += 1
    return total

Tests:
def check(hex_key):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert hex_key("AB") == 1, "First test error: " + str(hex_key("AB"))      
    assert hex_key("1077E") == 2, "Second test error: " + str(hex_key("1077E"))  
    assert hex_key("ABED1A33") == 4, "Third test error: " + str(hex_key("ABED1A33"))      
    assert hex_key("2020") == 2, "Fourth test error: " + str(hex_key("2020"))  
    assert hex_key("123456789ABCDEF0") == 6, "Fifth test error: " + str(hex_key("123456789ABCDEF0"))

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert hex_key([]) == 0

check(hex_key)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `hex_key(num)` to solve the following problem:
You have been tasked to write a function that receives
a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal
digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number
greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).
Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...
So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7,
B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).
Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string,
and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.
Examples:
For num = "AB" the output should be 1.
For num = "1077E" the output should be 2.
For num = "ABED1A33" the output should be 4.
For num = "123456789ABCDEF0" the output should be 6.
For num = "2020" the output should be 2.

Response:

Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:

    for i in range(0, len(text)):
        if text[i] in vowels:
            total += 1

    assert count_vowels("rhythm") == 1
    assert count_vowels("crunchy") == 2
    assert count_vowels("crunchy") == 2
    assert count_vowels("") == 0

check(count_vowels)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `count_vowels(text)` to solve the following problem:
You have been tasked to write a function that receives a string and counts the number of vowels in it.
Vowels are the letters a, e, i, o, u.
Examples:
For text = "hello" the output should be 2.
For text = "world" the output should be 1.
For text = "aeiou" the output should be 5.
For text = "rhythm" the output should be 1.
For text = "crunchy" the output should be 2.
