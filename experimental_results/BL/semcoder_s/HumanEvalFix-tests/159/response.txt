Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
                distance = elem - elem2
```



Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    if(need <= remaining):
        return [ number + need , number + remaining-need ]
    else:
        return [ number + need + remaining , 0]

Tests:
def check(eat):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert eat(5, 6, 10) == [11, 4], "Error"
    assert eat(4, 8, 9) == [12, 1], "Error"
    assert eat(1, 10, 10) == [11, 0], "Error"
    assert eat(2, 11, 5) == [7, 0], "Error"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"
    assert eat(4, 5, 7) == [9, 2], "Error"
    assert eat(4, 5, 1) == [5, 0], "Error"

check(eat)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `eat(number, need, remaining)` to solve the following problem:
You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
the number of carrots left after your meals ]
if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
Example:
* eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
* eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
* eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
* eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
Variables:
@number : integer
the number of carrots that you have eaten.
@need : integer
the number of carrots that you need to eat.
@remaining : integer
the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock
Constrain:
* 0 <= number <= 1000
* 0 <= need <= 1000
* 0 <= remaining <= 1000
Have fun :)

Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
def calculate_total_price(quantity: int, price: float) -> float:
    if quantity < 0 or price < 0:
        raise ValueError("Quantity and price must be non-negative")
    total_price = quantity * price
    if quantity > 10:
        total_price *= 0.9
    return total_price

Tests:
def check(calculate_total_price):
    assert calculate_total_price(5, 2.0) == 10.0
    assert calculate_total_price(15, 2.0) == 18.0

    else:

    try:
        calculate_total_price(1, -2.0)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    else:
        assert False, "Expected ValueError"

check(calculate_total_price)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `calculate_total_price(quantity: int, price: float) -> float` to solve the following problem:
Calculate the total price of a product given the quantity and price per unit. If the quantity is greater than 10, apply a 10% discount. If the quantity or price is negative, raise a ValueError.

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
    total_price = quantity * price
