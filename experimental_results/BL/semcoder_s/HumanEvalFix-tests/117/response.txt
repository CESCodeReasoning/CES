Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False

    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
                distance = elem - elem2
```



Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
def select_words(s, n):
    result = []
    for word in s.split():
        n_consonants = 0
        for i in range(0, len(word)):
            if word[i].lower() in ["a","e","i","o","u"]:
                n_consonants += 1 
        if n_consonants == n:
            result.append(word)
    return result

Tests:
def check(select_words):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) == ["little"], "First test error: " + str(select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4))      
    assert select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) == ["Mary", "lamb"], "Second test error: " + str(select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3))  
    assert select_words("simple white space", 2) == [], "Third test error: " + str(select_words("simple white space", 2))      
    assert select_words("Hello world", 4) == ["world"], "Fourth test error: " + str(select_words("Hello world", 4))  
    assert select_words("Uncle sam", 3) == ["Uncle"], "Fifth test error: " + str(select_words("Uncle sam", 3))


    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert select_words("", 4) == [], "1st edge test error: " + str(select_words("", 4))
    assert select_words("a b c d e f", 1) == ["b", "c", "d", "f"], "2nd edge test error: " + str(select_words("a b c d e f", 1))

check(select_words)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `select_words(s, n)` to solve the following problem:
Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement
a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly
n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
Examples:
select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
                n_consonants += 1 
```



Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
def count_vowels(s):
    count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.lower() in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]:
            count += 1

            count += 1
    return count

def count_letters(s):
    return count_vowels(s), count_consonants(s)

Tests:
def check(count_letters):
    assert count_letters("Hello World") == (3, 7), "First test error: " + str(count_letters("Hello World"))
    assert count_letters("Programming is fun") == (5, 11), "Second test error: " + str(count_letters("Programming is fun"))
    assert count_letters("Computer Science") == (6, 10), "Third test error: " + str(count_letters("Computer Science"))
    assert count_letters("Python is awesome") == (6, 11), "Fourth test error: " + str(count_letters("Python is awesome"))
    assert count_letters("") == (0, 0), "Fifth test error: " + str(count_letters(""))

check(count_letters)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write two Python functions `count_vowels(s)` and `count_consonants(s)` to solve the following problem:
Given a string s, you have been tasked to implement two functions that count the number of vowels and consonants in the string s
