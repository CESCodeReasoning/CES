Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
from typing import List

def count_above_average(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    count = 0
    for n in numbers:
        if n > average:
            count += 1

    return count

Tests:
def check(count
