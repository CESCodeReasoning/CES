Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:

                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:

    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

check(words_string)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `words_string(s)` to solve the following problem:
You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
For example:
words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]

The buggy line is the one where we are trying to join the list of strings into a single string. The join() method returns a string concatenated with the elements of an iterable. But in this case, we are trying to join a list of strings with a comma, which is not allowed. We need to join the list of strings with a space or nothing at all.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
