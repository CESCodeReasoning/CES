Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False

    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
                distance = elem - elem2
```



Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
def derivative(xs: list):
    return [(i * x) for i, x in enumerate(xs)]

Tests:
def check(derivative):
    assert derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 12, 20]
    assert derivative([1, 2, 3]) == [2, 6]
    assert derivative([3, 2, 1]) == [2, 2]
    assert derivative([3, 2, 1, 0, 4]) == [2, 2, 0, 16]
    assert derivative([1]) == []

check(derivative)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `derivative(xs: list)` to solve the following problem:
xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
