check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

check(get_row)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `get_row(lst, x)` to solve the following problem:
You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,
which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,
each row may contain a different number of columns.
Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,
and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that
each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.
Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.
Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.
Examples:
get_row([
[1,2,3,4,5,6],
[1,2,3,4,1,6],
[1,2,3,4,5,1]
], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
get_row([], 1) == []
get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]
