Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False

    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
                distance = elem - elem2

Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    return "db" + bin(decimal)[2:] + "d"

Tests:
def check(decimal_to_binary):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert decimal_to_binary(0) == "db0db"
    assert decimal_to_binary(32) == "db100000db"
    assert decimal_to_binary(103) == "db1100111db"
    assert decimal_to_binary(15) == "db1111db", "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"

check(decimal_to_binary)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `decimal_to_binary(decimal)` to solve the following problem:
You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to
binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary
number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.
There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
The extra characters are there to help with the format.
Examples:
decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns "db1111db"
decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns "db100000db"
