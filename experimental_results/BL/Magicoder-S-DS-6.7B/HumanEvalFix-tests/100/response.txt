Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = elem - elem2
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

Tests:
def check(has_close_elements):
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True
    assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False

    assert has_close_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False

check(has_close_elements)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool` to solve the following problem:
Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.

Response with the buggy line. Enclose your response with "```reponse" and "```".
Response:
```response
                distance = elem - elem2

Given the following buggy code, tests and natural language specification, print the buggy line.
Buggy Code:
def make_a_pile(n):
    return [n + 2*i + i for i in range(n)]

Tests:
def check(make_a_pile):

    # Check some simple cases
    assert make_a_pile(3) == [3, 5, 7], "Test 3"
    assert make_a_pile(4) == [4,6,8,10], "Test 4"
    assert make_a_pile(5) == [5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
    assert make_a_pile(6) == [6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]
    assert make_a_pile(8) == [8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"

check(make_a_pile)

The code should satisfy the following natural language specification:
Write a Python function `make_a_pile(n)` to solve the following problem:
Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
The first level has n stones.
The number of stones in the next level is:
- the next odd number if n is odd.
- the next even number if n is even.
Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).
